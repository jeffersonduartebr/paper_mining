Implementing the LSEESC Methodology with AI-Guided Support for Active Learning in Engineering Physics Courses,"In this research-to-practice full work, we will explore how innovative educational strategies can improve students' learning experiences. Specifically, we will focus on the early development of skills in engineering students, such as numerical manipulation for problem-solving, proficient spreadsheet management, experimental implementation, and mastery of mathematical modeling complemented by informed decision-making with graphics understanding and interpretation. The effective utilization of available technological resources helps to enhance the student learning experience and prepare them for the challenges in their engineering professional practice. Physics courses often present high rates of low academic performance, but these innovative approaches can enhance active student engagement and help nurture essential skills. However, integrating technology into innovative teaching methods can have implications; one seen recently is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (G-AI) in many instruction courses; as a technology of easy access and manipulation, it can result in a confused tool if students don't have the appropriate instruction in its use. Therefore, educating students on the ethical and proper use of AI technology is crucial, guiding them in formulating relevant questions and accurately interpreting the results. To achieve this, we used the Learning Science and Engineering with Electronic Spreadsheets Cycle (LSEESC) methodology, which has been rigorously tested across various contexts over the last four years and has shown promising results. We will support its implementation with comprehensive guidance and use Artificial Intelligence as a prompt/chat tool (e.g., Chat GPT) as a supplementary tool. This strategy aimed to help students develop effective study habits for independent study sessions and promote autonomous learning. We examine how students ask for help from AI, including their choice of words and language. We will also investigate the effects of using casual or informal language and suggest guidelines for constructing practical questions. Our goal was to assist students in obtaining a better understanding and explanations of physics concepts and problem-solving exercises with the help of AI combined with a well-defined methodology, like the LSEESC, which promotes the development of skills like numerical manipulation, mathematical modeling, variables understanding, graphics generation, interpretation, and understanding. The learning intervention considers N = 140 students for working on the LSEESC methodology and using G-AI in physics courses during spring 2024, with students in the first year of academic engineering programs. The topics to evidence the learning process are kinematics and electrics. The results were analyzed with the Normalized Conceptual Gain (NCG) given a value of <g> = 0.75 and 0.67, the Concentration Factor (CF), Rasch's index, and qualitative students' question formulation. This is particularly important because, in some instances, the results provided by G-AI were incorrect owing to the system's inability to detect specific implications that a human can easily recognize; the teacher explained the confused results presented by G-AI and student received the corresponding feedback about these issues with artificial intelligence.","Instituto Politécnico Nacional - UPIIG., Silao de la Victoria, Mexico; Instituto Politécnico Nacional - UPIIG., Silao de la Victoria, Mexico",E.

Event-Triggered Deep Reinforcement Learning Using Parallel Control: A Case Study in Autonomous Driving,"This paper utilizes parallel control to investigate the problem of event-triggered deep reinforcement learning and develops an event-triggered deep Q-network (ETDQN) for decision-making of autonomous driving, without training an explicit triggering condition. Based on the framework of parallel control, the developed ETDQN incorporates information of actions into the feedback and constructs a dynamic control policy. First, in the realization of the dynamic control policy, we integrate the current state and the previous action to construct the augmented state as well as the augmented Markov decision process. Meanwhile, it is shown theoretically that the goal of the developed dynamic control policy is to learn the variation rate of the action. The augmented state contains information of the current state and the previous action, which enables the developed ETDQN to directly design the immediate reward considering communication loss. Then, based on dueling double deep Q-network (dueling DDQN), we establish the augmented action-value, value, and advantage functions to directly learn the optimal event-triggered decision-making policy of autonomous driving without an explicit triggering condition. It is worth noticing that the developed ETDQN applies to various deep Q-networks (DQNs). Empirical results demonstrate that, in event-triggered control, the developed ETDQN outperforms dueling DDQN and reduces communication loss effectively.","Parallel Intelligence Innovation Research Center, Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Qingdao, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Artificial Intelligence, Anhui University, Hefei, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",J.

Boosting Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning for Multiagent-Based Multimicrogrid Energy Management,"Privacy of user is becoming increasingly significant in constructing efficient multiagent energy management systems for multimicrogrid (MMG). As an emerging privacy-protection method, federated learning (FL) has been used to prevent data breaches in the MMG-related field. However, with the ever-growing participants, the underlying communication burden existing in FL is evident. Besides, since the neural network layers collectively determine an agent’s performance, the possible difference in layer convergence speeds would cause the inconsistency problem, that is, the FL may degrade the convergence rate of those fast-convergent layers, which weakens the overall performance of the agent. To address these issues, a communication-efficient FL (CEFL) algorithm is proposed in this study. Considering the cooperative relationship among layers, a layer evaluation (LE) mechanism is developed in CEFL to evaluate layer contribution through the Shapley value (SV), a profit distribution approach for coalitions. In this way, only partial layers with the highest contributions are selected to be uploaded to the server. In addition, instead of average parameters aggregation, a communication-efficient parameter aggregation method is proposed in CEFL to update the parameters of the global model (GM), in which an aggregation model (AM) is developed to receive parameters for aggregation. The performance of the proposed CEFL is verified by the numerical analysis of MMGs with 3–8 MGs participating. Furthermore, experiments investigate the influence of the hyperparameter in the CEFL and also demonstrate performance improvements, compared with the other four state-of-the-art algorithms.","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Research Center for Grid Modernisation, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Electrical Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin, China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Research Center for Grid Modernisation, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China",S.

Event-Triggered Near-Optimal Control for Unknown Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems Using Parallel Control,"This article uses parallel control to investigate the problem of event-triggered near-optimal control (ETNOC) for unknown discrete-time (DT) nonlinear systems. First, to achieve parallel control, an augmented nonlinear system (ANS) with an augmented performance index (API) is proposed to introduce the control input into the feedback system. The control stability relationship between the ANS and the original system is analyzed, and it is shown that, by choosing a proper API, optimal control of the ANS with the API can be seen as near-optimal control of the original system with the original performance index (OPI). Second, based on parallel control, a novel event-triggered scheme is proposed, and then a novel ETNOC method is developed using the time-triggered optimal value function of the ANS with the API. The control stability is proved, and an upper bound, which is related to the design parameter, is provided for the actual performance index in advance. Then, to implement the developed ETNOC method for unknown DT nonlinear systems, a novel online learning algorithm is developed without reconstructing unknown systems, and neural network (NN) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques are employed in the developed algorithm. The convergence of the signals in the closed-loop system (CLS) is shown using the Lyapunov approach, and the assumption of boundedness of input dynamics is not required. Finally, two simulations justify the theoretical conjectures.","School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",J.

"Process Monitoring, Diagnosis and Control of Additive Manufacturing","Additive manufacturing (AM) can build up complex parts in a layer-by-layer manner, which is a kind of novel and flexible production technology. The special manufacturing capability of AM shows great application potential in various fields. However, an open-loop control method cannot guarantee the reliability and repeatability of an AM process. Defects often occur to deteriorate product quality and lead to material and time waste, which hinders the development of AM industry. In this regard, a lot of efforts have been made to make an AM process more controllable. This work proposes an AM control framework that divides the related studies into three feedback loops, including the in-situ monitoring of process defects, fault diagnosis of 3-D printers, and closed-loop control of an AM process. These three loops constitute the inspection and control of AM from the machine level to product level. Specifically, the measurement requirements for monitoring techniques, defect detection, fault diagnosis, and closed-loop control are summarized. The challenges and future trends in realizing a more reliable and repeatable AM process are discussed. Note to Practitioners—This survey is motivated by urgent need to solve product quality problems in additive manufacturing (AM) caused by open-loop control. Three feedback loops can be established to solve them. The first one is defect detection that inspects part quality during fabrication. The second one is the fault diagnosis of a 3-D printer that monitors the health and operation conditions of its actuators. The last one is closed-loop control that improves AM process reliability and repeatability by regulating process variables in real time. These three loops are all based on the feedback signals of in-situ monitoring systems. This paper reviews the related studies and provides guidance for establishing the monitoring systems, performing defect detection and fault diagnosis, and designing closed-loop control systems, which helps realize more reliable and repeatable AM.","State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Technology, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Technology, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Technology, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering and the School of Automation Science and Engineering, Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, Xi’an, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Technology, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Technology, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems, Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Systems and Technology, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",Q.

The Impact of Virtual Learning Environments on the Practical Skills of Open Distance Learning Students in Electrical Engineering,"Open distance learning (ODL) education has been developing rapidly in South Africa. The main reason behind the growth is the demand for online studies created due to the corona pandemic. The ODL system involves study that is not limited by geographical boundaries and extends to many knowledge areas electronically. In practice the study tends to extend to knowledge areas beyond those offered by the standard contact or traditional universities. At the University of South Africa (UNISA), the adoption of the ODL framework to theoretical subjects has been successful by making use of the Sakai virtual learning environment (VLE). The practical subjects or practical knowledge areas on the other hand have previously been taught face-to-face. Therefore, the practical modules have not been effectively taught online particularly in the electrical engineering curriculum. This issue can contribute to graduates who are unskilled in the practical component of a knowledge area, which can lead to unemployment. Virtual learning environments (VLE's) play a vital role when it comes to teaching and learning online. In this paper, the impact of VLE’s on the practical skills of students and practical knowledge is investigated. This is done by analyzing the change in pass rates of students in a practical subject such as Electrical Engineering when taught face-to-face as compared to when taught through a VLE such as Sakai online. Two groups termed as emerging centered learner (ECL) and a developed centered learner (DCL) are investigated. The method evaluates students who study electrical engineering practical module part-time. In this paper the Sakai platform was used as a VLE to teach and then evaluate students in the electrical engineering practical module. The practical guide with the full set of experiments was uploaded on Sakai under additional resources. The students were given the necessary guidelines and tasks via Sakai online, examined and then the pass rates achieved were analyzed at the end of the program and compared to the pass rates achieved using previous face-to-face teaching method used for the same practical’s. It was determined that a VLE can be used to improve the pass rates of a practical module such as electrical engineering taught online in ODL.","Electrical Engineering, University of South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa; Electrical Engineering, University of South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa",S.

A total of 176 junior college students from the University of Alicante Spain, and Silesian University of Technology, Poland participated in the study with B2-C1 language proficiency level of the CEFR and both native and non-native English users were included in the study. Data was collected from February to May, during the Spring term of the 2022 academic year and using two, two hour sessions per week whereby the participants devoted one month of their curriculum to this study. To determine the improvement on the language of the students, tests on the language Proficiency were given both before and after the intervention focusing on the changes on their use of vocabulary, grammar and fluency of the conversation. Quantitative feedback was obtained by use of quantitative questionnaires and tracking of the amount of time users invested in the chatbot and perception of learning. Altogether the study reveals that use of LSTM-based chatbots improves language learning outcomes especially in terms of vocabulary ability and grammatical skills. The participants also expressed higher involvement in terms of participating more in the interactions involving the chatbot and compliments for responsiveness and individuality of the chatbot. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that some obstacles including the provision of the complex language and emotional context were mentioned. Based on the findings, this study suggests that LSTM-based chatbots are very useful in language learning and still, more enhancements could still be made to mitigate these drawbacks and harness the chatbots' functionality for learning enhancement to the maximum.","Department of English, Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology, Chennai, India; Department of Science and Humanities, Dr. Mahalingam College of Engineering and Technology, Pollachi, India; Department of CSE, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun; Department of English, Nandha Engineering College (Autonomous), Erode, India; Department of English, Panimalar Engineering College, Chennai, India; Department of Languages, Institute of Finance and International Management, Bengaluru, India",B.

IoT-Enabled Pediatric Pain Care Leveraging Majority Vote-Based Transfer Learning Models,"Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to several advancements in healthcare such as remote patient monitoring, robotic surgery, and automated fall detection. Pediatric pain care is an important area that encompasses comprehensive practices dedicated to pediatric pain assessment, monitoring, and management. The objective of this paper is to integrate IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to design an automated monitoring and assessment system for pediatric pain care that includes a rapid response to detected pain experiences. To detect pain experiences in infants, we first trained seven Transfer Learning (TL) models (VGG19, DenseNet121, MobileNetv2, InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNetB0, Xception, and ResNet-50) using synthetic images generated with the stable diffusion model. Furthermore, to optimize the model’s performance, we employed a majority vote ensemble method where the final prediction is based on the majority of predictions from these TL models. We analyzed the combined effect of TL models by aggregating predictions from the top three, top five, and all seven TL models through majority voting. Using three TL models, achieved the highest accuracy of ${9 5 . 0 5 \%}$. Additionally, upon detecting signs of pain in infants, our system triggers audio or visual responses and alerts physicians or parents via a mobile app. This integrated approach enhances real-time pain assessment while enabling prompt and personalized interventions in pediatric pain care.","Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada; Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada; Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada; Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada",N.

Could the Use of AI in Higher Education Hinder Students With Disabilities? A Scoping Review,"Literature reviews on artificial intelligence (AI) have focused on the different applications of AI in higher education, the AI techniques used, and the benefits/risks of the use of AI. One of the greatest potentials of AI is to personalize higher education to the needs of students and offer timely feedback. This could benefit students with disabilities tremendously if their needs are also considered in the development of new AI educational technologies (EdTech). However, current reviews have failed to address the perspective of students with disabilities, which prompts ethical concerns. For instance, AI could treat people with disabilities as outliers in the data and end up discriminating against them. For that reason, this systematic literature review raises the following two questions: To what extent are ethical concerns considered in articles presenting AI applications assessing students (with disabilities) in higher education? What are the potential risks of using AI that assess students with disabilities in higher education? This scoping review highlights the lack of ethical reflection on AI technologies and an absence of discussion and inclusion of people with disabilities. Moreover, it identifies eight risks associated with the use of AI EdTech for students with disabilities. The review concludes with suggestions on how to mitigate these potential risks. Specifically, it advocates for increased attention to ethics within the field, the involvement of people with disabilities in research and development, as well as careful adoption of AI EdTech in higher education.","Institute of Computer Science, Zurich University of Applied Sciences School of Engineering, Winterthur, Switzerland; Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine (IBME), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Institute of Computer Science, Zurich University of Applied Sciences School of Engineering, Winterthur, Switzerland; Institute of Computer Science, Zurich University of Applied Sciences School of Engineering, Winterthur, Switzerland",O.

Physiological Signals-Driven Personal Thermal Comfort System Based on Environmental Intervention,"The primary objective of personal thermal comfort (PTC) is to enhance overall quality of life, encompassing well-being, productivity, and health. PTC necessitates the measurement of physiological responses and occupant preferences to generate intricate and dynamic comfort-related knowledge. This study introduces a comprehensive comfort-related processing framework that integrates physiological, environmental, and individual factors, examining physiological signals through occupant preference measurements within interventional chambers. Physiological signals, including skin temperature, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and airflow, are employed to portray an occupant’s physiological response to essential feature parameters. Additionally, variables such as age, sex, and body mass index are utilized to represent occupant preferences. The results reveal a highly significant relationship (p < 0.01) between physiological responses, taste, and satisfaction. This information serves as inputs to assist standard machine learning (ML) algorithms, categorized into probability, geometry, and logical expression, in encoding PTC and effectively predicting occupant satisfaction. The outcomes demonstrate that the logical decision tree, representing logical expression, along with k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks, representing geometry, achieved approximately 90%, 89%, and 80% of the average F-measure, respectively. These models exhibit superior accuracy in predicting individual occupant satisfaction compared to traditional approaches. This suggests their natural suitability for PTC-requiring intelligent systems.","School of Informatics, Walailak University (WU), Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand; School of Informatics, Walailak University (WU), Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand; School of Informatics, Walailak University (WU), Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand; School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; School of Informatics, Walailak University (WU), Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand",B.

Reinforcement Learning-Based News Recommendation System,"Recommender systems have seen wide adoption in different domains. The motive of such systems has evolved from providing generic recommendations in the past to providing customized and user-focused recommendations. To achieve this aim, the complexity and sophistication of the underlying techniques such systems use have evolved. Current recommender systems use advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to provide intelligent recommendations and adapt their future workings to the user’s interest and requirements.

Cloud-Based AIOT Soil Monitoring System for Earthworms,"Determining the soil conditions that are favourable to earthworm species is vital for maintaining soil health and improving agricultural yield. Timely reactions are constrained by the work-intensive nature of conventional soil monitoring techniques and their lack of real-time insights into characteristics of the soil. In order to address these issues, we created an Internet of Things (IoT) cloud-based soil monitoring system that tracks pH and moisture levels, two factors that are essential for earthworm survival, while utilizing clustering algorithms for categorizing soil conditions and Random Forest machine learning algorithms for predicting optimal habitats.

Modeling Tradeoffs Using Preference-Based Feedback in Session-Based Recommender Systems,"Cold-start is a challenge in most data-driven approaches across various paradigms of recommender systems research. Knowledge integration is becoming essential to alleviate the problem. Despite the availability of knowledge representations like the knowledge graph, there is a need for a richer semantic model to capture relationships among products in a domain. Recommender systems inspired by case-based reasoning uses rich domain knowledge in their recommendation process. Conversational case-based reasoning recommender systems (CCBR-RS) are session-based recommender systems that operate under cold-start assumptions. User preferences in such scenarios can only be learned based on the context of the current session. Tradeoffs have been used in literature to model the relationship among products in recommending appropriate products. The models in earlier works have been based on crisp sets, which lack flexibility in capturing varying degrees of tradeoffs, which is a more natural way of dealing with tradeoffs. This work proposes a flexible tradeoff representation scheme based on fuzzy sets to model tradeoffs in terms of linguistic terms and a fuzzy inference system that measures the similarity among tradeoffs represented in linguistic terms. We demonstrate the performance improvement in utilizing a more flexible model of tradeoffs by evaluating the methods on three datasets in a CCBR-RS framework.","Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras, Chennai, India; Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras, Chennai, India",A.

Enhancing Feedback Mechanisms in English Language Assessments Through Deep Learning Model,"In the realm of English language assessments, optimizing feedback mechanisms is crucial for enhancing learning outcomes and learner engagement. This paper therefore presents a new approach of increasing feedback enhancement by incorporating a Double Integral Transformer (DIT) model within the assessment process. The DIT model is an improved version of the regular Transformer architecture which employs two, or rather dual integral attention modules, to handle both the local and global contextual semantics of the language use more efficiently. With help of this model, the feedback process can be more accurate, accurate and individual for each learner. The Double Integral Transformer evaluates linguistic data by employing double attention layer that combines data at the syntactic and semantic level to enhance the quality of feedback given accurately. It improves the recognition of learners' strengths and weaknesses concerning the language in question and provides customized feedback that is apparently more accurate. The enhanced feeback mechanism reduces problems that are associated current assessment practices: for example, general feedback and lack of context awareness. In this study, the author presents the empirical support for the effectiveness of the DIT model to enhance the quality of the feedback is a major contribution of this study as it results in better learner performance and satisfaction. In this respect, the study advances the area's knowledge by demonstrating how novel types of Transformers can be integrated into educational technology systems while providing insights for possible changes to language assessments procedures.","Department of Verbal and Life Skills, Saveetha School of Engineering, SIMATS Engineering, Thandalam, Chennai; Department of ECE, Global Institute of Engineering and Technology (Autonomous), Hyderabad, India; Information Systems Department, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Department of CSE, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun; Adjunct Professor, Graphic Era Deemed to be University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India; Department of English, Kristu Jayanti College (Autonomous), Bengaluru, Karnataka; Assistant Professor of English Department of Languages, Institute of Finance and International Management, Bengaluru, India",M.

An Effective Tree-Structured AI Model for Reducing Overhead of Life Cycle Management in Wireless Communication,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied across various industries, including wireless communication. AI has been a topic of extensive discussion within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), particularly in the context of the physical layer. It involves applications such as beam management, positioning accuracy enhancement, and channel state information (CSI) feedback improvement. Evaluation results from various companies indicate significant gains in beam management and positioning through AI integration. While AI can replace traditional mechanisms to enhance performance, it also introduces new overheads. For example, the introduction of AI models necessitates addressing model life cycle management (LCM) issues, such as model identification, activation/deactivation, monitoring, updating/finetuning, selection, switching. These operations result in a significant amount of overhead. In this paper, we present the progress of model LCM in 3GPP, and also propose a tree-structured model to reduce the overhead associated with LCM operations. This model can be used in scenarios where multiple models serve the same functionality by merging similar structures, thereby saving storage space, and making the processes of model switching, expansion, and deletion more effective. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate that our approach maintains stable AI model performance while simplifying the model structure.","Wireless Network Research Department, Sony China Research Lab, Beijing, China; Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Wireless Network Research Department, Sony China Research Lab, Beijing, China; Sony Europe BV, Lund/Kista Branch, Sweden; Wireless Network Research Department, Sony China Research Lab, Beijing, China; Sony Europe BV, United Kingdom",Y.

"Evaluation of Smart Home Systems and Novel UV-Oriented Solution for Integration, Resilience, Inclusiveness & Sustainability","At present, smart Homes are receiving more attention as they are becoming the predominant space that houses people’s activities. Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.","Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Northeastern University, Boston, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Ningbo University, Ningbo, China; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Gannon University, Erie, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA; Universal Village Society, Cambridge, USA",L.

Bandit-supported care planning for older people with complex health and care needs,"Long-term care service for old people is in great demand in most of the aging societies. The number of nursing homes residents is increasing while the number of care providers is limited. Due to the care worker shortage, care to vulnerable older residents cannot be fully tailored to the unique needs and preference of each individual. This may bring negative impacts on health outcomes and quality of life among institutionalized older people. To improve care quality through personalized care planning and delivery with limited care workforce, we propose a new care planning model assisted by artificial intelligence. We apply bandit algorithms which optimize the clinical decision for care planning by adapting to the sequential feedback from the past decisions. We evaluate the proposed model on empirical data acquired from the Systems for Person-centered Elder Care (SPEC) study, a ICT-enhanced care management program.","Department of Industrial Engineering & Artificial Intelligence Graduate School, UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea; Master of Health Informatics, School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Statistics, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea",G. -S.

Research on Attention-Based Predictive Model in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Agent actions planning is a challenging problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent methods typically build their predictive models by full connection layers, but the shortage of utilizing action and observation information in complex multi-agent environment limits the performance of those methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel predictive model based on self-attention mechanism which can effectively use information in the environment. Specifically, we use the MADDPG algorithm to make a dataset where the input is the observations and actions and the output is the predicted observations and rewards. We also introduce the multi-head attention mechanism into the predictive model so that the predictive model can better combine different information for prediction. We perform extensive experiments to assess the proposed method and compare it with the representative baseline approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitors with higher accuracy in different tasks.

DRLLog: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Log Anomaly Detection,"System logs record the system’s status and application behavior, providing support for various system management and diagnostic tasks. However, existing methods for log anomaly detection face several challenges, including limitations in recognizing current types of anomalous logs and difficulties in performing online incremental updates to the anomaly detection models. To address these challenges, this paper introduces DRLLog, which applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) networks to detect anomalous events. DRLLog uses Deep Q Network (DQN) as the agent, with log entries serving as reward signals. By interacting with the environment generated from log data and adopting various action behaviors, it aims to maximize the reward value obtained as feedback. Through this approach, DRLLog achieves learning from historical log data and perception of the current environment, enabling continuous learning and adaptation to different log sequence patterns. Additionally, DRLLog introduces low-rank adaptation by using two low-rank parameter matrices in the fully connected layer of the DQN to represent changes in its weight matrix. During online model learning, only low-rank parameter matrices of the model are updated, effectively reducing the model’s overhead. Furthermore, DRLLog introduces focal loss to focus more on learning the features of anomalous logs, effectively addressing the issue of imbalanced quantities between normal and anomalous logs. We evaluated the performance on widely used log datasets, including HDFS, BGL and ThunderBird, showing an average improvement of 3% in F1-Score compared to baseline methods. During online model learning, DRLLog achieves an average reduction of 90% in parameter count and a significant decrease in training and testing time as well.","Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Sanya Science and Education Innovation Park, the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China",J.

The first stage aims to intensify the backbone’s perception of conversational context, the second stage propels the backbone into excavating the causes of the emotional distress faced by the seeker. In the third stage, we leverage a Bayesian method based on the seeker’s feedback scores to train a helpfulness evaluation model, then exploit a contrastive learning method to calibrate the ESC backbone. We conduct experiments on the standard multiturn ESC dataset, and the results demonstrate that BlenderBot-ThTra has a significant advantage in generating more supportive and adaptive responses.","School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China",G.

Toward eXplainabile Data-Driven Control (XDDC): The Property-Preserving Framework,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques continue to advance, the need for explainability becomes increasingly crucial, especially in sensitive or safety-critical domains. eXplainable AI (XAI) has emerged to address this need, aiming to enhance transparency in complex models. While XAI has gained traction in mainstream machine learning, its application in data-driven control systems remains relatively unexplored. This letter introduces a novel concept of explainability tailored for data-driven control, allowing one to design feedback loops from data incorporating prior knowledge and preserving important system properties. Through two case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of this property-preserving framework in direct and indirect data-driven control system design. This letter lays the foundation for further research at the intersection of AI and data-driven control, offering insights into enhancing transparency in complex control systems.","Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy",G.

Development of Helpdesk Chatbot for Incident Classification and Resolution using NPL and Deep Learning,"Nowadays, most people and companies are more likely to encounter technical problems related to computer equipment. Where the only option for a person to solve their problem is to go to a technical service center, which puts the physical equipment at risk as well as the integrity of the information due to external causes such as theft of information. Making a comparison at the business level, we find companies that are dedicated to offering services and consultancies dedicated to help desks, these services are contracted according to the needs of the company, these services are carried out through a ticket system, where there is no guarantee that the problem will be solved in the shortest time, regardless of the most common processes such as asking questions related to the use and operation of the computer equipment. In this work we developed a Chatbot, trained to be able to help with solutions related to help desk processes, having as a novelty the application of NPL and Deep Learning techniques. The results allow the Chatbot to be integrated as a first-line tool for the use of common users as well as specialized users in information technology areas.","Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Perú; Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Perú",D.

Design and Application of A Parallel Agent,"The parallel agent learns the model according to the environment feedback, and selects the appropriate amount of action. It consists of automatic modeling system, automatic simulation system and parallel execution system. The automatic modeling system sends an excitation signal to the environment and establishes the model according to the system state data. The automatic simulation system automatically carries out the step response simulation experiment by using predictive dynamic optimization technology. The parallel execution system will automatically switch with the actual system without disturbance, and carry out step disturbance test. If the performance is excellent, it will be put into application. The parallel agent is divided into two processes: learning and experiment. The learning process refers to that agents collect feedback information and learn the model. The experimental process refers to that the agent constructs the predictive dynamic optimization closed-loop control system based on the obtained model and carries out the step response simulation experiment, and switches to the actual system. If the step disturbance test has excellent performance, it will be put into operation. Based on the parallel control theory, the parallel agent automatically completes the whole process according to the step sequence and has a certain adaptive ability.","Department of device management, Zhejiang Datang Wushashan Power Generation Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China; Department of device management, Zhejiang Datang Wushashan Power Generation Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China; Department of device management, Zhejiang Datang Wushashan Power Generation Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China; Department of device management, Zhejiang Datang Wushashan Power Generation Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China; Center of Power Supply Technology, State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Research Institute, Hangzhou, China; Department of thermal technology, Hangzhou E.Energy Electric Power Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China",L.

Driver Profile and Driving Pattern Recognition for Road Safety Assessment: Main Challenges and Future Directions,"This study reviews the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches developed thus far for driver profile and driving pattern recognition, representing a set of macroscopic and microscopic behaviors respectively, to enhance the understanding of human factors in road safety, and therefore reduce the number of crashes. It provides a definition of the two scientific fields in terms of safety, and identifies the most efficient approaches used regarding methodology, data collection and driving metrics. Results show that K-means and Neural Networks are the most commonly used methodologies for driver profile identification, and Dynamic Time Warping for driving pattern detection. Most studies discovered driver profiles related to aggressiveness, considering mainly speed and acceleration as driving metrics. Based on the gaps and challenges identified, this paper provides a new framework for combining microscopic and macroscopic driving behavior analysis, instead of examining them separately as is the state-of-theart. Such combined results can potentially improve the development of traffic risk models, which could be exploited in applications that monitor drivers in real-time and provide feedback. These models will represent human behavior more accurately, which can eventually lead to the recognition of “optimal” human driving patterns that Automated Vehicles (AV) could ‘mimic’ to become safer.","Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management, Safety and Security Science Section, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands; Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management, Safety and Security Science Section, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands",D.

Developing Responsible Chatbots for Financial Services: A Pattern-Oriented Responsible Artificial Intelligence Engineering Approach,"The recent release of ChatGPT has gained huge attention and discussion worldwide, with responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) being a crucial topic of discussion. One key question is, “How can we ensure that AI systems, like ChatGPT, are developed and adopted in a responsible way?” To tackle RAI challenges, various ethical principles have been released by governments, organizations, and companies. However, those principles are very abstract and not practical enough. Further, significant efforts have been put on algorithm-level solutions that only address a narrow set of principles, such as fairness and privacy. To fill the gap, we adopt a pattern-oriented RAI engineering approach and build an RAI pattern catalog to operationalize RAI from a system perspective. In this article, we first summarize the major challenges in operationalizing RAI at scale and introduce how we use the RAI pattern catalog to address those challenges. We then examine the risks at each stage of the chatbot development process and recommend pattern-driven mitigations to evaluate the usefulness of the RAI pattern catalog in a real-world setting.","Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia; Westpac Banking Group, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia; Atlassian, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s Data61, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, VIC, Melbourne, Australia",Q.

Parallel Control for Nonzero-Sum Games With Completely Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics via Reinforcement Learning,"This article utilizes parallel control to investigate the problem of continuous-time (CT) nonzero-sum games (NZSGs) for completely unknown nonlinear systems via reinforcement learning (RL), and a parallel control-based NZSG (PNZSG) method is developed without reconstructing unknown dynamics or employing off-policy integral RL (IRL). First, novel dynamic control policies (DCPs) are developed for NZSGs by introducing controls into feedback, and an augmented system with augmented performance indices is constructed to derive the DCPs. Then, we theoretically analyze the effect of the DCPs on the control stability and performance indices, and the optimality of PNZSG is proven to be equivalent to the optimality of the original NZSGs. Subsequently, an IRL technique is employed to achieve the developed PNZSG method, and we show that no prior knowledge of the dynamics of NZSGs is needed to deploy the developed PNZSG method because of the augmented system and performance indices. Finally, numerical examples, including cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of a vehicular platoon, demonstrate the correctness of the developed PNZSG method.

Development of Ai-Based Posture Monitoring System to Assist Yoga Training,"In the modern era of remote fitness and wellness, maintaining correct posture during exercises and yoga practices is vital for maximizing the benefits and preventing injuries. However, monitoring one's posture can be challenging, often leading to improper form and reduced effectiveness. To address this issue, this project presents an innovative real-time posture monitoring system using computer vision and pose estimation techniques. The system employs the Mediapipe library to detect and analyze the user's body posture through a camera feed. It begins by capturing a reference posture from an image and calculating its landmark coordinates. These coordinates serve as the baseline for correct posture. As the user performs exercises in front of the camera, their live posture is continuously evaluated against the reference posture using Euclidean distance as a similarity metric. A crucial contribution of this project lies in its ability to provide immediate feedback to the user regarding their posture. The system visualizes landmarks on the user's body, highlighting correct and incorrect positions in distinct colors. If the similarity score between the live posture and the reference posture surpasses a certain threshold, the landmarks appear in green, indicating good posture. Conversely, red landmarks indicate discrepancies, prompting the user to adjust their form. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed system in real-time posture assessment. Users can actively observe their posture and make necessary adjustments, fostering improved exercise outcomes and reduced risk of injuries. By offering a convenient and immediate feedback mechanism, this project bridges the gap between remote fitness practices and professional guidance, ultimately promoting safer and more effective workout routines","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sona College of Technology, Salem, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sona College of Technology, Salem, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sona College of Technology, Salem, India",S.

Enhancing Pain Level Assessment in Post-Surgery Patients Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms,"Control performance decreases significantly in the presence of uncertainty in variable availability, measurement noise, or instrumentation failure. In cluttered environments such as the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), clinical measures are often influenced by noise and artifacts. An important component in post-operative treatment is the assessment and management of pain levels. However, reliable information is critical for clinically relevant results and improved patient outcomes. From a control engineering point of view, variables are often estimated and interpolated to allow a suitable flow of feedback information to control loops for the optimization of drug dosages. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a promising tool to augment pain level assessment. This study introduces and compares two AI-based approaches for predicting continuous Numerical Rating Scales (NRS) based on heart rate (HR) data. The first approach uses polynomial regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression, while the second employs an LSTM model. Notably, the AI prediction model, independent of traditional interpolation techniques, outperforms the approach relying on interpolation. The proposed AI-based method holds promise for continuous estimation and can serve as an estimator for model-based control.

The NAJEH Effect: How ChatGPT is Shaping the Future of Higher Education,"In the digital era, Artificial Intelligence is increasingly developing. In recent years, one of the promising development in this field is ChatGPT which has sparked considerable interest. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that allows people to interact with a computer in a more natural and conversational way. It offers students and educators personalized learning experiences Linked to ChatGPt open AI API. Therefore, we present in this paper a virtual tutor, named NAJEH, integrated into the student engagement portal and mobile application (MYU) and have access to the Student Information System (SIS) and Learning Management System (LMS) of the Honoris United Universities11https://honoris.net/, which includes 6 institutions in Tunisia. Around five thousand students from the Université Centrale had the learning experience with NAJEH. A survey was carried out in order to explore students satisfaction and acceptance of NAJEH. Thus, with a 76% response rate, results show that more than 80 % of students find this chatbot tutor very useful, easy and use it at least once a day. As perspective, we propose to investigate on the impact of these interactions on the students' academic performance and teaching efficiency. In fact, an in-depth study requires more data available over a longer period, even several years.","Research Groups on Intelligent Machines (ReGIM-Lab), Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieur de Sfax (ENIS), University of Sfax, IEEE Tunisia Section, Tunisia; Digital and Information department, Honoris-Tunisia HONORIS United Universities, Carthage, Tunisia; Faculé des Sciences de Sfax (FSS), Research Groups on Intelligent Machines (ReGIM-Lab), University of Sfax, IEEE Tunisia Section, Tunisia; Research Groups on Intelligent Machines (ReGIM-Lab), Institut Sup. d'Informatique et de Multimédia (ISIMS), University of Sfax, IEEE Tunisia Section, Tunisia",A.

WIP: Using Generative AI to Assist in Individual Performance Feedback for Engineering Student Teams,"Teamwork is a critical component of engineering education, established as both an ABET competency and recognized by engineers in the workforce as one of the essential skills to their work. As a result, team-based learning throughout engineering education has become increasingly popular, especially in first-year programs. Tools such as CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a web-based program used by instructors, help instructors form student teams based on predefined criteria, facilitate peer evaluations to assess individual contributions and performance, and gather general feedback on student teamwork experiences. Other instructors may collect peer feedback through other methods, such as submitted assignments. Theories in organizational psychology highlight the relationship between performance feedback, psychological safety, and conflict management. To purposefully help students develop essential teamwork skills, such as how to manage conflict and build inclusive, psychologically safe teams effectively, it is important that they receive individual performance feedback. However, negative, unfiltered feedback from peers may also escalate unhealthy team dynamics. Consequently, instructors can be hesitant to share peer evaluation scores and comments with students because students may not be comfortable sharing honest, authentic feedback with their peers. However, withholding this valuable formative feedback to students may come at the expense of their individual professional development, especially in devel-oping teamwork skills. Additionally, these project-based learning (PBL) courses tend to be large, and summarizing formative feedback for individual students based on peer evaluations can be time-consuming and perhaps unrealistic with increasing class sizes. To address this need, we present the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system to create individual performance summaries based on student peer responses. The authors present preliminary work from a pilot study that uses generative AI to produce individual performance summaries using CATME data from a first-year engineering course at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We share a sample output performance summary using a generative AI tool, GPT-4 specifically. Our initial findings indicate AI tools, such as GPT-4, can serve as a solution to provide more confidentiality in peer comments by effectively summarizing peer comments and producing individual performance feedback reviews. This study provides promising initial findings and recommendations on how AI can be leveraged to automate a student feedback process for instructors, allowing students to receive individual performance feedback while also providing an additional layer of confidentiality to support team dynamics and not compromise honest individual assessments.","Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA; Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA; Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA; Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA",S.

Cocoscan: AI-Powered Precision Diagnostics for Coconut Leaf Disease,"Coconut cultivation is essential in tropical areas, but diseases such as Leaf Spot, Leaf Blight, Grey Leaf Spot, Root Wilt, Stem Bleeding, and Basal Stem Rot can severely harm coconut trees. To reduce the effects of these illnesses and guarantee the highest possible crop yields, early disease detection is important. Conventional detection techniques, which depend on specialist knowledge and manual examination, are labor-intensive, prone to human error, and frequently out of reach for smallholder farmers. This research presents a web-based application that automatically detects and categories diseases of coconut leaves using deep learning, most especially the Inception V3 model. The number of epochs to guarantee comprehensive training, a batch size that strikes a compromise between training speed and memory consumption, and a learning rate optimised for efficient convergence are important model parameters. In order to accommodate the architecture of the model, the image input size is set at 299×299 pixels. Through the web interface, farmers and agricultural specialists can submit photos of coconut leaves. The Inception V3 model, which has been trained on a sizable dataset of both healthy and diseased leaves, analyses the photos and offers real-time feedback, including suggestions for treatment, early disease detection, and disease identification. The user-friendly design requires no specialized knowledge, allowing farmers to quickly receive accurate diagnoses and preventive measures, improving farm management. The system also integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide visual explanations of predictions, ensuring transparency and trust in the model's outputs.","Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, KIT-Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India; Dept. of Agricultural Entomology, Centre for Plant Protection Studies Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, KIT-Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India; Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, KIT-Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India; Dept of Computer Science and Engineering, KIT-Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India",S.

Fostering Agile IT Project Management and Interpersonal Skills Using AI-Enhanced Game-Based Learning,"This research-to-practice full paper showcases the integration of AI-enhanced game-based learning in an IT project management course, aimed at improving students' Agile project management skills. We provide a qualitative analysis of students' reflections on teamwork in the IT project management course, alongside standardized course feedback. Students collaborate in teams of 5–7 on self-selected topics, creating coarse prototypes. The analysis revealed key success factors in teamwork, including effective communication, apportionment of work, regular meetings, and high motivation. Barriers included poor time management, unproductive meetings, external obligations, and absenteeism. Course feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with students valuing the course structure, atmosphere, and lecturer. Suggestions for improvement focused on workload reduction. Then, from these 48 teamwork reflections, we identify requirements for developing an AI-enhanced game-based project simulation platform. The main goal of the platform is to enhance the Agile skills of the students. The course and prototype serve as valuable resources for educators and curriculum designers, with future work focusing on student evaluation and further AI integration.","Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; ds:UniVie, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; ds:UniVie, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria",D.

Data Integration and Transformation using Artificial Intelligence,"The process and functioning of data integration is termed as combining information from several sources to provide users with a coherent perspective. The fundamental idea behind data integration is to open up data and make it simpler for individuals and systems to access, utilize, and process. The process of converting data from one format to another, typically from that of a source system into that required by a destination system, is known as data transformation. Data transformation is a component of the majority of data integration and management processes, including data manipulation and data warehousing. Many organizations carry out data transformation and integration because they have requirements with respect to data usage that is important in every situation. This paper proposes an architecture that reduces manual work and abstracts the decisions to be made in the integration and transformation process. This approach can lower the risk of human error and result in significant financial savings for various organizations.

Integration of Hardware and Software for Battery Hardware-in-the-Loop Toward Battery Artificial Intelligence,"This article demonstrates a novel, compact-sized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system, and its verification using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) features in battery controls. Conventionally, a battery management system (BMS) involves algorithm development for battery modeling, estimation, and control. These tasks are typically validated by running the battery tester open-loop, i.e., the tester equipment executes the predefined experimental protocols line by line. Additional equipment is required to make the testing closed-loop, but the integration is typically not straightforward. To improve flexibility and accessibility for battery management, this work proposes a low-cost highly reliable closed-loop charger and discharger. We first focus on the electronic circuit design for battery testing systems to maximize the applied current accuracy and precision. After functional verification, we further investigate applications for closed-loop BMSs. In particular, we extend the proposed architecture into the learning-based control design, which is a feedback controller. We utilize reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to highlight the benefits of closed-loop controls. As an example, we compare this learning-based control strategy with a conventional battery charging control. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed experimental design is able to handle the learning-based controller and achieve a more reliable and safer charging protocol driven by AI.","Energy, Controls and Applications Laboratory (eCAL), University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Energy, Controls and Applications Laboratory (eCAL), University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA",S.

Hierarchy in Algorithm-Based Feedback to Patients Working With a Robotic Rehabilitation System: Toward User-Experience Optimization,"When robotic systems are developed for individualized training during rehabilitation, providing effective feedback to the users is essential. We aimed to create a rule-based set of guidelines for the desired hierarchy, timing, content, and modality of feedback such a system should provide to users, such that they receive the necessary feedback, at the relevant time, in a way that enhances their performance, and does not encumber it. We conducted four focus groups with 20 stroke clinicians. The clinicians described the guiding principles they use when giving feedback to patients, and noted different output should be provided to the patient versus the clinician by the rehabilitation system. They delineated a hierarchy for providing feedback during the exercise set: success on the task is the primary goal, and feedback should be given on this aspect first. Once success is achieved, feedback should be given on the quality of the movement. Only when the task is successfully completed, with no compensatory movements (i.e., high quality), feedback should be given on movement speed. Using a follow-up survey and the member-checking approach, it was revealed that this hierarchical structure applies to early stages in the rehabilitation process, and that quality of movement becomes paramount as the rehabilitation process progresses. The clinicians expressed their desire to receive a full report on the patient's performance in each exercise session, which is more comprehensive than the feedback provided to the patient in real time. We conclude with a set of guidelines for developing automated feedback for patient populations.","Department of Industrial and Management Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel; Recanati School for Community Health Professions, Department of Physical Therapy, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel; Department of Industrial Engineering and Management and the Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel; Department of Physical Therapy and the Zlotowski Center for Neuroscience, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel",D.

A Design For A Machine-Learning-Enabled Multi-Channel Messaging Framework for Financial Service Institutions,"Financial Services Institutions (FSIs) utilize multi-channel messaging systems (MCM) to integrate diverse consumer communications channels into a unified system for the benefit of their customers. However, the multi-channel service has an extra overhead coordinating channel selection to identify which channel is available to send messages to customers because of the disparate nature of the integrated channels. Machine learning can be used to determine channels for communication in a customer alert system used by financial services institutions (FSIs). This work offers a machine-learning-enabled channel selection and management method based on Tug Of War (TOW) algorithm. The framework proposed will be based on the TOW dynamics algorithm. TOW uses a modified learning technique based on addition and subtraction's reward/loss principle.

The adaptive learning mechanism serves to mitigate resource wastage and prevent system overload by dynamically adjusting task scheduling actions based on prevailing system conditions. To assess the efficacy of the DTSALA algorithm, we conducted simulations comparing its performance with that of other widely used task scheduling algorithms, such as Max-Min, Min-Min, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Hybrid Whale Genetic Algorithm (HWGA). The simulation results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of the DTSALA algorithm, showcasing improvements in load balancing rate, task execution time, and system resource utilization when compared to these algorithms. By achieving a heightened load balancing rate, the DTSALA algorithm ensures equitable distribution of tasks across available system resources, thereby optimizing resource utilization. Furthermore, it reduces task execution time through efficient allocation of tasks to appropriate resources, ultimately enhancing the overall system performance and user experience within the cloud computing environment.","School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China",H.

Towards Interpretable Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised Deep Neural Network Approach using Feedback Loop,"As telecom networks generate high-dimensional data, it becomes important to support large numbers of co-existing network attributes and to provide an interpretable and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) anomaly detection system. Most state-of-the-art techniques tackle the problem of detecting network anomalies with high precision but the models don’t provide an interpretable solution. This makes it hard for operators to adopt the given solutions. The proposed Cluster Characterized Autoencoder (CCA) architecture improves model interpretability by designing an end-to-end data driven AI-based framework. Candidate anomalies identified using the feature optimised Autoencoder and entropy based feature ranking are clustered in reconstruction error space using subspace clustering. This clustering is seen to separate true positives and false positives and how well this is done is evaluated using entropy and information gain. A two dimensional t-SNE representation of anomaly clusters is used as a graphical interface to the analysis and explanation of individual anomalies using SHAP values. The solution provided by this unsupervised approach helps the analyst in the categorisation, identification and feature explanation of anomalies providing faster root cause analysis. Therefore, our solution provides better support for the network domain analysts with an interpretable and explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) anomaly detection system. Experiments on a real-world telecom network dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.","Ericsson, Network Management Lab, Athlone, Ireland; Software Research Institute, Technological University of the Shannon; Midlands, Midwest, Athlone, Ireland; Ericsson, Network Management Lab, Athlone, Ireland; Ericsson, Network Management Lab, Athlone, Ireland; Software Research Institute, Technological University of the Shannon; Midlands, Midwest, Athlone, Ireland",A.

A Conversation-Driven Approach for Chatbot Management,"Managing and evolving a chatbot’s content is a laborious process and there is still a lack of standardization. In this context of standardization, the absence of a management process can lead to bad user experiences with a chatbot. This work proposes the Chatbot Management Process, a methodology for content management on chatbot systems. The proposed methodology is based on the experiences acquired with the development of Evatalk, the chatbot for the Brazilian Virtual School of Government. The focus of this methodology is to evolve the chatbot content through the analysis of user interactions, allowing a cyclic and human-supervised process. We divided the proposed methodology into three distinct phases, namely, manage, build, and analyze. Moreover, the proposed methodology presents a clear definition of the roles of the chatbot team. We validate the proposed methodology along with the creation of the Evatalk chatbot, whose amount of interactions was of 22,771 for the 1,698,957 enrolled attendees in the Brazillian Virtual School of Government in 2020. The application of the methodology on Evatalk’s chatbot brought positive results: we reduced the chatbot’s human hand-off rate from 44.43% to 30.16%, the chatbot’s knowledge base examples increased by 160% whilst maintaining a high percentage of confidence in its responses and keeping the user satisfaction collected in conversations stable.","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil; National School of Public Administration, Brasília, Brazil; Department 2 Lippstadt, Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Sciences, Hamm, Germany; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil",G.

Data-Driven Framework for Optimizing Internship Efficiency and Addressing Skills Mismatch in Malaysian Higher Education,"The persistent skills mismatch between higher education outcomes and labour market needs presents a significant challenge for graduate employability, particularly in fast-evolving sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. This paper introduces a data-driven internship framework designed to bridge this gap by optimising student placements, providing real-time feedback, and ensuring academic curricula remain aligned with labour market demands. The framework integrates three systems: the Student Industry Placement System (SIPS), which uses machine learning to match students with relevant internships; the Intern Learning Management System (ILMS), which tracks skill development through continuous feedback loops; and the Industry Profiling System (IPS), which leverages predictive analytics to provide real-time labour market insights. The framework was evaluated through a mixed-methods approach, incorporating pilot program data from five universities and 15 industry partners and simulated data based on historical internship trends. The SIPS algorithm achieved a placement accuracy of 89%, significantly improving over traditional methods (60-65%). 78% of students received continuous feedback through the ILMS, resulting in measurable improvements in technical skills (30% increase in coding proficiency) and problem-solving abilities (25% improvement). The IPS enabled universities to update 15% of their curricula in response to real-time labour market data, particularly in high-growth sectors such as AI and digital transformation. 68% of the students secured full-time employment within six months of graduation, with 65% in roles directly aligned with their internships. These findings demonstrate the framework's scalability and potential for reducing skills mismatch, making it a viable model for other emerging economies.","Faculty of Computing Meta Technology, University Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Perak, Malaysia; Faculty of Science and Mathematics, University Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Perak, Malaysia; Faculty of Computing Meta Technology, University Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Perak, Malaysia",A.

Large Language Models Enhanced Client Simulation and Feedback System for Insurance Advisors,"Traditionally, training insurance advisors to improve their sales skills has been challenging. This has often involved static methods such as script memorization and workshops, which lack personalization and fail to adequately replicate real-world client interactions. To address this issue, we developed an innovative training system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to create intelligent agents that simulate difficult client interactions and provide evaluative feedback. Our system comprises three agents: two that simulate difficult client scenarios in telephone and face-to-face settings, and one that functions as an evaluator, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement. We collected and annotated over 1,000 real sales interaction recordings to train these agents, creating a comprehensive dataset. The system was tested with 50 insurance advisors, resulting in significant improvements in sales success rates, client satisfaction scores, advisor confidence levels, and response times compared to traditional training methods. This study underscores the effectiveness of LLMs in providing personalized, realistic, and immediate training experiences, highlighting their potential to revolutionize training methodologies in the insurance industry.","Higher Vocational College, Chengdu Neusoft University, Chengdu, China; Higher Vocational College, Chengdu Neusoft University, Chengdu, China; Higher Vocational College, Chengdu Neusoft University, Chengdu, China; Higher Vocational College, Chengdu Neusoft University, Chengdu, China",X.

Network System of Systems Manager,"For several decades, the L3Harris Mission Networks organization has perfected the design, deployment, operations, and management of enterprise-level networks for safety-critical missions using a managed service framework. L3Harris has successfully constructed geographically large and technologically diverse Local Area Network (LAN)/Wide Area Network (WAN) solutions for State and Federal customers by selecting, optimizing, and integrating Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) products and services into an integrated or homogeneous solution meeting exacting performance requirements. These purpose-built network solutions ensure performance and resilience through tailored provisioning and the configuration of highly reliable (e.g., through adaptive redundancy) architectures, diverse service connections and equipment, ubiquitous bandwidth allocation and an unparalleled telecommunication provider governance by a centralized operational support system.Over this same period, there have been key advances in the networking industry which signal the need to evolve beyond our centralized managed services model. These advances include the rapid industry transition from a dedicated Time-division Multiple Access (TDMA)-based solution to multifunction IP-based networks with Quality of Service (QoS) support, the growing deployment of Software Defined Everything (SDE), AI-assisted advanced modeling and simulation, near-universal adoption of cloud-based Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), design patterns and deployment solutions with the increasing presence of wireless services such as 5G (both fixed and mobile), Long Term Evolution (LTE), Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).Within these evolving technologies, network management solutions can move from centralized to federated architectures with the promise of effortless scalability, dynamic adaptability, and seamless collaboration. A federated hierarchical architecture offers organizations a blueprint allowing coordinated management, interoperability of data, resources and processes across heterogeneous systems, locations, and organizational boundaries. To take maximum advantage of such an architecture, we believe there is an opportunity to streamline and optimize network designs through an implementation of a Network System of Systems Manager (NSoSM). The NSoSM is a centralized system used to ingest network telemetry data across one or more networks, process data via AI/ML algorithms, to make informed decisions to improve the delivery of prioritized customer data and improve the usability of mission critical customer applications.The federated architecture construct, consisting of loosely coupled constituent databases for sharing and data exchange, has evolved beyond its origin and the set of standards facilitating its integration. The use of an Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) [01], the International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 model [02], the Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association (MESA) Business to Manufacturing Markup Language (B2MML) [03], and message exchange models have improved integration and scalability, resulting in wide adoption in manufacturing environments.The adoption of a federated architecture in enterprise-level, mission critical networks present several challenges. The solution to these challenges can be addressed with three primary capabilities: 1) Integrated Situational Awareness; 2) Integration Gateway, and 3) AI Augmentation and Automated Orchestration, carrying independent value and, when fused together, achieve a NSoSM which autonomously supports a federated ecosystem:Integrated Situational Awareness. Adapting to the increasing volume of technological solutions, the need for highly customized service integrator solutions evolves from a centralized integration of disparate platforms to an enterprise orchestration of integrated System-of-Systems (SoS). This is achieved through creating a hyperconverged monitoring and data collection capability of system logs, synthetic network probes, streaming telemetry and real-time channel performance metrics collected by Fault Management Systems, Network Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics Systems, and Application Performance Monitoring systems. Integrating these COTS solutions, together with Situational Awareness, offer end-to-end (E2E) planning, fault analysis, and command and control (C2) of regulated network environments.Integration Gateway. Of critical importance in the NSoSM model is the need to create a homogeneous, clear user experience across a heterogeneous collection of federated systems. This involves the definition and harmonization of the exchanged data and the technologies used for sending and receiving the exchanged data with intelligent markers to incorporate customer and mission-defined, protections. This involves both the harmonization of data from dissimilar heterogeneous end-systems to a common operating picture and to convert it back to native system languages when suggested configurations are being recommended to optimize customer service performance.AI Augmentation and Automated Orchestration (AIA2O). This capability is comprised of three primary and sequential functions: Datasets, Frameworks and Procedure Validation for AIOps and Command and Control (C2) Orchestration. Data from the Integration Gateway is interpreted into logical threads where Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and models apply insight to optimizations required for an improved User Experience (UX), via autonomous orchestration, reducing and sometimes eliminating the human-in-the-loop delay not only reducing the decision chain but also reducing human error. Insights and procedures are validated in a digital twin representation followed by the orchestration of optimizations in a production environment.The Federal Aviation Administration’s publication of Initial Concept of Operations for an Info-Centric National Airspace System asserts that ""The integrated information environment, providing data services including data integration from various sources, allows federated actors to reconcile, contextualize, and share relevant information’’. Additionally, value is perceived by enabling ""multiple entities to provide a federated set of xTM services for flights operating within the same airspace"". Implementing and operating NSoSM capabilities, comprised of an integrated gateway, integrated situational awareness, and AI augmentation and automated orchestration are at the core of where mission critical, enterprise-level networks and SDE are evolving for State, Federal, and Department of Defense (DoD) organizations. L3Harris’ approach to the design of a NSoSM solution provides a limitless overlay adapting to emerging and evolving technologies, meanwhile reduce operating expenses (OpEx) via an ever-growing AI community, enabling independent systems to collectively deliver value that cannot be achieved independently.","L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Melbourn, Florida; L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Melbourn, Florida",J.

Practically Unbiased Pairwise Loss for Recommendation With Implicit Feedback,"Recommender systems have been widely employed on various online platforms to improve user experience. In these systems, recommendation models are often learned from the users’ historical behaviors that are automatically collected. Notably, recommender systems differ slightly from ordinary supervised learning tasks. In recommender systems, there is an exposure mechanism that decides which items could be presented to each specific user, which breaks the i.i.d assumption of supervised learning and brings biases into the recommendation models. In this paper, we focus on unbiased ranking loss weighted by inversed propensity scores (IPS), which are widely used in recommendations with implicit feedback labels. More specifically, we first highlight the fact that there is a gap between theory and practice in IPS-weighted unbiased loss. The existing pairwise loss could be theoretically unbiased by adopting an IPS weighting scheme. Unfortunately, the propensity scores are hard to estimate due to the inaccessibility of each user-item pair's true exposure status. In practical scenarios, we can only approximate the propensity scores. In this way, the theoretically unbiased loss would be still practically biased. To solve this problem, we first construct a theoretical framework to obtain a generalization upper bound of the current theoretically unbiased loss. The bound illustrates that we can ensure the theoretically unbiased loss's generalization ability if we lower its implementation loss and practical bias at the same time. To that aim, we suggest treating feedback label $Y_{ui}$Yui as a noisy proxy for exposure result $O_{ui}$Oui for each user-item pair $(u, i)$(u,i). Here we assume the noise rate meets the condition that $\hat{P}(O_{ui}=1, Y_{ui}\ne O_{ui}) < 1/2$P^(Oui=1,Yui≠Oui)<1/2. According to our analysis, this is a mild assumption that can be satisfied by many real-world applications. Based on this, we could train an accurate propensity model directly by leveraging a noise-resistant loss function. Then we could construct a practically unbiased recommendation model weighted by precise propensity scores. Lastly, experimental findings on public datasets demonstrate our suggested method's effectiveness.","School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory, School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",T.

LLM Intelligent Customer Service in Property Management Using a RAG Approach,"Traditional property management services often struggle with challenges such as long response times and difficulties in effectively addressing complex tenant issues. While Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, offer promising solutions, they are often limited by their lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant responses. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces an intelligent customer service system tailored for property management. The system integrates a customized LLM with the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed to provide accurate, context-aware, and personalized responses. By employing an intelligent agent to pull relevant data from a dedicated property management knowledge base, the system can engage tenants in real-time through an interactive interface, ensuring both efficiency and relevance in communication. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are employed to continuously improve the system’s performance. The architecture combines a fine-tuned LLM, a vector database for fast information retrieval, and a feedback loop that supports ongoing optimization. We anticipate that this approach will lead to greater tenant satisfaction, more personalized services, and enhanced operational efficiency.

Smart Garbage Separators: A Comparative Evaluation,"When we want machines to perform tedious and dangerous tasks for us, it becomes necessary to prepare them to efficiently emulate our smart thinking and learning. For instance, when a garbage separator has to separate different categories of material like human learning does, there is a need to make them to explore an innovative application of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of separation and selection. But before to start the process it is very important to perform a comparative study on existing methodologies [1]–[50] by avoiding duplication of existing work. Thus, in this paper we perform a comparative study on a large number of recent methods and we provide our overall evaluation. Then we proceed with one extra step by improving a low performing methodology to elevate its performance by showing to our team the collaborative work for better results. Thus, it is crucial for effective waste management to leverage RL algorithms to optimize the sorting process in real-time, adapting dynamically to changes in the waste stream. By integrating sensors and AI techniques the smart garbage separator behaves as an autonomous agent within its operational environment, making decisions to classify and direct waste into appropriate categories such as recyclables, organics, and landfill. The RL model employs a reward-based system where actions—defined as sorting decisions—are continuously refined based on feedback regarding sorting accuracy and processing speed. Using a combination of real-world data collection and simulated environments, we implement and compare traditional Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms to determine their efficacy in handling complex, high-dimensional state spaces typical of waste material characteristics. The results indicate significant improvements in sorting accuracy and operational efficiency, showcasing the potential of RL to transform waste management practices.","CART Center, WSU, OH, USA; CART Center, WSU, OH, USA; CART Center, WSU, OH, USA; CART Center, WSU, OH, USA; CART Center, WSU, OH, USA; CART Center, WSU, OH, USA",D.

Network Resource Optimization Allocation Algorithm Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"With the growth of emerging technologies such as software defined networks, network function virtualization, and fifth generation communication, while improving network flexibility and controllability, it has also brought unprecedented challenges to the efficient adaptation of network resources such as routing, computing, and storage. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can establish a trial reward feedback mechanism in a different way from traditional optimization algorithms, accumulate experience for learning, and thus achieve optimization goals. This paper proposes a DRL based network resource allocation algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems in network resource allocation. By combining deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to construct a neural network, energy efficiency is used as a reward and punishment value, historical data is saved in an experience pool, and the weight parameters of the network are trained using gradient descent method. The algorithm has the ability to autonomously allocate and make decisions, dynamically adjust channel and power allocation according to environmental conditions, and obtain a approximately optimal allocation strategy. The simulation results show that over against other resource allocation methods, the resource allocation method proposed in this paper can effectively improve system throughput, and has good channel adaptability and convergence.","Liaocheng Technician College Liaocheng, Shangdong, China",Y.

"Using Epidemic Modeling, Machine Learning and Control Feedback Strategy for Policy Management of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is one of the world’s most challenging pandemics, affecting people around the world to a great extent. Previous studies investigating the COVID-19 pandemic forecast have either lacked generalization and scalability or lacked surveillance data. City administrators have also often relied heavily on open-loop, belief-based decision-making, preventing them from identifying and enforcing timely policies. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analyses based on closed-loop decisions for COVID-19. Combining epidemiological theories with machine learning models gives this study a more accurate prediction of COVID-19’s growth, and suggests policies to regulate it. The Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (SIR) model was analyzed using a machine learning model to estimate the optimal constant parameters, which are the recovery and infection rates of the coupled nonlinear differential equations that govern the epidemic model. To modulate the optimized parameters that regulate pandemic suppression and mitigation, a systematically designed feedback-based strategy was implemented. We also used pulse width modulation to modify on-off signals in order to regulate policy enforcement according to established metrics, such as infection recovery ratios. It was possible to determine what type of policy should be implemented in the country, as well as how long it should be implemented. Using datasets from John Hopkins University for six countries, India, Iran, Italy, Germany, Japan, and the United States, we show that our 30-day prediction errors are almost less than 3%. Our model proposes a threshold mechanism for policy control that divides the policy implementation into seven states, for example, if Infection Recovery Ratio (IRR) >80, we suggest a complete lockdown, vs if 10¡IRR¡20, we suggest encouraging people to stay at home and organizations to work at 50% capacity. All countries which implemented a policy control strategy at an early stage were accurately predicted by our model. Furthermore, it was determined that the implementation of closed-loop strategies during a pandemic at different times effectively controlled the pandemic.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Jodhpur, India; Department of Computer Science, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A&M University Texarkana, Texarkana, TX, USA",K.

AI Can Help Instructors Help Students: An LLM-Supported Approach to Generating Customized Student Reflection Responses,"This innovative practice paper presents an LLM-supported technique to help instructors respond effectively to periodic students' reflections. Efficient communication between instructors and students is integral to supporting a productive learning environment. Recognizing the significance of understanding students' perceptions and challenges, we present the initial implementation of a system to help instructors analyze and respond to students' feedback promptly and effectively. This research is inspired by and extends prior works where instructors sent progress check emails to students, with some works finding that such communication increased students' motivation. To collect feedback, we administer regular student reflections throughout the semester that capture how students feel about the course and uncover the challenges they face. This regular feedback-gathering approach allows instructors to better track their students' progress and respond to comments throughout the semester to provide guidance. However, reading and responding to each reflection manually in the context of their overall learning experience can be time consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based automated approach that generates tailored, performance-contextualized responses to student reflections that can be used to guide first-contact interventions. The generated reflection responses (GRRs) address issues discussed in student reflections and provide advice, support, course information, and follow-up questions to the students. Additionally, they provide feedback to students based on their accomplishments and behavioral data within the learning management system (LMS), such as submission patterns. In this work, we discuss our method of generating responses based on students' reflections and their LMS behavior. We also present example scenarios of the proposed approach. Preliminary results indicate that this approach can help instructors facilitate positive educational interactions with students and that the participating students view the interventions favorably, fostering a constructive learning environment.

Intelligence-Based Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Optimization in Edge Computing-Enabled Vehicular Networks,"Intelligent transportation systems demand efficient resource allocation and task offloading to ensure low-latency, high-bandwidth vehicular services. The dynamic nature of vehicular environments, characterized by high mobility and extensive interactions among vehicles, necessitates considering time-varying statistical regularities, especially in scenarios with sharp variations. Despite the widespread use of traditional reinforcement learning for resource allocation, its limitations in generalization and interpretability are evident. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Intelligence-based Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm. This algorithm utilizes active inference to infer the real world and maintain an internal model by minimizing free energy. Enhancing the efficiency of active inference, we incorporate prior knowledge as macro guidance, ensuring more accurate and efficient training. By constructing an intelligence-based model, we eliminate the need for designing reward functions, aligning better with human thinking, and providing a method to reflect the learning, information transmission and intelligence accumulation processes. This approach also allows for quantifying intelligence to a certain extent. Considering the dynamic and uncertain nature of vehicular scenarios, we apply the IRL algorithm to environments with constantly changing parameters. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of IRL, significantly improving the generalization and interpretability of intelligent models in vehicular networks.","College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GZ), Hong Kong; State Key Laboratory of Wireless Mobile Communications, Beijing, China",Y.

Scaffolding Language Learning via Multi-modal Tutoring Systems with Pedagogical Instructions,"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that imitate human tutors and aim to provide immediate and customized instructions or feedback to learners have shown their effectiveness in education. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups. Moreover, we extend our evaluation framework from a manual to an automated approach, paving the way to benchmark various conversational tutoring systems.","Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Stanford University; Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR, Singapore",Z.

Addressing the Cold-Start Problem in Collaborative Filtering Through Positive-Unlabeled Learning and Multi-Target Prediction,"The cold-start problem is one of the main challenges in recommender systems and specifically in collaborative filtering methods. Such methods, albeit effective, typically can not handle new items or users that do not have any prior interaction activity in the system. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step approach to address the cold-start problem. First, we view the user-item interactions in a positive unlabeled (PU) learning setting and reconstruct the interaction matrix between users and warm items, detecting missing links and recommending warm items to existing users. Second, an inductive multi-target regressor is trained on this reconstructed interaction matrix and subsequently predicts interactions for new items that enter the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a two-step PU learning method is proposed to address the cold-start problem in recommender systems. To evaluate the proposed approach, we employed four benchmark datasets from movie and news recommendation domains with explicit and implicit feedback. We compared our method against three other competitor approaches that address the cold-start problem and showed that our proposed method significantly outperforms them, achieving in a case an increase of 16.9% in terms of NDCG.","Itec, IMEC Research Group, KU Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium; Department of Management, Strategy and Innovation, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Itec, IMEC Research Group, KU Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium",A.

Decoding Sentiments: An Efficient Trans-Long Short Term Memory to Understand Viewer Reactions on Ad-Supported Video Contents,"Viewer reaction analysis in ad-supported video content focuses on the use of advanced techniques to understand and interpret the emotional responses expressed by viewers during ad viewing experiences. This analysis goes beyond simple positive or negative sentiment and delves into the nuances of viewer reactions, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the emotional impact of ads. With this information, advertisers can make data-driven decisions to optimize their advertising strategies, create more engaging content, and ultimately enhance the viewer experience. One of the challenges in sentiment analysis for viewer reaction analysis is the inherent subjectivity and variability of human emotions. Emotions can be complex and subjective, making it difficult to accurately capture and interpret them solely based on text or viewer feedback. Different individuals may perceive and express emotions differently, adding another layer of complexity to the analysis process. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of advanced deep learning model refinement. Overcoming these challenges can provide valuable insights into viewer reactions, enabling advertisers and content creators to create more engaging and impactful ad-supported video content. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based sentiment analysis is introduced to analyze the viewer's reaction while watching the ad in the video content. Here, an efficient model named Trans-Long Short-Term Memory (Trans-LSTM) is developed to perform the sentiment analysis. The developed Trans-LSTM is helpful in supervising the emotional data in the online video content and identifying the popularity of the corresponding video. The suggested model effectively analyzes the reviewer’s actions while watching all types of video content. Finally, the experimental analysis is performed to find the effectiveness of the developed sentiment analysis model via various metrics.","Department of Computer Science, Software Development & Engineering in Content Discovery & AI, COMCAST, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, Sr. Principal Systems Engineer in C & RS Platform Services, DT Amtrak, USA",S.

A Control Framework for Adaptation of Training Task and Robotic Assistance for Promoting Motor Learning With an Upper Limb Rehabilitation Robot,"Robot-assisted rehabilitation has been a promising solution to improve motor learning of neurologically impaired patients. State-of-the-art control strategies are typically limited to the ignorance of heterogeneous motor capabilities of poststroke patients and therefore intervene suboptimally. In this article, we propose a control framework for robot-assisted motor learning, emphasizing the detection of human intention, generation of reference trajectories, and modification of robotic assistance. A real-time trajectory generation algorithm is presented to extract the high-level features in active arm movements using an adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO) and then integrate the movement rhythm with the minimum-jerk principle to generate an optimal reference trajectory, which synchronizes with the motion intention in the patient as well as the motion pattern in healthy humans. In addition, a subject-adaptive assistance modification algorithm is presented to model the patient’s residual motor capabilities employing spatially dependent radial basis function (RBF) networks and then combining the RBF-based feedforward controller with the impedance feedback controller to provide only necessary assistance while simultaneously regulating the maximum-tolerated error during trajectory tracking tasks.

CareBot: A Mental Health Chatbot,"The cognitive, behavioral, and emotional health of a person is referred to as their mental health. In the present, mental health has emerged as one of the most important yet neglected facets of a person’s entire well-being. Though mental health chatbots are up and coming, there is still a need for a cost-effective, reliable, and interactive system. Stress and anxiety are two of the few factors that damage mental health. A person with mental health issues may suffer negative outcomes if sufficient care is not provided. Nowadays, with advancements in technology, one can use a computer to foretell the start of such mental health issues. Despite the fact that numerous academics have examined a range of methods for predicting depression, they frequently depend solely on the use of facial expressions, which, because they are subtle and small, can alter the performance of the model. Therefore, using more elements like textual analysis and emotion detection can help increase accuracy. In this study, a method for predicting mental health status using facial expression and sentiment analysis results is introduced. Through emotion detection and text data characterising the user’s mood, the suggested system replicates a one-on-one conversation between the user and the chatbot. Emotional detection and textual analysis are two features that can help predict mental health states more accurately. The suggested chatbot uses cutting-edge technology to analyse the user’s mood using a variety of inputs and offer suggestions for managing the feeling.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Geethanjali College of Engineering and Technology, Hydrabad, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India",A.

Enhancing Movie Recommendation Systems through Demographic and Content-Based Filtering Using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity,"the need of data collection in recent years has piloted into a transformative era of information utilization. The recommendation systems represent a specialized type of information filtering mechanisms designed to improve the quality of search outcomes by suggesting items that are highly related to user queries or aligned with their historical interactions. This research uses demographic filtering for a recommending popular and well rated movies to users with similar demographic backgrounds irrespective of genre or other parameters. The methodology used in this paper computes pairwise similarity scores for all movies based on the parameter of descriptions and recommend movies to the users based on that similarity score. TF * IDF is used to calculate the relative frequency that is the importance of the words in description. It vectorizes the object to generate TDF-IDF matrix of plots of movies. Cosine similarity is applied to find similarities between each pair of movies. The above approach generates a matrix in which each column represents a movie and each column has a word from the overview vocabulary that appear in at least one document. This is practiced to decrease the value of words that occur frequently in plot description, and hence reduces their impact in calculating the final similarity score. Demographic and content-based filtering is used for recommendation in this paper, while demographic filtering provides a very fundamental method for recommendation and cannot be used practically, whereas content-based filtering is more advanced and powerful.","Computer Engineering, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineeringdept, SVKM's NMIMS, Mumbai, India; Computer Engineering, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineeringdept, SVKM's NMIMS, Mumbai, India",S.

Parallel Learning-Based Steering Control for Autonomous Driving,"Steering control for autonomous vehicles at high speeds is challenging due to the highly nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The traditional model-based controllers usually degrade significantly in this case. With the development of artificial intelligence, learning-based control methods are emerging as promising alternatives. These methods require a tremendous amount of training data to achieve acceptable performances. However, the data collection process is costly or inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a parallel learning-based steering control method. Specifically, we first build a neural network (NN) based trajectory generative model (GeneratingNN) based on limited steering-trajectory raw data. The GeneratingNN can efficiently generate sufficient steering-trajectory data by enumerating the allowable steering actions sequences. Then, based on the raw data and generated data, we train another NN (RecallingNN) to learn the inverse mapping relationship between steering actions and trajectories. Hence, the RecallingNN can efficiently recall appropriate steering actions once given the previewed trajectory points. In addition, to further enhance the control accuracy and robustness, we use a simple feedback controller to handle the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. Testing results validate that the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy, stability and computational efficiency.","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Department of Automation, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",F.

Person Reidentification Based on Adaptive Relation Attention Network in Intelligent Monitoring System for the IoB,"The Internet of Behavior (IoB), which combines Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, plays an important role in building smart city. As a significant part of data collection and analysis, intelligent monitoring system needs robust algorithms for analyzing data to make corresponding feedback. The development of person reidentification (re-id) has benefited from deep learning methods, especially for the IoB application. However, most existing person re-id methods under intelligent monitoring cannot solve some problems in the real world, such as occlusion and background cluster. In this article, we propose an adaptive relation attention (ARA) network for person re-id based on the ARA mechanism, which can address the abovementioned challenges effectively. The ARA module consists of relation branch and adaption branch. Relation branch captures the global structural information by mining relation among feature nodes. Adaption branch generates dynamic weights for attention features that relation branch produced. Our constructed intelligent IoB system can acquire the behavior status of pedestrian at different times and places, providing corresponding feedback rapidly. Data transmission and storage in our system are built in a decentralized way, which is based on blockchain. Our person re-id method outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on the CUHK03, Market-1501, and DukeMTMC-reID, showing excellent robustness.","School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China; School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China; Global Big Data Technologies Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia",T.

Novel Vote Scheme for Decision-Making Feedback Based on Blockchain in Internet of Vehicles,"Obtaining timely and accurate traffic information is one of the most important problems in intelligent transportation system, which will make vehicles run smoothly, avoid road congestion, save road running time and reduce vehicle energy consumption. In the current Internet of Vehicles system, the traffic management center can learn from the feedback information of all vehicles to improve the ability of decision-making and traffic command. However, the existing feedback mechanism does not respond to the spatial-temporal characteristics of data in time, due to the lack of communication capability of the current equipment. So, it cannot meet the requirements of ultra-low delay, high reliability and high security in the Internet of Vehicles. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based proxy vote and revocation scheme for decision feedback in Internet of Vehicles, which allows the intelligent system to ignore the unevenness and heterogeneity in the 6G technology. In addition, blockchain technology notarizes the vote data of vehicles and outsources microservices. Secondly, we use the attributes of decision-related nodes instead of their identities to enable anonymous vote. Smart contracts can automatically expand the scalability of outsourced microservices. Finally, the security proof of the proposed scheme ensures the security and consistency of outsourced microservices. The simulation results also show that our scheme greatly improves the efficiency of voting feedback.","School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China; Department of Computing Science, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K.; Department of EECS, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA",Y.

Bootstrapping serious games to assess learning through analytics,"Serious games have several advantages for learning over more traditional activities. One of those advantages is that being highly interactive, they provide a firsthand simulated experience to the users. Serious games can also generate interaction data that can be used to assess learning, both for evaluation and to provide timely feedback for learners or even adapt aspects of the game on the fly. However, this potential is currently far from realized because doing so requires significant investment and expertise as compared to more traditional educational activities. Additionally, game learning analytics continue to be a costly and fragile process. We propose a combination of tools that greatly reduces the associated costs of building serious games with meaningful analytics simplifying the validation of those games and their deployment in real settings. We consider that this can be a key step to building predictive assessment avoiding the need for disruptive external assessment thus bootstrapping serious games to recognize learning through analytics.","Dept. of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Dept. of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Dept. of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Dept. of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain",M.

MARL-Based Cooperative Multi-AGV Control in Warehouse Systems,"Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are essential components for the automation of fulfillment centers, a type of warehouse, where goods are stored on shelves and carried by AGVs. To increase the productivity in inventory management, a well-organized cooperative path control is required to transport goods to the designated picking stations. In this paper, we propose a QMIX-based scheme for the cooperative path control of multiple AGVs. Although QMIX is the one of popular cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, we find that QMIX alone was not enough to increase productivity in warehouse systems. So, we develop two novel techniques that can be used with QMIX: 1) sequential action masking that eliminates all the collision cases and 2) additional local loss that improves collaboration of individual AGVs. They help to encourage the AGVs to cooperate more for high productivity. By extensive simulations, we present the superiority of the proposed scheme on several layouts in fulfillment centers. The effect of cooperation among AGVs in the proposed scheme is verified through the comparison study with the existing algorithms. Additionally, we show the generalization performance by investigating the reusability of the model trained with the proposed scheme.","Future Convergence Engineering, Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheonan, South Korea; Future Convergence Engineering, Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheonan, South Korea; Future Convergence Engineering, Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheonan, South Korea; Department of Knowledge-Converged Super Brain Convergence Research, ETRI, Daejeon, South Korea; Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence Education, Korea National University of Education, Cheongju, South Korea",H. -B.

"ChatGPT: Fundamentals, Applications and Social Impacts","Recent progress in large language models has pushed the boundaries of natural language processing, setting new standards for performance. It is remarkable how artificial intelligence can mimic human behavior and writing style in such a convincing way. As a result, it is hard to tell if a human or a machine wrote something. Deep learning and natural language processing have recently advanced large language models. These newer models can learn from large amounts of data to better capture the nuances of language, making them more accurate and robust than ever before.

WearROBOT: An Energy Conservative Wearable Obstacle Detection Robot With LP Multi-Commodity Graph,"Human activity wearable obstacle detection for the visually impaired (VI) was developed for routine monitoring and observation of surrounding events. Environmental observation, home surveillance, and assistive supports are now built on wearable devices using inertia-based sensors, such as accelerometers, linear acceleration, and gyroscopes. However, previous assisted living system (ALS) still faces challenges in energy management and resource allocation when performing daily activities, particularly with ambulation. Legacy systems cannot fully improve self-esteem, hence, WearROBOT, which detects rearview obstacles and has an audio feedback system incorporated for voicing out once an obstacle is detected. Linear programing (LP) multi-commodity graph (LMCG) learning model is proposed while coupling the shortest path resource allocation for space diversity linearization. An Infrared sensor problem function that minimizes link utilization is derived. Angle-Intensity analysis (AIA) was carried out on various use case scenarios to enable the user to know the best angle to consider depending on its usage and battery conservation. This work showed how intensity differs at various angles of 5°, 15°, 20°, 35°, and 45°. Also, the reflectivity of different materials and how it affects the battery life are studied. As the wearable robot moves away from the node-obstacle, the LMCG narrow-band sensor node (LMCG-NB-IoT) drops energy significantly. The Low Power WAN (LP-WAN), Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and proposed LMCG-NB-IoT offered 51.28%, 33.33%, and 15.39% respectively. In terms of energy latency, the schemes gave 65.63%, 31.25%, and 3.12% respectively. Similarly, the proposed LMCG-NB-IoT had a 50% battery life profile.

ExAIS: Executable AI Semantics,"Neural networks can be regarded as a new programming paradigm, i.e., instead of building ever-more complex programs through (often informal) logical reasoning in the programmers' mind, complex ‘AI’ systems are built by optimising generic neural network models with big data. In this new paradigm, AI frameworks such as Ten-sorFlow and PyTorch play a key role, which is as essential as the compiler for traditional programs. It is known that the lack of a proper semantics for programming languages (such as C), i.e., a correctness specification for compilers, has contributed to many problematic program behaviours and security issues. While it is in general hard to have a correctness specification for compilers due to the high complexity of programming languages and their rapid evolution, we have a unique opportunity to do it right this time for neural networks (which have a limited set of functions, and most of them have stable semantics). In this work, we report our effort on providing a correctness specification of neural net-work frameworks such as TensorFlow. We specify the semantics of almost all TensorFlow layers in the logical programming language Prolog. We demonstrate the usefulness of the semantics through two applications. One is a fuzzing engine for TensorFlow, which features a strong oracle and a systematic way of generating valid neural networks. The other is a model validation approach which enables consistent bug reporting for TensorFlow models.","Singapore Management University, Singapore; Singapore Management University, Singapore",R.

A Cross Q-Learning Assisted Resource Allocation for User-Centric Optical Wireless Communication Networks,"The user-centric (UC) association in optical wireless communication (OWC) forms amorphous cells (A-Cells) by considering the dynamic distribution and load demand of user equipments (UEs). This philosophy offers advantages over the conventional network-centric (NC) association that purely relies on a pre-defined and fixed network configuration, in terms of alleviating undesired inter-cell interference (ICI) and achieving superior system performance. However, constructing the optimal A-Cells for a given OWC network, including determining the appropriate number of A-Cells associated to their contained UEs, is deeply integrated with the UEs’ distribution and transmission conditions. To address the intractable issue, in this paper, we conceive an adaptive UC-OWC network that relies on a feedback-guided iterative framework, which is capable of jointly optimizing A-Cells formation, modulation-mode assignment and power allocation strategies. For the sake of attaining the optimized throughput of this adaptive network, we initialize the UC association by the designed k-means based genetic algorithm (KGA), which can then be iteratively adjusted based on the throughput feedback obtained via our proposed multi-user cross Q-learning (MUCQ) resource allocation algorithm. Simulation results indicate that, compared to conventional counterparts, our adaptive UC-OWC network is able to significantly improve throughput performance and reduce outage probability.","Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Key Laboratory of Dynamic Cognitive System of Electromagnetic Spectrum Space, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China",S.

Secure Containment Control for Multi-UAV Systems by Fixed-Time Convergent Reinforcement Learning,"This article concerns the secure containment control problem for multiple autonomous aerial vehicles. The cyber attacker can manipulate control commands, resulting in containment failure in the position loop. Within a zero-sum graphical game framework, secure containment controllers and malicious attackers are regarded as game players, and the attack-defense process is recast as a min-max optimization problem. Acquiring optimal distributed secure control policies requires solving the game-related Hamilton-Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Based on the critic-only neural network (NN) structure, the reinforcement learning (RL) method is employed in solving coupled HJI equations. The fixed-time convergence technique is introduced to improve the convergence rate of RL, and the experience replay mechanism is utilized to relax the persistence of excitation condition. The associated NN convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed. In the attitude loop, the optimal feedback control law is obtained by solving Hamilton-Jacobi–Bellman equations using the fixed-time convergent RL method.

"Design of an Integrated Model Combining CycleGAN, PPO, and Vision Transformer for Adaptive Scene Rendering in the Metaverse","The emergence of the metaverse demands adaptive rendering systems that produce high-quality scenes, balancing the dimensions of visual fidelity with computational efficiency. Methods used for scene generation and rendering usually fail to incorporate user interactions in real time, leading to resource inefficiency and reduced user experience. This paper proposes a new, all-in-one model that integrates CycleGAN, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Vision Transformer (ViT), Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), and Adaptive Feedback Learning (AFL-RT) in an attempt at dynamic optimization of the scene rendering based on user behavior and environmental data. The CycleGAN module ensures the production of the high-resolution scenes even from low-resolution inputs, whereas PPO provides for continuous adaptation of rendering parameters so as to reduce latency and computational load. ViT uses attention-based rendering, providing better visualization to user-centric areas, and BYOL does self-supervised scene understanding and compression, maintaining important information though reducing the bandwidth usage. AFL-RT is actually a closed-loop feedback system used to refine rendering parameters in real-time by actually reflecting the user’s preference and interests. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model reduces latency by as much as 30% in rendering, improves visual fidelity by up to 15%, and decreases energy consumption by 25% compared with the baseline methods. The user satisfaction also increases up to 25% regarding real-time adaptations by using this model, which only validates the practicality of such a model for dynamic, interactive metaverse environments. This work offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges of adaptive scene rendering, thus highly applicable to future metaverse applications in almost all industries and scenarios.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering-AI&ML, DRK Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; School of Computer Science and Engineering, VIT-AP University, Amaravathi, India; School of Computer Science and Engineering, VIT-AP University, Amaravathi, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, CMR Technical Campus, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; Department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, RVR & JC College of Engineering, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dayananda Sagar University, Bengaluru, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, St. Peter’s Engineering College, Hyderabad, Telangana, India",D.

Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in LEO Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks With System State Delay,"Computing offloading optimization for energy saving is becoming increasingly important in low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) since battery techniques have not kept up with the demand of ground terminal devices.

Additionally, we develop a multi-level feedback queue for computing allocation (RAMLFQ), which can effectively enhance the CPU’s efficiency in task scheduling. We initially formulate the computation offloading problem with the system delay as Delay Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs), and then transform them into the equivalent standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). To solve the optimization problem effectively, we employ a double deep Q-network (DDQN) method, enhancing it with an augmented state space to better handle the unique challenges posed by system delays. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based computing offloading algorithm achieves high levels of performance efficiency and attains a lower total cost compared to other existing offloading methods.","School of Electronic Science and Engineering (School of Microelectronics), South China Normal University, Foshan, China; School of Electronic Science and Engineering (School of Microelectronics), South China Normal University, Foshan, China; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China; College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Machine Learning Department, Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE",B.

A Fuzzy Logic and NLP Approach to Emotion Driven Response Generation for Voice Interaction,"The voice modality has become the most prominent channel in the rapidly emerging field of human-computer interactions. Emotional connection is the foundation of successful communication. Our words are enhanced in human-to-human interactions by emotional undertones, vocal specifics, and contextual interpretations. When correctly interpreted, these hidden signals open the door to empathy, understanding, and effective communication. However, this emotional depth is not addressed in human computer verbal interactions. The challenge is comparable to having a conversation in which the words are understood but the feelings are not. Our idea focuses on bridging this emotional divide. We introduce an innovative approach to human-computer vocal interactions using a blend of advanced Natural Language Processing and Fuzzy Logic-based Voice Sentiment Analysis. Because human emotions are naturally complex, we use fuzzy logic to extract nuanced sentiment scores from voice inputs. Both the content, which is obtained from NLP, and the tone, which is modified to either mirror or contradict the detected sentiment, are informed by these evaluations in the form of voice. This bonds people with AI not only through words but also through emotions. Such a system has broad applications, from emotionally intelligent virtual assistants to support lines and teletherapy solutions. By ensuring AI can not only understand but also respond aptly to human emotion, bringing AI one step closer to reality.","Computer Science and Business Systems R.M.K.

Enhancing Intercropping Yield Predictability Using Optimally Driven Feedback Neural Network and Loss Functions,"Enhancing the crop yield predictability in intercropping systems is important for optimizing agricultural productivity. However, accurately predicting yield in such systems is quite challenging due to complex interactions between crops. This study introduces an advanced methodology using integrated loss functions within an optimally driven Feedback Neural Network (FNN) approach to improve yield prediction in a pea-cucumber intercropping systems. Traditional models relying only on Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function often unable to capture the complexity of models, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, the advanced loss functions are introduced like Dynamic Margin Loss (DML), Risk-Adjusted Loss (RAL), Quantile Loss (QL), and Hybrid Agronomic Efficiency Loss (HAEL) along with three optimizers such as Adaptive Momentum (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and Adaptive delta (Adadelta). These loss functions incorporate risk, uncertainty, and agronomic efficiency into the model training process, enhances predictive capabilities and robustness. This proposed framework is able to capture the complexity of yield prediction by incorporating agricultural factors. While Gradient Boost Machines (GBM) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have some potential, they are not able to capture these dynamics. The sensitivity and weight analysis also focuses that HAEL targets important agronomic factors such as nitrogen uptake and residue biomass, which provide a holistic view of yield prediction. The proposed approach improves the predictive performance compared to traditional models and helps to identify the importance of features, which makes it an effective tool for decision making in sustainable agriculture. Selecting appropriate loss functions is essential to improve the accuracy and robustness of crops yield prediction models. Thus, study provides a strong foundation for enhancing yield prediction in intricate intercropping systems, which all significantly enhance the advancement of precision agriculture.","Department of Computer Science and IT, Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur, Pakistan; Department of Information Security, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan",A.

LLM-enabled Intent-driven Service Configuration for Next Generation Networks,"Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is a promising paradigm for next generation networks, enabling automated network management based on user-defined business network requirements (Intents). However, current IBN approaches consider that users require expertise in some formal and technical models (e.g., Network Service Descriptors - NSDs) to define these Intents, necessitating substantial effort. A natural progression of IBN systems is to define Intents using natural language instead of structured models. However, dealing with this becomes challenging due to the unstructured and ambiguous nature of natural language. Fortunately, Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very powerful in understanding human language, making them well-suited for this task. This paper proposes an LLM-based Intent translation system that allows users to express Intents in natural language, which the system subsequently converts into NSDs. Moreover, we employ a Human Feedback (HF) loop that enables the system to learn from past experiences. Evaluations conducted at the EURECOM 5G facility [1] confirm the effectiveness of our approach in generating accurate NSDs suitable for deployment on an edge computing cluster.","EURECOM, France; EURECOM, France",A.

Decentralized User Allocation and Dynamic Service for Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC System,"With the promising techniques and mobile applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm has been widely utilized to support the massive data processing and meet the computation demand of mobile devices. However, the service coverage is limited by the static servers. Therefore, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility are deployed as aerial base stations (BS) to assist ground users to offload the task and process the data on edge. In this article, we introduce a decentralized user allocation and dynamic service scheme to assign the UAV deployment for a multi-UAV MEC system, which incorporates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology into a two-layer training framework. The continuous action, including the UAV trajectory and bit allocation of offloading, is first optimized in the lower layer, while the upper one concentrates on the discrete action space for the user allocation. In particular, we develop a constraint reward function that considers the communication quality in the lower layer to accomplish efficient communication.

An Automated Compliance Framework for Critical Infrastructure Security Through Artificial Intelligence,"Current data on cybercrime shows a rising influence of online threats, leading to significant financial impacts across vital industries like finance, healthcare, and energy. These impacts encompass the theft of confidential information, service interruptions, and expenses tied to breach remediation, underscoring the urgent necessity for strengthened cybersecurity strategies. Machine learning (ML) is highly effective in signifying cybersecurity standards, leveraging large-scale data analysis, pattern recognition, and adaptability to emerging threats. Unlike other traditional methods such as rule-based that relay on predefined criteria. This study presents an automated ML framework to recommend cybersecurity standards, audits, and compliance measures, enhancing and monitoring cybersecurity infrastructure systematically. Nine cybersecurity standards, including seven international (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001:2022, NIST, CIS) and two national standards (UAE, KSA), were analyzed using data from official sources. Data preprocessing addressed duplicates and missing values, with validation via Pearson Correlation and Chi-square tests (Chi-square = 55.79, p = 0.0017). Attributes were extracted using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique and refined through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). A content-based filtering (CBF) recommender system, aligned with organizational maturity levels, was developed and enhanced with a feedback loop for user insights. The recommendation model was validated across three organizational growth scenarios: ad-hoc, managed, and adaptive. The UAE standard recommended 158 controls for Scenario-1, while KSA led in Scenario-2. We evaluate the performance of the model using 3-ML classifiers including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Model performance was assessed using the F1 score and ROC AUC score. Testing in ad-hoc, managed, and adaptive scenarios showed the UAE standard recommended 158 controls for Scenario-1, while KSA led Scenario-2. The RF classifier achieved 81% accuracy and an ROC AUC score of 0.98. This framework supports alignment with global standards, enhances cybersecurity governance, and enables ongoing cybersecurity maturity tracking, aiding resilience and improving GCI rankings.","National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Riphah Institute of Systems Engineering (RISE), Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan; Higher Colleges of Technology, Dubai, United Arab Emirates",S.

Representation Learning for Wafer Pattern Recognition in Semiconductor Manufacturing Process,"The Demand for low-power and high-performance semiconductors has rapidly increased. To improve the competitiveness of system semiconductor companies, an efficient defect management process through Automatic Defect Classification (ADC) is essential. However, as semiconductor patterns are miniaturized, defects are becoming very small. It is becoming increasingly difficult for scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipment to accurately find defects. In addition, a lot of costs is required for image collection, learning, and classification to increase defect detection accuracy. In this study, we proposed a novel volumetric representation learning to perform 3D wafer handling in the Wafer Pattern Recognition (WPR) framework. The proposed method generates a 3D representation using a structure generator and pseudo-rendering and then performs appropriate pattern recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the 3D representation shows competitive performance compared to the existing model with a performance difference of 2% to 22% based on the F-score compared to the 2D image. Also, in terms of the same cost, it is expected that it will lead to better performance if we can overcome the limitations of 2D and consider the increase in cost for 3D models. Consequently, it gives feedback to the ADC, and higher productivity in semiconductor products is expected.","Department of Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea",S.

Deep Learning for Coverage-Guided Fuzzing: How Far are We?,"Fuzzing is a widely-used software vulnerability discovery technology, many of which are optimized using coverage-feedback. Recently, some techniques propose to train deep learning (DL) models to predict the branch coverage of an arbitrary input owing to its always-available gradients etc. as a guide. Those techniques have proved their success in improving coverage and discovering bugs under different experimental settings. However, DL models, usually as a magic black-box, are notoriously lack of explanation. Moreover, their performance can be sensitive to the collected runtime coverage information for training, indicating potentially unstable performance. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on 4 types of DL models across 6 projects to (1) revisit the performance of DL models on predicting branch coverage (2) demystify what specific knowledge do the models exactly learn, (3) study the scenarios where the DL models can outperform and underperform the traditional fuzzers, and (4) gain insight into the challenges of applying DL models on fuzzing. Our empirical results reveal that existing DL-based fuzzers do not perform well as expected, which is largely affected by the dependencies between branches, unbalanced sample distribution, and the limited model expressiveness. In addition, the estimated gradient information tends to be less helpful in our experiments. Finally, we further pinpoint the research directions based on our summarized challenges.","College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore",S.

Autonomous Human and Animal Classification Using Synthetic 2D Tensor Data Based on Dual-Receiver mmWave Radar System,"Human and animal classification under the rubble is necessary to successfully rescue survivors post-disaster, and interference from other animals is becoming an issue in noncontact monitoring with radar. Many animals in indoor and outdoor environments have characteristics similar to humans, where they are easily mistaken for human targets, which would trigger a false alarm. A novel human and animal classification through single-receiver and dual-receiver mmWave radar at 77 GHz is presented. The system uses feedback signal responses from targets with dual-receiver mmWave radar and classifies human and animal features using a convolution neural network (CNN) based on synthetic 2D Tensor data.

Digital Twin Evolution for Hard-to-Follow Aeronautical Ad-Hoc Networks in Beyond 5G,"The aircrafts were top of the places that disrupted the seamless connectivity requirement of 5G and beyond. The Aeronautical Ad-hoc Networks (AANETs) take the attention of both industry and academia to satisfy this connectivity requirement with the low cost, easy deployment, and continuous coverage features. On the other hand, the ultra-dynamic characteristics of AANET with unstructured topology make its environment hard-to-follow. Here, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodologies have an essential role in handling the management complexity of this hard-to-follow environment. However, these methodologies increase the computational complexity of aircraft due to the continuous update, convergence time, and scalability issues. At that point, we propose the utilization of the Digital Twin (DT) technology to handle the management complexity of AANET while solving the main issues of AI-based methodologies on it. The DT can virtually replicate the physical AANET components through closed-loop feedback in real-time. Therefore, this work introduces the utilization of DT technology for the AANET orchestration and, accordingly, proposes a DT-enabled AANET (DT-AANET) topology management framework. This framework consists of the Physical AANET Twin and Controller, including Digital AANET Twin with Operational Module. Here, the Digital AANET Twin virtually represents the physical environment while the operational module executes the AI-based computations on them through unsupervised learning-based training or supervised learning-based prediction.

Toward Generalizable Robotic Dual-Arm Flipping Manipulation,"Robotic dual-arm manipulation often requires close cooperation between the arms. Dual-arm manipulation tasks are always difficult to program in advance, and then, executed autonomously by the robots. Learning from demonstration is an efficient programming method for robots that can transfer human skills to robots. However, conventional skill learning methods, e.g., dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) can only characterize the motion information of each dimension independently, and cannot take into account the relationship between multidimensional information. Participially, flipping manipulation is quite common in industry production lines, but it has not been well addressed yet to provide a robotics solution to this task. In this article, we propose an improved DMP model, called the object-level constrained DMP, which effectively preserves the association between multidimensional information. Similarly, we also propose an orientation generalization method for the flipping task. In addition, we show how to demonstrate the flipping task via a teleoperation system.

MARVEL: Bringing Multi-Agent Reinforcement- Learning Based Variable Speed Limit Controllers Closer to Deployment,"Variable Speed Limit (VSL) is a promising highway traffic management strategy deployed worldwide. Most algorithms deployed operate based on a set of predefined rules which hinders their ability to perform optimally across diverse traffic conditions. Recent studies applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to VSL control problems have shown promising results. However, none of the existing MARL frameworks comply with real-world requirements imposed by most traffic agencies across the United States. In this work, we propose MARVEL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement-learning for large-scale Variable spEed Limits), a novel MARL framework for large-scale VSL highway control with real-world deployment capabilities. MARVEL only relies on sensing information available in most real-world settings and learns through a reward structure that incorporates three abstract goals to ensure reasonable behaviors under different traffic conditions. Through parameter sharing among all VSL agents, the proposed framework scales to cover corridors equipped with multiple VSL gantries. The policies are trained in a microscopic traffic simulation environment, focusing on a short freeway stretch with 8 VSL agents spanning 7 miles. For testing, these policies are applied to a more extensive network with 34 VSL agents spanning 17 miles of Interstate 24 (I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee, the United States. MARVEL improves traffic safety by 63.4% compared to the no-control scenario and enhances traffic mobility by 58.6% compared to a state-of-the-practice algorithm that has been deployed on I-24.

Furthermore, given the scale of such networks and the large number of services they offer, SD-WANs do not limit the attacker’s access to publicly accessible information that can lead to successful coordinated attacks.In this white paper, we introduce a game-based theoretic approach that operates on open-source intelligence-based information gathering to model potential attack scenarios and drive a proactive moving target defense technique to prevent potential exploitation of SD-WANs. Initial qualitative investigations showed that the proposed approach can help reduce the potential attack success rates.","Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt; Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, VA, USA; Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt; Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt",R.

New Optimized Adaptive Time Series IDS Classifier Algorithm: Beyond Deep Learning,"Adaptive time series Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Classifier is essential to detect real-time cyber-threats. Meanwhile, optimized hyperparameters on time series IDS classifier model will ensure swift detection. However, current studies on Time Series IDS classifier involve additional RNN-LSTM layers and multiple gates to optimize the training and feedback process. Notwithstanding, RNN-LSTM has powerful features to memorize data sequences. The nature of multiple complex hidden states in RNN-type model requires intensive training or epoch to achieve optimized loss function. This paper aims to go beyond conventional deep learning model by removing complex gated states and conventional hidden layers. The goal is to create an optimized adaptive time series classifier. The model leverages various fitting algorithms which include Sinusoidal, Linear, Power Function, Taylor Series and a new “Staircase” function that is introduced in this study. These functions adapt gradually to the real-time target distribution pattern. This will eliminate the need for feedback process to optimize hyperparameters. The model’s performance is evaluated against the realistic benchmarked IDS dataset; a dataset that simulates recent malware attacks and has imbalanced distribution property. This property reflects a realistic low cyber-attack footprint. After 10 epoch over randomized stratified testing samples, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) rate achieved almost 0.0% after a fitting process reached 100% as compared with the conventional LSTM model that achieved 17%.","Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Tapah, Perak, Malaysia; Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Tapah, Perak, Malaysia; Management Information System Department, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Department of Computer and Network Engineering, College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Information Systems and Technology Department, College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",S.

Learning-based Six-axis Force/Torque Estimation Using GelStereo Fingertip Visuotactile Sensing,"Visuotactile sensors have recently attracted much attention in robot communities due to the benefit of high spatial resolution sensing. However, force/torque estimation by visuotactile sensors remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a learning-based six-axis force/torque estimation network using GelStereo visuotactile sensor, which can provide two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) displacements of markers embedded in the sensor surface. The convolutional neural networks are employed to extract multi-modal tactile deformation features; and a novel contact positional encoding method is proposed to eliminate the influence of translation invariance in convolutional operators. The well-trained model achieves the best RMSE of 0.290 N in force and 0.0084 Nm in torque. Furthermore, the proposed force/torque estimation network is integrated with a force-feedback policy for adaptive grasping tasks.

DiffNet++: A Neural Influence and Interest Diffusion Network for Social Recommendation,"Social recommendation has emerged to leverage social connections among users for predicting users’ unknown preferences, which could alleviate the data sparsity issue in collaborative filtering based recommendation. Early approaches relied on utilizing each user’s first-order social neighbors’ interests for better user modeling, and failed to model the social influence diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we propose a preliminary work of a neural influence Diffusion Network (i.e., DiffNet) for social recommendation L. Wu, P. Sun, Y. Fu, R. Hong, X. Wang, and M. Wang, “A neural influence diffusion model for social recommendation,” in Proc. Int. ACM SIGIR Conf. Res. Develop. Inf. Retrieval, 2019, pp. 235–244.. DiffNet models the recursive social diffusion process for each user, such that the influence diffusion hidden in the higher-order social network is captured in the user embedding process. Despite the superior performance of DiffNet, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion process in the social network would neglect the latent collaborative interests of users hidden in the user-item interest network. To this end, in this paper, we propose DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting both the higher-order user latent interest reflected in the user-item graph and higher-order user influence reflected in the user-user graph for user embedding learning. This is achieved by iteratively aggregating each user’s embedding from three aspects: the user’s previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.

DRLFcc: Deep Reinforcement Learning-empowered Congestion Control Mechanism for TCP Fast Recovery in High Loss Wireless Networks,"TCP is currently the most widely used Internet transmission protocol, which is extensively applied to applications on the Internet to enable reliable data transmission. The TCP congestion control algorithm has a significant performance impact on all applications that use the TCP. However, traditional TCP congestion control algorithms rely on fixed feedback mechanisms, which can be challenging to adapt to complex and changing network environments and application scenarios, resulting in network performance bottlenecks. To address this issue, we design a congestion control windowing solution, DRLFcc, which is based on deep reinforcement learning and the TCP fast recovery mechanism. DRLFcc has demonstrated the ability to facilitate real-time adaptation of the congestion window to dynamic changes in network conditions while incorporating fast recovery mechanisms, thereby effectively enhancing network throughput and improving data transmission capacity recovery in high-loss wireless networks. The DRLFcc algorithm is validated in NS-3, and experimental results show an average improvement of 196% in effective throughput and a 22.4% reduction in round trip time.

Popular LLM-Large Language Models in Enterprise Applications,"For the public, understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) can be likened to recognizing how a well-trained assistant works—one that has read an extensive library of information on virtually every topic imaginable. Imagine an assistant that not only reads and remembers all this information but also learns the nuances of how words and ideas are connected across different contexts. This assistant can then use this knowledge to write articles, answer questions, compose emails, or even generate creative stories, all in a manner that feels surprisingly human. This capability comes from what's known as ""transformer architecture,"" a type of design that helps the model pay attention to different parts of the text as it reads, making it adept at understanding and generating language. LLMs are a breakthrough in technology because they can understand and produce language with a level of subtlety and complexity that was previously unachievable, making them valuable tools across various industries. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transformative impact of LLMs across various enterprise sectors. It intends to contribute to the understanding of how LLMs can enhance efficiency, innovation, and decision-making processes in industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and in the software engineering sector. It also provides a comprehensive overview of current popular LLMs in Enterprise applications, in various domains, and discusses the Ethical, Technical, and Regulatory challenges, future trends, and developments in this dynamic field.","Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC), University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA; Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC), University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA; Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC), University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA; Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC), University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA",R.

MSF-Net: Multi-Scale Feedback Reconstruction for Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution,"Guided depth map super-resolution (GDSR) is one of the mainstream methods in depth map super-resolution, as high-resolution color images can guide the reconstruction of the depth maps and are often easy to obtain. However, how to make full use of extracted guidance information of the color image to improve the depth map reconstruction remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we first design a multi-scale feedback module (MF) that extracts multi-scale features and alleviates the information loss in network propagation. We further propose a novel multi-scale feedback network (MSF-Net) for guided depth map super-resolution, which can better extract and refine the features by sequentially joining MF blocks. Specifically, our MF block uses parallel sampling layers and feedback links between multiple time steps to better learn information at different scales. Moreover, an inter-scale attention module (IA) is proposed to adaptively select and fuse important features at different scales. Meanwhile, depth features and corresponding color features are interacted using cross-domain attention conciliation module (CAC) after each MF block. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method on both synthetic and real captured datasets. Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both objective and subjective quality.","Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Department of Information and Finance Management, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA; Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China",J.

Fusion of Efficient Transformer-CNN Hybrid Network (ETCHNet) and Adaptive Deep Clustering Optimization Network (ADCONet) for Advanced IoMT-Based Surgical Monitoring With Robotics and Artificial Intelligence,"Traditional health care systems face the challenge of real-time data processing and decision-making, particularly in the surgery domain. Health gadgets based on advanced technologies like IoMT, blockchain, and AI-based systems are used for improving surgical precision and real-time monitoring. While these systems aim to enhance surgical monitoring accuracy, scalability, and efficiency, handling high-dimensional data and real-time analysis still present challenges. This study focuses on the development of a robust and scalable enhanced IoMT-based surgical monitoring system that improves precision. The framework enhances feature extraction, clustering, and decision-making using real-time feedback and blockchain for secure data storage. The proposed framework integrates ETCHNet and ADCONet with robotic automation. The first algorithm, ADCONet, clusters dynamically and builds decisions based on optimised approaches and ETCHNet extracts hybrid features using transformers and CNNs. Robotic automation provides real-time feedback and a fluid surgical interaction. The proposed method achieved 96% classification accuracy and 95% clustering accuracy, which exceeded the existing methods. It was so effective that the method detected 94.5% of anomalies and prevented 97% of collisions. Even more impressively, it did so with an inference latency of only 120 milliseconds. As a result, the solution is still ideal upon surgical real time monitoring where split second decisions are needed. These impressive results clearly prove that the system improves healthcare accuracy and effectiveness.","Tek Leaders, Texas, USA; Tek Leaders, Texas, USA; Tek Yantra Inc, California, USA; NeuraFlash, Georgia, USA; Estrada Consulting Inc, California, USA; School of Comuting and Information Technology, REVA University, Bangalore",D.

Facilitating AI and System Operator Synergy: Active Learning-Enhanced Digital Twin Architecture for Day-Ahead Load Forecasting,"In this paper, we introduce a synergistic approach between artificial intelligence and system operators through an innovative digital twin architecture, integrated with an active learning framework, to enhance short-term load forecasting. Central to this architecture is the incorporation of sophisticated data pipelines, facilitating the real-time ingestion, processing and analysis of grid-related data. Utilizing a recurrent neural network architecture, our model generates day-ahead load forecasts together with prediction confidence intervals, strengthening system operator trust in the model's predictive reliability and enhancing their ability to respond to evolving grid conditions effectively. The active learning framework iteratively refines the predictions by incorporating real-time feedback based on forecast uncertainty, utilizing newly available data to continuously enhance forecasting accuracy and confidence.

A Tale of Two Perspectives: Harvesting System Views and User Views to Understand Patient Portal Engagement,"Patient engagement is recognized as a key factor in promoting care quality and experience. Although patient portals as a prevalent information infrastructure provide a viable means to achieve engaging patients, there is still a limited understanding of how to objectively and systematically evaluate engagement levels in the context of patient portals. We develop the Patient Portal Engagement Framework (PPEF) to objectively and systematically evaluate patient portal engagement and demonstrated its utilization and effectiveness in two scenarios: portal utilization and user feedback. Four engagement levels included in the PPEF are - Inform Patients that allows patients to access health information; Involve Patients that encourages patients to take initiatives; Partner with Patients that supports long-term collaboration between patients and providers; and Support Ecology of Care that extends the scope beyond hospitals into personal and social factors. We find more portal utilization and user feedback focus in lower levels of patient portal engagement (i.e., patients receiving information and taking active actions in managing care). Our thematic analysis of online user reviews reveals four core themes: conflicts between system and user views, evolving benefits and needs towards patient portals, debates about balancing emotional and informational needs, and reconsideration of power, accessibility, and privacy. We discuss how PPEF can help harvest and synthesize data from the system and user levels, as well as the design implications for patient portals. These results show that patient portals can be designed with practical guidance for engaging patients, complementing current efforts that focus on conceptualizing engagement or rely on psychometrics.","School of Interactive Computing, College of Computing Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA; School of Interactive Computing, College of Computing Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA; Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN",J.

Emotional Well-being of a Human: A Case Study of Proposing a Digital Twin Solution Integrating IoT Sensors and Cloud Computing,"There are many different types of technology that can improve well-being and quality of life through monitoring, comprehension, and continuous feedback. One such technology is the digital twin. Consequently, employing a digital twin as a type of solution can improve an individual's emotional health and quality of life in a surrounding environment. But it will take some time to develop digital twin systems that can make it easier to create and use digital twins because there are many variables that can affect how a digital twin is designed, including the kind of sensor, complementary technologies, the context of the situation being assessed for the person, and the surrounding environment. In this paper, we describe a real-time hybrid sensor fusion strategy for environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity and brightness with respect to an individual's heart rate monitoring using machine learning models such as random forest, linear regression and ridge regression. Further, Explainable AI-SHAP is utilized to enhance the interpretability of the machine learning models, hence guaranteeing the credibility and understanding of the digital twin's predictions in this study.

Learning Variable-Rate CSI Compression with Multi-Stage Vector Quantization,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising technology to design efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback methods. The effectiveness of learned CSI compression has been proven experimentally in many previous works, but less attention was paid to the importance of scalability in practice to support variable sizes of feedback payloads. In this paper, we propose employing multi-stage vector quantization (VQ) to provide progressive variable-rate CSI compression. In particular, VQ is cascaded to find a series of low-dimensional CSI representations, which provides progressively refined approximations associated with variable feedback rates. In practice, deploying a dedicated model with a separate codebook optimized for each rate requirement is prominently challenging in the aspects of storage, on-device compiling, if needed, and model life-cycle management. To tackle this challenge, we develop a single network model with multi-stage codebooks, which is learned for various compression rates of interest jointly. Moreover, we propose employing sequential training to aid joint training by providing good initialization of network parameters with transfer learning. The simulation results shows the effectiveness of the proposed model and training method, which establish a promising design methodology of AI-enabled CSI compression.","System LSI, Samsung Electronics, South Korea; System LSI, Samsung Electronics, South Korea; System LSI, Samsung Electronics, South Korea",J.

IoT Based Meat Freshness Classification Using Deep Learning,"Meat quality and safety are critical concerns in the food industry, especially for products like beef and mutton, which are susceptible to spoilage and fraud. Traditional methods of assessing meat freshness and species classification, such as manual inspection, are often inefficient and prone to error. This paper introduces a novel Internet of Things (IoT) system that integrates gas sensors and advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning, to address these issues effectively. The system combines image-based classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with gas sensor data to provide a comprehensive, real-time solution for the classification of both beef and mutton in terms of species and freshness. The custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a dataset comprising 9,928 images, 6,672 of which were utilized for meat freshness classification and 3,256 for meat species classification. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 99%, surpassing the performance of other models, including ResNet-50, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). It is important to note that identical training and validation datasets were employed across all four models, ensuring a consistent and equitable comparison of their performance. The custom CNN showed a clear advantage in handling the complex image data, particularly in distinguishing between beef and mutton species as well as their freshness levels. The system incorporates three gas sensors—MQ135, MQ4, and MQ136—to detect gases such as ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which are released during the spoilage of meat. These gas sensor readings are utilized specifically for the classification of meat freshness. The system provides real-time feedback via LED indicators: green for fresh meat, yellow for meat that is neither fresh nor fully rotten, and red for spoiled meat. The results of the classification, based on both image data and gas readings, are displayed on an LED screen. This offers an efficient, scalable, and practical solution for real-time quality monitoring of beef and mutton. This integrated approach significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of meat safety management within the food supply chain.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), Dhaka, Bangladesh",Z.

Adaptive Payoff Balance Among Mobile Wireless Chargers for Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks,"Wireless power transfer (WPT) based on mobile platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), has been recognized as a promised technique to prolong battery lifetime of resource-constrained wireless sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. However, it is challenging to collaborate multiple mobile wireless chargers (MWCs) for coordinating heterogeneous energy requirements of massive rechargeable wireless sensors, where the efficient optimization of quantitative collaboration utility among MWCs is difficult. Hence, this article investigates the adaptive payoff balance among MWCs for rechargeable wireless sensor networks (RWSNs). First, the collaborative wireless powered system based on charging sectors control among MWCs is proposed. Then, the charging payoff function and the corresponding optimization problem for maximizing the minimum payoff are designed, and it is decomposed into two layers by the hierarchical decompose method to be solved quickly. In the bottom layer, the payoff of each MWC with the given charging sector is maximized by the convex optimization theory. According to the payoff feedback of the bottom layer, intelligent charging sectors allocation is realized by the deep reinforcement learning. The simulation results show that our algorithm can ensure efficient energy allocation of any single MWC, and the overall utility of collaborative wireless powered system on this basis can be optimized by rationally allocating charging sectors, which significantly improves the sustainability of RWSN.","Department of State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; Department of State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; Department of State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; Research Institute of Economics and Technological, State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company Ningbo Bureau, Zhejiang, China; School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Department of State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; Department of State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China",H.

A Multi-Channel Advertising Budget Allocation Using Reinforcement Learning and an Improved Differential Evolution Algorithm,"Budget allocation across multiple advertising channels involves periodically dividing a fixed total budget among various channels. Yet, the challenge of making sequential decisions to optimize long-term benefits rather than short-term gains is often overlooked. Additionally, more apparent connections must be made between actions taken on one advertising channel and the outcomes on others. Furthermore, budget limitations narrow down the range of potential optimal strategies that can be pursued. In response to these challenges, this study unveils a pioneering multi-channel advertising budget allocation approach that leverages a reinforcement learning (RL) Q-learning framework enriched with an advanced Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to refine the Q-learning methodology. The RL element makes informed sequential decisions, adeptly adjusting strategies to favor long-term rewards by assimilating environmental feedback. Complementing this, the enhanced DE algorithm introduces an inventive clustering-based mutation technique, exploiting key groupings within the DE population to generate novel and practical solutions. The model is further bolstered by a discretization tactic aimed at simplifying the model by streamlining costs.

Can An Artificial Intelligence-Powered Humanoid Chatbot Be a Quality Service Enhancer in The Insurance Industry?,"This study explores the applicability of integrating cutting-edge AI chatbots that resemble human-like interactions in the customer service area, drawing on the underlying ideas of technological readiness and anthropomorphism. The study uses 688 questionnaire responses using purposive sampling and structural equation modelling as part of its empirical research technique to learn more about how customers perceive and use AI-powered humanoid chatbots (AIPHC). The target respondents were those who had some prior experience of using chatbots. Using SmartPLS-SEM, the study determines whether anthropomorphism, i.e., AIPHC system-specific and customer personality-specific dimensions, can improve chatbot usage in the insurance sector. The results show that anthropomorphism positively influenced optimism and innovativeness but negatively impacted discomfort and security. Further optimism and innovativeness favourably impact AIPHC adoption. Insecurity had a significant negative impact, while discomfort was insignificant for AIPHC adoption. The results could help us better understand how technological readiness and system-specific theories like anthropomorphism can be used in sectors like insurance. The results highlight chatbots’ potential to raise the quality of service, simplify processes, and enhance customers’ overall experiences in the insurance sector.","Symbiosis Centre for Information Technology(SCIT), Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India; Symbiosis Centre for Information Technology(SCIT), Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India; Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resource Development (SCMHRD), Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India",K.

Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Hierarchical Adaptive Cruise Following-Control for Intelligent Vehicles,"Intelligent vehicles can effectively improve traffic congestion and road traffic safety. Adaptive cruise following-control (ACFC) is a vital part of intelligent vehicles. In this paper, a new hierarchical vehicle-following control strategy is presented by synthesizing the variable time headway model, type-2 fuzzy control, feedforward + fuzzy proportion integration (PI) feedback (F+FPIF) control, and inverse longitudinal dynamics model of vehicles. Firstly, a traditional variable time headway model is improved considering the acceleration of the lead car. Secondly, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (lT2 FLC) is designed for the upper structure of the ACFC system to simulate the driver's operating habits. To reduce the nonlinear influence and improve the tracking accuracy for the desired acceleration, the control strategy of F+FPIF is given for the lower control structure. Thirdly, the lower control method proposed in this paper is compared with the fuzzy PI control and the traditional method (no lower controller for tracking desired acceleration) separately. Meanwhile, the proportion integration differentiation (PID), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), subsection function control (SFC) and type-l fuzzy logic control (Tl FLC) are respectively compared with the IT2 FLC in control performance under different scenes. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of IT2 FLC for the upper structure and F+FPIF control for the lower structure.","College of Electric and Information Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China; College of Electric and Information Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China; State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory on Image Information Processing and Intelligent Control, the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China",H.

A Resource-Efficient Online Target Detection System With Autonomous Drone-Assisted IoT,"Mobile onboard target detection system with autonomous drone-assisted Internet of Things, due to its inherent agility and coverage-effective deployment, is beneficial in city management, ecosystem monitoring, etc. However, most advanced detection methods become inefficient or even malfunction, since the computation resources for online detection in such a high-altitude dynamic environment are far beyond the capability of the drone. To this end, we design and implement ODTDS—an online drone-based target detection system that performs online data processing and autonomous navigation simultaneously with restricted resources. Specifically, to prolong detection durations with limited energy providing for continuous processing and flying, we develop an adaptive motion planner for autonomous and energy-efficient navigation. Meanwhile, to perform online target detection from complex environments, we propose a hybrid method integrating feature pyramid feedback with the speed up robust features, to enhance the background information to achieve high accuracy on the restricted computation platform of the drone. Based on these two designs, our system can address resource-constrained challenges to accomplish detection missions autonomously. Finally, we implement an ODTDS prototype and evaluate it through outdoor high-altitude experiments. The results of various performance evaluations can demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.","College of Computer Science and Technology/College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Computer Science and Technology/College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Computer Science and Technology/College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; College of Computer Science and Technology/College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; Department of Computer Science and College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar",Q.

A Study on Development of Evaluation Indicators for Diagnosis of Digital Transformation Capability: Focus on the Financial Industry,"Convergence between industries based on digital technology and reorganization of the existing industrial order result in changes in business sources, business methods, and business expansion structure. In the financial sector, new customer-centered financial services such as strengthening customer experience and customized services are being provided, and the Big-Blur phenomenon is accelerating, where the boundaries between the high expectations of customers and the information and communication technology industry are fading. As a result, financial institutions are focusing on customer service differentiation using new technologies and are promoting Digital Transformation, which is various strategic changes in business models, and ways of working, to actively respond to changes in the digital environment. However, while the importance of digital transformation capabilities increases, there is a lack of research on specific evaluation indicators that can identify the current status or diagnose the level to promote them. Hence, in this study, the current status was identified by presenting a digital transformation competency diagnosis evaluation index suitable for the actual situation in Korea. In addition, for the purpose of setting goals, a Digital Transformation evaluation model was developed through the Delphi technique, literature survey, and previous research review, and a survey was conducted on executives and employees related to the financial industry to conduct statistical verification.","Department of IT Policy and Management, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Business Administration, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of IT Policy and Management, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea",S.

A Multi-Modal Learning Framework for MIMO Channel Information Acquisition,"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) has been proven to be a successful technology in 5G systems. Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to MIMO is expected to further boost the spectrum efficiency and capacity of MIMO for 5G-advanced and 6G, because more accurate Channel State Information (CSI) will be enabled via intelligent channel estimation and prediction. Low overhead CSI feedback is also possible when AI is utilized in the channel compression and recovery in frequency division duplex systems. However, designing separate AI models for channel estimation, prediction, and compression/recovery requires huge efforts in model training and large memory to store the model parameters. It is highly motivated to explore how to achieve accurate MIMO CSI with minimum AI model training and storage overhead for all the possible CSI related use cases. In this paper, a multi-modal learning framework is proposed for MIMO channel estimation, prediction, and compression. The framework consists of a single common feature extraction module used in all the use cases, followed by alight weight adaptation modules designed for different use cases. This proposed design is able to avoid the supernumerary extraction of shareable features for different use cases and has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the complexity of the AI models.","Future Research Lab, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China; Future Research Lab, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China; School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Future Research Lab, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China; Future Research Lab, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China",Z.

A Text Classification Methodology to Assist a Large Technical Support System,"Text-based tools for reporting technical issues and receiving support are widespread in commercial applications, such as customer services and internal corporate communication. Past issues recorded in such systems may provide valuable knowledge for better handling future interactions. Nevertheless, the predominance of short messages and the presence of specific domain subjects constitute additional challenges. In this work, we aim to build an assistant for a system operating in a large company that provides asynchronous services for technical support. It is known that some repetitive technical issues can be handled with simple standard messages, named templates. Thus, we propose a modular pipeline based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to enable raw text processing, feature extraction, and supervised learning to recommend suitable templates from a given textual description of the incoming issue. In a real-world scenario, the proposed pipeline achieved an average accuracy of 72.7%, a promising result for a setup with 9 classes and few labeled training instances. Moreover, a post hoc analysis shows how our methodology is able to correctly identify the words more closely related to the corresponding templates.","Department of Teleinformatics Engineering (DETI), UFC, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil; Department of Computer Science (DC), UFC, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil; Department of Electrical Engineering (DEE), UFC, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil; Federal Institute of Ceará (IFCE), Canidé, Ceará, Brazil; Department of Computer Science (DC), UFC, Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil",E.

Facial Expression-Driven Music Recommendation: A Novel Approach for Personalized Listening Experiences,"The potential of customized music recommendation systems to boost user happiness and engagement has gained a lot of attention in recent years. The use of non-verbal clues like facial expressions to provide better suggestions that take the user’s situation into account is gaining popularity. In this study, we provide an innovative approach to music recommendation using facial expressions, with a focus on creating unique listening sessions for each individual user. The main goal is to provide a new approach to automate music playing based on the analysis of facial expressions. Most existing techniques either need human intervention, the use of wearable computers, or the categorization of aural features. We suggest instead that music be chosen and played automatically. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully used to the problem of emotion recognition. We use Pygame and T-Kinter to implement music suggestion. By implementing our proposed strategy, we anticipate a decrease in overall system costs and processing time, which will result in enhanced precision. We evaluate the efficacy of the system using the FER dataset, which captures facial expressions using an integrated camera. These facial images are then processed to identify different emotions, such as surprise, joy, anger, sorrow, and neutrality. Based on the user’s current disposition, a music playlist is automatically generated.

CLEFT: Contextualised Unified Learning of User Engagement in Video Lectures With Feedback,"Predicting contextualised engagement in videos is a long-standing problem that has been popularly attempted by exploiting the number of views or likes using different computational methods. The recent decade has seen a boom in online learning resources, and during the pandemic, there has been an exponential rise of online teaching videos without much quality control. As a result, we are faced with two key challenges. First, how to decide which lecture videos are engaging to intrigue the listener and increase productivity, and second, how to automatically provide feedback to the content creator using which they could improve the content. The quality of the content could be improved if the creators could automatically get constructive feedback on their content. On the other hand, there has been a steep rise in developing computational methods to predict a user engagement score. In this paper, we have proposed a new unified model, CLEFT, that means “Contextualised unified Learning of user Engagement in video lectures with Feedback” that learns from the features extracted from freely available public online teaching videos and provides feedback on the video along with the user engagement score. Given the complexity of the task, our unified framework employs different pre-trained models working together as an ensemble of classifiers. Our model exploits a range of multi-modal features to model the complexity of language, context agnostic information, textual emotion of the delivered content, animation, speaker’s pitch, and speech emotions. Our results support hypothesis that proposed model can detect engagement reliably and the feedback component gives useful insights to the content creator to further help improve the content.","Brainalive Research Pvt.

EEG and HRV-Based Assessment of Neurosurgeons Training for Anxiety Regulation and Stress Monitoring,"A neurofeedback (NF) -supported training is proposed to enable neurosurgeons to learn how to regulate their emotions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal and heart rate (HR) of 5 neurosurgeons were acquired in 4 sessions while performing NF-based emotion regulation (ER). Subjects tried to counteract anxious and stressful states through NF, that is by decreasing the power in the beta band measured in the midline areas of the scalp. The assessment of the neurofeedback effectiveness was based on the use of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in combination with EEG. Therefore, EEG signal was exploited in real-time to guide the feedback and also in post processing, together with the HRV, to assess the effectiveness of the whole training. As the EEG signal is concerned, the results showed that the power in the beta band decreased within each session when the ER ability was strengthened, as reported in the literature. On the contrary, the HRV did not exhibit the expected increasing trend within each trial. When considering each the session on the whole, thus computing the HRV on a greater time interval, the HRV during the NF training is typically higher than the HRV computed during the rest and negative baseline phases.","Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; I.R.C.C.S.

Automatic Robotic Development through Collaborative Framework by Large Language Models,"Despite the remarkable code generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), they still face challenges in complex task handling. Robot development, a highly intricate field, inherently demands human involvement in task allocation and collaborative teamwork[1]. To enhance robot development, we propose an innovative automated collaboration framework inspired by real-world robot developers. This framework employs multiple LLMs in distinct roles-analysts, programmers, and testers. Analysts delve deep into user requirements, enabling programmers to produce precise code, while testers fine-tune the parameters based on user feedback for practical robot application. Each LLM tackles diverse, critical tasks within the development process. Clear collaboration rules emulate real-world teamwork among LLMs. Analysts, programmers, and testers form a cohesive team overseeing strategy, code, and parameter adjustments [2]. Through this framework, we achieve complex robot development without requiring specialized knowledge, relying solely on non-experts' participation.","School of Electrical Engineering Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China; School of Electrical Engineering Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China; School of Electrical Engineering Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China; College of Artificial Intelligence Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China; College of Artificial Intelligence Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China; College of Artificial Intelligence Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China; China Academy of Aerospace Science and Innovation, Bei'jing, China; China Academy of Aerospace Science and Innovation, Bei'jing, China",Z.

Amaretto: An Active Learning Framework for Money Laundering Detection,"Monitoring financial transactions is a critical Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligation for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning-based transaction monitoring systems have successfully complemented traditional rule-based systems to reduce the high number of false positives and the effort needed to review all the alerts manually. Unfortunately, machine learning-based solutions also have disadvantages: while unsupervised models can detect novel anomalous patterns, they are usually characterized by a high number of false alarms; supervised models, instead, usually offers a higher detection rate but require a large amount of labeled data to achieve such performance. In this paper, we present Amaretto, an active learning framework for money laundering detection that combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to support the transaction monitoring processes by improving the detection performance and reducing the compliance management costs. Amaretto exploits novel selection strategies to target a subset of transactions for investigation, making more efficient use of the feedback provided by the analyst. We perform the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset provided by the industrial partner, which simulates the profiles of clients trading in international capital markets. We show that Amaretto outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by reducing money laundering risk and improving detection performance. In particular, we compare state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised techniques commonly used in the AML domain with the ones implemented in this work. We show that the Isolation and Random Forests of Amaretto perform best in the task under analysis, with an AUROC of 0.9 for the first (20% better on average) and a detection rate of 0.793 for the second (30 % better on average). In addition, they are characterized by lower investigation costs computed in terms of the daily number of transactions to be examined and the number of false positives and false negatives. Finally, we compare Amaretto against a state-of-the-art active learning fraud detection system, achieving better detection performances and lower costs in all the analyzed scenarios. Worth mentioning, Amaretto improves the detection rate up to 50 % and reduces the overall cost by 20% in the most realistic scenario under analysis.","Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy; Napier Technologies Ltd, London, U.K.; Napier Technologies Ltd, London, U.K.; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy; Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy",D.

Unsupervised Feature Learning for Text Pattern Analysis with Emotional Data Collection: A Novel System for Big Data Analytics,"When it comes to our everyday life, emotions have a critical role to play. It goes without saying that it is critical in the context of mobile–computer interaction. In social and mobile communication, it is vital to understand the influence of emotions on the way people interact with one another and with the material they access. This lesson tried to investigate the relationship between the expressive state of mind and the efficacy of the human–mobile interaction while accessing a variety of different sorts of material over the course of the learning. In addition, the difficulty of the feeling of many individuals is taken into account in this research. Human hardness is an important factor in determining a person's personality characteristics, and the material that they can access will alter depending on how they engage with a mobile device. It analyses the link between the human-mobile interaction and the person's mental toughness in order to provide excellent suggestion material in the appropriate manner. In this study, an explicit feedback selection method is used to gather information on the emotional state of the mind of the participants. It has also been shown that the emotional state of a person's mind influences the human-mobile connection, with persons with varying levels of hardness accessing a variety of various sorts of material.

Optimizing Video Conferencing QoS: A DRL-based Bitrate Allocation Framework,"As the user count for video-related services continues to grow, ensuring high-quality service (QoS) for them will become even more crucial in the future. Many studies have been conducted to enhance the quality of on-demand video streaming using adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI). This study addresses a more complex challenge than that of on-demand video streaming: enhancing service quality in multi-party, full-duplex communication scenarios, such as video conferences. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based video bitrate allocation framework for a media server in the video conferencing system. Our framework aims to increase overall QoS by applying an appropriate bitrate for each connection in a video conferencing call, considering the network conditions for users. We train the DRL model to maximize the aggregate QoS of users in a meeting by constructing a feedback loop between a media server and a DRL server. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework can adaptively control the video bitrate according to changes in network conditions. As a result, it achieves higher video bitrates in the user application (approximately, 5% under stable network conditions and 35% over the highly dynamic network conditions) compared to the existing rule-based bandwidth allocation.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea; Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence, POSTECH, Korea; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea",K.

Generative AI-Driven Automation of Business Process ReImagination,"Traditional business process automation primarily concentrates on digitizing processes to achieve specific outcomes. However, it grapples with challenges stemming from manual configurations and inflexible workflows, restricting adaptability and creativity. This paper delves into the transformative potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing process automation, addressing the limitations inherent in traditional approaches. In contrast to traditional automation, Generative AI adopts a groundbreaking approach by harnessing data from past automation solutions to identify more effective methods. This goes beyond conventional orchestration, dynamically integrating software components, automatically generating rules from historical automation solutions data, and seamlessly integrating external systems. Generative AI unlocks its potential through the analysis of past workflows, gaining insights into components, decisions, and sequences. This knowledge serves as the foundation for creating new, efficient processes based on user-described natural language, resulting in robust workflows and rules that assimilate lessons from past best practices and adapt as needed.

Intelligent Access to Unlicensed Spectrum: A Mean Field Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"As the demand for mobile data traffic continues to grow, offloading data traffic to unlicensed spectrum is a promising approach that can relieve the pressure on cellular systems. Therefore, it is an urgent need to propose an unlicensed spectrum access method to guarantee the harmonious and efficient coexistence between cellular network technologies such as LTE and incumbent users such as WiFi in the unlicensed spectrum. However, existing coexistence schemes such as licensed assisted access (LAA) and LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) still suffer from inefficient spectrum utilization and unsatisfactory fairness. In the paper, we formulate the optimization problem of the unlicensed spectrum access among multiple small bases (SBSs) as a game, and then solve the Nash Equilibrium (NE) with cooperative and distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Specifically, a two level access framework for the coexistence scenario, which consists of feedback cycle and executive cycle, is first proposed, and then the key elements of MADRL including state, action, reward and Q-network are designed in detail based on the proposed access framework. To overcome the problems of learning divergence and prohibitive computation overhead in the coexistence scenario with multiple SBSs due to the non-stability phenomena, we adopt the mean field technology to solve the NE, which can simplify the process of solving NE by converting the interaction of an agent with the remaining multiple agents into an action with the average effect of them. Simulation results show that 1) the proposed algorithm can overcome the learning divergence problem and converge to the NE quickly, and 2) the proposed algorithm can achieve the bi-objective optimization of total throughput and fairness of the coexistence network, and can achieve better performance in terms of throughput and fairness compared with the baseline methods such as Cat-4 LBT, Cooperative LBT and Random schemes.","School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China; National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; National Key Laboratory on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China; School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China; Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K",E.

"Dynamic Wide Area Situational Awareness: Propelling Future Decentralized, Decarbonized, Digitized, and Democratized Electricity Grids","The millions of consumer-owned distributed energy resources (DERs) forecast for the grid by 2050 will trigger a major system change away from centralized monopolistic utilities to decentralized community projects exploiting innovative business models. Such a disruptive change, needed to switch to a carbon-neutral economy, requires rethinking both the economics and dynamics of power systems, knowing that the electric power sector is going digital. DER-driven uncertainties will impose costly operational margins and preventive measures based on solving very complex optimization problems. Keeping human operators in the loop to supervise actions can limit reaction time severely by making it difficult to respond in a timely manner when multiple control systems are required to stabilize the grid. The operator will hence need to be assisted by an artificial intelligence system trained at learning “good” decisions by imitating operators and assessing the associated operational risk. Hierarchical monitoring and control systems working in tandem with decentralized markets and resources will allow the true secure limits of decentralized, decarbonized, digitized, and democratized (4D) grids to be identified. This will be done with preventive/corrective actions executed in seconds while balancing grid cost versus safety, reliability, and stability.","Laval University, Québec City, Canada",I.

AI-Enabled Motion Detection System for Smart Healthcare Environment,"Humans' bad habits are a leading cause of many chronic illnesses. Preventative medicines and telemedicine courses for treating these conditions are proliferating. The availability of secure and pleasurable alternatives continues to be of paramount importance. When it comes to monitoring and studying human health, inertial measurement units (IMU) are frequently viewed as the most objective and least intrusive alternative due to their ability to identify motion patterns with relative ease. Machine learning is commonly regarded as an effective method for analysing IMU data and identifying motion patterns. As part of a smart healthcare learning tool, we describe a deep learning-based technique for detecting human movements. An innovative hybrid adjectives-based on before-classification & multi-features analysis technique is created to classify human motion for usage in healthcare e-learning. To begin, a Kalman filter is used to do preliminary processing on the raw data from the IMUs. An experiment is conducted in which minimum and average gravity reduction techniques are used to the acceleration data. Signal segmentation has been used to data from a variety of time periods to establish which kind of segmentation is most effective. Then, we identify active as well as passive motion patterns to do a preliminary categorization. Both static and dynamic motion patterns have been analysed to recover characteristics. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to categorise the active and passive motion components of healthcare e-learning. We accomplished this using the wearable computing and REALDISP datasets. In experimental comparisons, our proposed method for intelligent health care learning surpassed the current state-of-the-art systems. Implementing the technique as recommended led to an accuracy of 87.35% for the REALDISP dataset & 85.18 on the wearable computers dataset. Furthermore, a smart healthcare advisor is provided with access to the classified motion sequences in order to provide immediate feedback on human health.","Department of Information Technology, Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, Maharashtra, India; Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karpagam Academy of Higher Education, Coimbatore; Centre of Research Impact and Outcome, Chitkara University, Rajpura, Punjab, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Prince Shri Venkateshwara Padmavathy Engineering College, Chennai; Quantum University Research Center, Quantum University, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India; Adjunct Faculty School of Mangement - PG Management, JAIN (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, Karnataka",D.

For answer generation, a fine-tuned Llama 3 model on a variation of the spider dataset is used. MongoDB has been utilized for scalable data storage and React for an intuitive front-end interface. The platform enables an instructor to upload datasets and automatically generate SQL-based tests for students. Students are also given immediate feedback regarding their SQL queries, which otherwise is a labor-intensive task. The platform can also overcome challenges that traditional SQL education face, such as inconsistency in grading and delay in giving feedback, thereby offering personalized feedback, comprehensive performance reports, and engaging learners. Our solution would lighten the burden of teaching SQL by ensuring less effort from instructors while teaching their students dynamically, through the assessment of queries in a real-time setting. By automation in conjunction with the feature of real-time interactivity, this solution has been steered toward an effective and scalable learning experience for SQL by both educators and learners.","AI Department, MPSTME, SVKM’S NMIMS, Mumbai; AI Department, MPSTME, SVKM’S NMIMS, Mumbai; AI Department, MPSTME, SVKM’S NMIMS, Mumbai",M.

Machine Learning Enables Radio Resource Allocation in the Downlink of Ultra-Low Latency Vehicular Networks,"Autonomous driving and intelligent transportation demand ultra-low latency and high reliability communication in future vehicular networks. Proactive wireless communication can facilitate minimal latency by open-loop communication, which discards traditional feedback control mechanisms. However, appropriate radio resource allocation in such proactive mobile networks has not been fully studied due to lacking channel state information (CSI) and the alleviation of multiple access interference (MAI) in multiple virtual cells. This paper aims to ensure the reliability of downlink communication by a novel radio resource allocation scheme in proactive vehicular networks with ultra-low latency. We regard data transmission success rate as the reliability indicator and propose a joint radio resource allocation model based on the “generalized closed-loop”, where anchor node (AN) uses the radio resource utilization information (RRUI) from the vehicle in the immediate past uplink as a guide to assist resource allocation. Subsequently, we study the radio resource allocation model solution on the vehicle side and the network side respectively. On the vehicle side, vehicles use the local or global data transmission experience to select the radio resource with the best quality as the RRUI. On the network side, according to the latest RRUI of vehicle and resource occupancy information, deep reinforcement learning is proposed to make appropriate radio resource allocation decisions. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the intelligent joint radio resource allocation scheme under the cooperation between vehicles and AN. When the resource load rate reaches 40%, the joint radio resource allocation scheme can achieve a data transmission success rate of more than 98%.","National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Mobile Network Technologies, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Digital Productivity and Services Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Marsfield, NSW, Australia",X.

Artificial Intelligence-Based Traffic Signal Control for Urban Transportation Systems,"Extended Abstract Optimizing traffic signal control is crucial for the smooth operation of urban transportation systems. The challenge is to minimize vehicle delays and emissions, requiring a deep understanding of traffic dynamics at intersections. Traditional algorithms determined the number of vehicles stopping at an intersection by subtracting the flow of non-right-turning vehicles entering from the flow of vehicles exiting. Methods based on this are not taking the full dynamics of traffic behavior into consideration. Their performance is thus limited. Acknowledging the significance of this fundamental aspect, our research aims to introduce a novel algorithm. This innovative approach goes beyond conventional methods, integrating the dynamics of starting and stopping cars, with the goal of surpassing the limitations of previous solutions. Our work stems from the recognition of the pivotal role that efficient traffic signal control plays in urban transportation systems. With a focus on minimizing average vehicle delay within a specific timeframe, we aspire to make a meaningful contribution to the establishment of a sustainable and intelligent traffic management system. The motivation behind the project lies in the pursuit of a harmonious balance between rapid vehicle throughput and reduced environmental impact. Our approach involves designing a variety of solutions by blending traditional traffic engineering principles with our innovative algorithm. In the proposed model, history traffic data are used to train the traffic prediction for the future timeslots. Instantaneous intersection dynamics are also input into the model to trigger the parameter update and traffic prediction. This learn-and-predict AI process improves the model adaptation to changes. It tolerates local errors occurring in a short timeframe without sacrificing the overall performance. Prototyping plays a crucial role in testing and refining our approach. Using VISSIM software with AI methods, simulations have confirmed the effectiveness of our model. Additionally, community engagement activities, such as workshops and demonstrations, offer valuable real-world insights, influencing the development of our methodology. The prototype and simulations demonstrate promising results, highlighting a reduction in both average vehicle delay and the number of start-stop cycles. These findings align with our objectives of promoting efficient traffic flow and minimizing emissions. The positive feedback received during community engagement activities further confirms the real-world potential impact of our approach. The proposed algorithm can be refined based on additional real-world data. Collaborating with local authorities for potential implementation in select intersections is a key objective. The next phase will involve leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms to iteratively improve and evolve our model, ensuring it remains at the forefront of traffic signal optimization.","Rutgers Preparatory School, USA; Rutgers Preparatory School, USA",M.

Isolating Compiler Bugs by Generating Effective Witness Programs With Large Language Models,"Compiler bugs pose a significant threat to safety-critical applications, and promptly as well as effectively isolating these bugs is crucial for assuring the quality of compilers. However, the limited availability of debugging information on reported bugs complicates the compiler bug isolation task. Existing compiler bug isolation approaches convert the problem into a test program mutation problem, but they are still limited by ineffective mutation strategies or high human effort requirements. Drawing inspiration from the recent progress of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in code generation, we propose a new approach named LLM4CBI to utilize LLMs to generate effective test programs for compiler bug isolation. However, using LLMs directly for test program mutation may not yield the desired results due to the challenges associated with formulating precise prompts and selecting specialized prompts. To overcome the challenges, three new components are designed in LLM4CBI. First, LLM4CBI utilizes a program complexity-guided prompt production component, which leverages data and control flow analysis to identify the most valuable variables and locations in programs for mutation. Second, LLM4CBI employs a memorized prompt selection component, which adopts reinforcement learning to select specialized prompts for mutating test programs continuously. Third, a test program validation component is proposed to select specialized feedback prompts to avoid repeating the same mistakes during the mutation process. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches (DiWi and RecBi) over 120 real bugs from the two most popular compilers, namely GCC and LLVM, our evaluation demonstrates the advantages of LLM4CBI: It can isolate 69.70%/21.74% and 24.44%/8.92% more bugs than DiWi and RecBi within Top-1/Top-5 ranked results. Additionally, we demonstrate that the LLMs component (i.e., GPT-3.5) used in LLM4CBI can be easily replaced by other LLMs while still achieving reasonable results in comparison to related studies.","School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China; School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore; School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore; School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore",H.

Innovative Load Frequency Control: Integrating Adaptive Backstepping and Disturbance Observers,"Load frequency control (LFC) in large interconnected power systems is crucial for balancing electricity supply and demand while minimizing frequency deviations. Traditional methods like proportional-integral-derivative (PID)controllers and advanced techniques such as evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) have limitations, including computational complexity, sensitivity to parameter changes, and high resource demands. This paper introduces a novel decentralized observer-based backstepping control (DOBC) strategy to overcome these challenges. In our work, each area controller utilizes local measurements and feedback signals to regulate its own area frequency. This approach inherently reduces the reliance on centralized communication and minimizes the impact of potential communication failures, such as packet losses and delays. The proposed method synergistically combines backstepping and disturbance observer techniques, resulting in rapid and stable system responses with reduced control effort, while a noncertainty equivalent adaptive approach ensures exponential disturbance estimation and maintains system stability under time-varying disturbances. Unlike conventional sliding mode control, the proposed method eliminates chattering, making it suitable for sensitive applications. Simulations validate its effectiveness under time delays, parametric uncertainties, nonlinearities, and load disturbances. Results show superior transient response, better oscillation damping, and lower control effort compared to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system based fractional-order PID-acceleration controller (ANFIS-FOPIDA), Second-Order sliding mode control (SOSMC), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper concludes with a rigorous stability and robustness analysis, demonstrating the method’s resilience to parametric uncertainties and time-varying disturbances.

Enabling Efficient Data Integration of Industry 5.0 Nodes Through Highly Accurate Neural CSI Feedback,"Industry 5.0 refers to the fifth industrial revolution that leverages advanced technologies such as Internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to increase efficiency, productivity, and flexibility in manufacturing and other industries. Wireless IoT devices help collect and transmit real-time data to support intelligent decision-making, while AI algorithms process and analyze the data to optimize production processes, predict equipment failure, and enhance supply chain management. To achieve efficient integration for the data fused by various sensors, the data should be perfectly synchronized and out-of-errors.

The methodology constructs user-item interaction graphs based on viewing patterns and applies centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness) to identify important videos. Modularity-based clustering groups related content, enabling personalized recommendations. The system was evaluated on a documentary-focused VOD platform with 328 users over four months. Results showed significant improvements: a 63% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 24% increase in view completion rate, and a 17% improvement in user satisfaction.

Due to these platforms now communication has become easier and it has provided us with opportunities to use social media channels for various businesses. The survival of an e-commerce business highly relies on customers’ opinions or feedback extensively articulated on internet-based social media platforms or social networking sites. Eventually, analysis of these public opinions from these platforms to identify and demonstrate the cumulative meaningful information is the prime objective of Sentiment Analysis (SA). Summarization of this informative knowledge is advantageous for companies, organizations, and industrialist analysts to improve the quality of their products or services. In this scenario, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has proven to be a powerful companion for companies, organizations, and producers to specify the consumers’ attitudes and opinions towards products and brands’ impressive features. Various efforts have contributed to aspect extraction and sentiment classification over the last few decades. In this review study, we first focus on two diverse research tasks, aspect extraction, and aspect sentiment analysis and then we present a comprehensive review of existing studies in various classifications such as lexicon-based, graph data, topic models, machine learning, and deep learning. This diverse analysis provides pros and cons for various research approaches and comparative analysis. We also discuss various sources and details of datasets, which are used in this research study.

"Intelligent Sales Forecasting System Using Arima, Sarima, and Xgboost Models","Sales forecasting plays a pivotal role in predicting future revenue by estimating product or service volumes within a specified time frame. Accurate sales forecasting drives strategic decisions, such as pricing, store allocation, ordering, and inventory management, benefiting all departments within an organization. However, many companies still face challenges due to disconnections between departments and inadequate sharing of information from sales forecasts. This can lead to misalignment between product marketing’s demand plans and sales quotas, resulting in excessive or insufficient inventory and inaccurate sales targets. To address these challenges, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, were adopted. This research focuses on developing an intelligent sales forecasting system using Python and TensorFlow. The system incorporates data preparation, model training, evaluation, and iterative refinement. The ARIMA, SARIMA, and XGBoost models are compared, and the XGBoost model outperforms the others in terms of RMSE (727.13), MSE (528718.04), and MAE (261.29). The research demonstrates the significance of accurate sales forecasting for seamless business operations, improved credibility in the market, and enhanced productivity. By continually refining the models and leveraging insights from user feedback, the system can adapt to changing business requirements and remain competitive in predicting future sales accurately.","Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Nigeria; Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Nigeria; Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Nigeria; Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Nigeria; Department of Computer Engineering, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Nigeria; Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Nigeria; Department of Computer Science, Baze University, Abuja, Nigeria",O.

A User-Centred Interaction Design: A Holistic Approach,"User-centered design (UCD) plays a critical role in product development by focusing on creating interactive products that effectively meet the diverse needs of users. This study introduces a comprehensive approach that integrates the Agile Scrum software development life-cycle (SDLC) with a strong emphasis on usability and explainability. In our approach, users were actively involved as co-designers throughout the entire development process. This involvement was crucial for enhancing both the usability and explainability of the product. To assess the practical application of this approach, we applied it to developing a deep learning-based tea fermentation detection model. We engaged users extensively through various methods, including questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, and direct observation, to gather detailed requirements and feedback. The integration of user feedback into the Interactive Design (ID) process aimed to refine and improve the product based on real user experiences. Our findings indicate that this user-centered approach resulted in a 10% increase in project costs and a 25% extension of the timeline. Despite these additional investments, the positive feedback received from users justified the increased expenditure. Notably, our study revealed that female users reported lower levels of satisfaction compared to their male counterparts, a trend consistent with other research. This suggests a need for further exploration into the factors contributing to this disparity and high-lights the importance of addressing gender-specific concerns in software design. Overall, this study underscores the effectiveness of combining agile methodologies with user-centered principles to achieve high usability and explainability. The insights gained emphasize the necessity for continued research into creating more inclusive and effective software solutions. Addressing the diverse needs of all users, including understanding gender-specific differences leads to products that have equitable user experiences and higher satisfaction across various demographics.","Mathematics, Physics and Computing, Moi University, Eldoret, Kenya; Sustainable Communication Networks, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany",G.

Proactive Random-Forest Autoscaler for Microservice Resource Allocation,"Cloud service providers have been shifting their workloads to microservices to take advantage of their modularity, flexibility, agility, and scalability. However, numerous obstacles remain to achieving the most out of microservice deployments, especially in terms of a Quality of Service (QoS). One possible approach to overcoming these obstacles is to perform autoscaling, which is the ability of cloud infrastructure and services to scale themselves up or down by changing their resource pool. There are two major categories of autoscaling: reactive and proactive. In reactive autoscaling, a feedback loop based on current workload resource usage is implemented to guide resource scaling. One disadvantage of reactive autoscaling is that it may result in inconsistencies between workload demand and resource allocation. In proactive autoscaling, a prediction model is used to guide the future allocation of resources according to current workload metrics. In this paper, a novel proactive autoscaling method is introduced where a two-state, machine-learning Random Forest (RF) model is designed to forecast the future CPU and memory utilization values required by the microservice workload. These predicted values are then used to adjust the resource pool both vertically (hardware resources) and horizontally (microservice replicas). The RF proactive autoscaler has been implemented on a home-grown, open-source microservice prototyping platform and verified using real-world workloads. The experiments show that the RF proactive autoscaler outperforms state-of-the-art ones in terms of allocated resources and latency. The increase in the utilization of allocated resources can reach 90% and the improvement in end-to-end latency, measured by the  $95^{th}$  percentile, can reach 95%.","Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS), Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",L.

Usually, a dense radiomap is reconstructed from sparse observations collected by deployed sensors or mobile devices. To leverage both physical principles of radio propagation models and data statistics from sparse observations, this work introduces a novel task-incentivized generative learning model, namely TiRE-GAN, for radiomap estimation. Specifically, we first introduce a radio depth map to capture the overall pattern of radio propagation and shadowing effects, following which a task-driven incentive network is proposed to provide feedback for radiomap compensation depending on downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the power of the radio depth map to capture radio propagation information, and the efficiency of the proposed TiRE-GAN for radiomap estimation.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA",Y.

Natural Language Generation for Socially Competent Task-Oriented Agent,"Conversational Artificial Intelligence has been used in many industrial use cases, especially in customer service. While emotion is often associated with chit-chat and open-domain interactions, it is still a core aspect of human interaction. Though arguably less frequent, a customer’s emotional and social displays are very meaningful in official task-oriented dialogue. Hence why it is crucial for vocal dialogue systems to learn how to properly detect and adapt their behaviour to respond to this social context. This context can be represented by textual and semantic content, but it can also be multimodal, using prosody elements extracted from speech analysis. This research aims to investigate a method to take these social and emotional components for conditional generation, in order to develop a socially competent, task-oriented conversational agent. In this Doctoral Consortium paper, I introduce my PhD subject, its scope, and the main research questions we tackle. I give an overview of the related works, before presenting the methodology, the work done, and the avenues we intend on exploring in order to respond to our established research objectives.","LTCI, Telecom-Paris & Zaion Lab Institut Polytechnique de Paris & Zaion, Paris, France",L.

Integrating Deep Neural Network and Optimization Algorithm for Superior User Comfort and Energy Efficiency in Smart Home,"Efficient energy utilization while ensuring occupants’ comfort remains a primary objective in smart home environments. This study presents a novel smart home management methodology that integrates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with an optimization algorithm to enhance energy efficiency and user comfort. Unlike traditional approaches, which often focus on individual aspects of energy management or user comfort, our method comprehensively addresses both aspects by considering key environmental factors such as air quality, temperature, and illumination. By employing specialized DNNs, our approach dynamically adjusts home conditions to align with user preferences, thereby enhancing overall comfort and satisfaction. The primary innovation of our methodology lies in the Comfort Index Calculation System, which utilizes advanced DNNs to precisely quantify user comfort based on environmental conditions. This system enables our optimization algorithm to iteratively adjust environmental settings, striking a balance between user comfort and energy consumption. By continuously learning from user feedback and environmental data, our integrated approach ensures that smart homes adapt to occupants’ evolving preferences and external conditions, thereby offering a more personalized and responsive living environment. Our results demonstrate the capability of this integrated approach in improving smart home environments, offering significant implications for environmental living and smart building automation. By bridging the gap between energy efficiency and user comfort, our study contributes to advancing the field of smart home management, ultimately realizing the full potential of energy-efficient and comfortable living environments.","Department of Environemntal IT Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Computer Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Department of Computer Science, College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia; Department of Environemntal IT Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea",J.

Towards a Taxonomy of Industrial Challenges and Enabling Technologies in Industry 4.0,"In the era of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), a significant challenge hindering digital transformation is the lack of mutual understanding between academia—particularly within engineering and computer science—and the industrial sector, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This gap can result in industries missing out on the potential benefits of cutting-edge scientific research and innovations that can address their daily concerns. At the same time, academics may struggle to identify real-world application areas for their emerging technological solutions. Moreover, the ever-increasing complexity of industrial challenges and technologies has widened the hiatus. To address this issue, our study introduces a comprehensive taxonomy, developed through a transparent, iterative process and presented via a user-centric web platform. Distinct from existing taxonomies, ours emphasizes practical applicability by categorizing and connecting industrial challenges with I4.0 technologies using articles, best practices, and use cases from academic and grey literature, thereby effectively bridging the academic-industrial communication gap. Its effectiveness and practical utility were validated in a workshop as part of the Erasmus+ project PLANET4, where industry professionals provided positive feedback after applying it to real-world challenges. Future work will include expanding the taxonomy, developing an Industry 4.0 ontology, and further enhancing the usability and maintainability of the developed web platform.","Computer Science Department, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Computer Science Department, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece; Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece; Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, Rzeszów University of Technology, Rzeszów, Poland; Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, Rzeszów University of Technology, Rzeszów, Poland; Research Group in Internet Technologies and Storage, La Salle Universitat Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain; Research Group in Internet Technologies and Storage, La Salle Universitat Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain; Research Group in Internet Technologies and Storage, La Salle Universitat Ramon Llull, Barcelona, Spain; Computer Science Department, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy",R.

Twitter Based Complaint Management System for Rail Transit,"People can now more easily express their opinions and ideas to a wider audience through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Among these social media applications, Twitter has the most trusted users and is one of the most used, with many users tweeting millions of tweets per day. Trusted users, including small and large organizations or companies, respond to customer’s tweets that convey their thoughts, like complaints or suggestions, by retweeting them using the microblogging service provided by Twitter. In today’s competitive world, Indian Railways manages the second largest railway system by size, which encourages users to communicate to them through tweets on Twitter. This results in a sheer volume of data and makes it impossible for the Railway Administration to answer each user's query or complaint. Sometimes these complaints may include some urgent matters or questions requiring prompt attention. The proposed method focuses on implementing a website where the tweets are classified into different categories based on their temporal nature and are prioritized in cases of emergency. This proposed solution helps the railway administration to easily reply to the tweets and know their quality of service based on the users’ feedback.","Department of Information Science and Engineering, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, India; Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, India; Information Science and Engineering Department, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, India; Information Science and Engineering Department, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, India; Information Science and Engineering Department, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, India",S.

Research and Application of Early Warning of Power Customer-Side Demand Based on KG Technology,"With the development of power system reform and the focus of competition on power customers, customer-side demand early warning is becoming an important research topic of State Grid. In response to the problems of too many factors related to customer-side demand, complex interactions, and difficulties in early warning, researchers in related fields have conducted some research with traditional early warning methods in recent years. However, there are still some difficulties such as long data processing time, low accuracy, and unclear correlation among data. To address these issues, we propose a method of early warning of power customer-side demand based on Knowledge Graph (KG) by exploiting the strong reasoning and analysis capabilities of KG. In the relationship extraction of the accepted content of power customer-side demands, we use Transduction Projection Model (TPM) to realize the simultaneous learning of the projection matrix of the hypernym-hyponym relations and the non-hypernym-hyponym relations. The method presents the logical relationships between demand data in figures by establishing the customer-side demand KG, which enables in-depth processing, inference analysis, and early warning management of power customer demand data. Our method can analyze the similarity of customer-side demand and provide early warning of similar demand, which makes an important contribution to further reducing power customer-side demand and improving power customer satisfaction.","State Grid Zhejiang Shaoxing Power Supply Company, Zhejiang, China; Marketing Department, State Grid Zhejiang Power Company, Zhejiang, China; Marketing Department, State Grid Zhejiang Power Company, Zhejiang, China; Marketing Department, State Grid Zhejiang Power Company, Zhejiang, China; Marketing Department, State Grid Zhejiang Power Company, Zhejiang, China; Marketing Department, State Grid Zhejiang Power Company, Zhejiang, China; Shanghai University of Power, Shanghai, China",S.

Energy-Constrained Online Scheduling for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks,"In satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, it is a common practice to schedule real-time tasks from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to ground stations (GSs) for data processing. However, the joint task scheduling and resource allocation under unknown environment dynamics (e.g., transmission latency) remains to be a challenging problem. First, the tradeoff between task latencies and energy consumption should be carefully considered when making decisions to minimize task latencies under time-averaged energy consumption constraints. Second, to learn the environment uncertainties and minimize the system performance loss (i.e., regret) in terms of task latencies, both online feedback and offline history should be leveraged efficiently, and the accompanying exploration-exploitation tradeoff should be dealt with in a proper way. In this article, we formulate the joint task scheduling and resource allocation problem as a constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. To solve the problem, by integrating online learning, online control, and offline historical information, we propose a Task scheduling and Resource allocation scheme with Data-driven Bandit Learning called TRDBL. Our theoretical and numerical results show that TRDBL achieves a sublinear time-averaged regret while satisfying the time-averaged energy consumption constraints.","School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society, Shenzhen, China; School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Institute of Fog Computing Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China",X.

How can Generative AI Support Education?,"The possible applications of GenAI (Generative AI) in education alone are so manyfold and overwhelming that it is useful to have an overview of the many possibilities that are opening up. In this paper, we try to organize some of the low-hanging fruits that can help instructors, learners, and educational managers use GenAI applications to improve educational performance. For instructors, GenAI can help in gaining a deeper understanding of the topics to be taught, preparing educational materials, and facilitating the enactment phase in class. Learners can be assisted in getting personalized content and feedback, having GenAI as a participant in forums, or for self-reflection and emotions detection. Managers and other stakeholders can profit from Academic Analytics, bias detection, course repurposing, and many other uses. In this paper, we also present a use case detailing some initial actions we are implementing for a Programming with Java course. One action is to explicitly identify, in each problem set, the competencies being developed. Another one is the development of a chatbot, fine-tuned with the course material, which can be used by students as a tutor. The third action is to use a GenAI tool to generate questions aimed at assessing whether students truly grasp the programming project they have supposedly developed. AI is here to stay, in spite of the issues it opens up, and therefore it is never too early to start experimenting with it in practice.","Dept.

Condition Monitoring on Railway Construction Site Using Timelapse Videos,"Railway systems are usually in an open world environment. They are subject to climatic variations and their effects. A particularly disastrous event is landslides on tracks, which may cause heavy damages to the travelers and rolling stock. In response to those incidents, railway companies organize emergency work to clear the rails and to strengthen the earthen structure. During the reinforcement work, cracks may appear in the embankment, the landslide may spread, and boulders sometimes fall. To monitor and secure those areas, a timelapse device is installed. To date it provides hundreds of pictures a day, during daytime, as long as the construction work lasts to get feedbacks on the renovation process and train new agents. Data are also used to understand how events unfold through post-acquisition analysis by experts. The addition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the system could develop the possibilities offered by the system.

Theory of the optimum signal approximation clarifying the importance in the recognition of parallel world and application to secure signal communication with feedback,"In this paper, it is shown a base of the new trend of algorithm mathematically that treats a historical reason of continuous discrimination in the world as well as its solution by introducing new concepts of parallel world that includes an invisible set of errors as its companion. With respect to a matrix operator-filter bank that the ma-trix operator-analysis-filter bank H and the matrix operator-sampling-filter bank S are given, firstly, we introduce the detail algorithm to derive the optimum matrix operator-synthesis-filter bank Z that minimizes all the worst-case measures of the matrix operator-error-signals $\mathbf{E}(\omega)=\mathbf{F}(\omega)-\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$ between the matrix operator-input-signals $\mathbf{F}(\omega)$ and the matrix operator-output-signals $\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$ of the matrix operator-filter bank at the same time. Further, feedback is introduced to the above approximation theory and it is indicated that introducing conversations with feedback do not superior automatically to the accumulation of existing knowledge of signal prediction. Secondly, the concept of category in the field of mathematics is applied to the above optimum signal approximation and is indicated that the category-based approximation theory is applied to the set-theoretic con-sideration of the recognition of human. Based on this discussion, it is shown naturally, why the narrow perception that tends to create isolation shows an apparent advantage in the short term and, often, why such narrow thinking becomes intimate with discriminatory action in a human group. Throughout these considerations, it is presented that, in order to abolish easy and intimate discriminatory behavior, it is important create a parallel world of conception where we share the set of invisible error signals including the words and the consciousness of both worlds.","Professor Emeritus Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; The School of Pharmaceutical Sciences Ohu University, Koriyama, Japan",T.

Research on Target Detection and Depth Estimation in Binocular Images Based on YOLOv8,"As artificial intelligence technology enters a new era, target detection in binocular images and depth estimation have entered a high-quality development stage. We are committed to developing deep learning with YOLOv8 and proposing the issue of algorithms that meet the needs of image recognition and depth perception for intelligent vision. Based on the dynamic development of YOLOv8, the theoretical analysis framework of target detection in binocular images and depth estimation system are built according to the binocular image processing protocol specification, which can explain the mechanism for extracting and matching image features as well as estimating and optimizing the depth cycle mechanism generated by the binocular image acquisition and pre-processing model and image recognition module. In addition, from the perspective of performance changes and practical interpretation of target detection in binocular images and depth estimation, we will continue to explore the possibility of moving towards high-quality development of target detection in binocular images and depth estimation. Target detection in binocular images and depth estimation provide standard image recognition and depth perception for intelligent vision and continuously improve the quality of target detection in binocular images and depth estimation to improve users' satisfaction. Therefore, we take measures, such as enhancing the control of the binocular image recognition model based on the YOLOv8 quality inner loop, building interaction and feedback mechanism between the image acquisition module and pre-processing module, and binocular image recognition module, setting up an evaluation system for the target detection in binocular images and depth estimation.

A General Framework for Clustering and Distribution Matching With Bandit Feedback,"We develop a general framework for clustering and distribution matching problems with bandit feedback. We consider a K-armed bandit model where some subset of K arms is partitioned into M groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value  $\delta $ . Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding M pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and N-ary clustering of K arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding  $\delta $ . Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as  $\delta $  vanishes.","DesCartes Program, CNRS@CREATE, CREATE Tower, Singapore; Department of Information Systems and Analytics, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Queenstown, Singapore; Department of Mathematics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Queenstown, Singapore; Department of Computer Science, the Department of Mathematics, Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore, Queenstown, Singapore",R.

"FhGenie: A Custom, Confidentiality-Preserving Chat AI for Corporate and Scientific Use","Since OpenAI's release of ChatGPT, generative AI has received significant attention across various domains. These AI-based chat systems have the potential to enhance the productivity of knowledge workers in diverse tasks. However, the use of free public services poses a risk of data leakage, as service providers may exploit user input for additional training and optimization without clear boundaries. Even subscription-based alternatives sometimes lack transparency in handling user data. To address these concerns and enable Fraunhofer staff to leverage this technology while ensuring confidentiality, we have designed and developed a customized chat AI called FhGenie (genie being a reference to a helpful spirit). Within few days of its release, thousands of Fraunhofer employees started using this service. As pioneers in implementing such a system, many other organizations have followed suit. Our solution builds upon commercial large language models (LLMs), which we have carefully integrated into our system to meet our specific requirements and compliance constraints, including confidentiality and GDPR. In this paper, we share detailed insights into the architectural considerations, design, implementation, and subsequent updates of FhGenie. Additionally, we discuss challenges, observations, and the core lessons learned from its productive usage.","Fraunhofer Society. Headquarters, Munich, Germany; Fraunhofer Society.

An Ensemble Sentiment Classification System of Twitter Data for Airline Services Analysis: Smart Use of Soft Computing,"To perform the airline services analysis it is difficult to gather the data by means of questionnaire investigation as it is both labour and time consuming. Using information obtained from Twitter is a useful method for gathering customer feedback and enhancing services. Everyone uses social media today, therefore there are a lot of user perspectives available. Twitter social media data frequently employs confusing phrasing that makes it challenging to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments. More than a billion social media communications need to be properly kept in a database and analysed in order to interpret the data. In this study, the majority vote principle was used to guide the use of an ensemble sentiment classification technique that combined the C4.5 Decision Tree, SVM, Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms. The results show that the suggested ensemble classifier performs better than both majority voting ensemble classifiers and stand-alone classifiers. According to our findings, the ensemble approach might increase overall mining and sentiment classification performance for other services as well.","Computer Science and Engineering, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun, India; Computer Science and Engineering, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun, India; Computer Science and Engineering, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun, India; Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Graphic Era Deemed to be University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India; Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management, Nagpur, India; Computer Science and Engineering, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun, India",S.

A Virtual Ultrasonography Simulator for Skill Training Using Magnetic-Inertial Probe Tracking,"Simulation-based ultrasonography training has been proven to be effective for novice practitioners to acquire operation skills. However, existing simulators are cumbersome, expensive, and sometimes fail to provide intuitive and interactive training experience. In this article, a compact, inexpensive, and interactive ultrasonography simulator is developed using magnetic-inertial 6-degree of freedom (DoF) probe pose tracking and virtual ultrasound image generation. Embedded with magnetic and inertial sensors, the sham ultrasound probe is tracked by fusing magnetic measurement of a single electromagnet embedded in the phantom and inertial measurement of the probe. Then the virtual scan plane is determined according to the estimated probe pose to slice the digital anatomical model for virtual image generation, providing visual feedback for skill training. The probe tracking accuracy is experimentally validated to be sufficiently accurate for correct image generation with the RMS position error of 3.67 mm and average orientation error of 0.74$^\circ $. The interactive performance of the simulator is evaluated by volunteer tests, showing shortened task completion time (40.68 s versus 50.46 s) and slightly improved accuracy of reaching target views compared to the slider control method. It is also shown that an inexperienced operator can learn to successfully acquire standard and diagnostic views of fetal hearts with congenital diseases. Due to intuitive freehand interaction, accurate probe tracking, and real-time visual guidance of ultrasound images and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual scene of the probe and anatomy, the proposed simulator can provide immersive training experience for quick ultrasound skill acquirement.","Shien-Ming Wu School of Intelligent Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Shien-Ming Wu School of Intelligent Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Echocardiography Medical Center, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University Maternal-Fetal Medicine Center in Fetal Heart Disease, Beijing, China; Echocardiography Medical Center, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University Maternal-Fetal Medicine Center in Fetal Heart Disease, Beijing, China; Shien-Ming Wu School of Intelligent Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Echocardiography Medical Center, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University Maternal-Fetal Medicine Center in Fetal Heart Disease, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Management and Control of Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China",H.

"Product Success Evaluation Model Based on Star Ratings, Reviews and Product Popularity","In the era of the Internet and big data, it is of great significance to formulate product sales strategies and product improvement plans based on user evaluation data. Therefore, an evaluation system is established to calculate the index (product success index) composed of three factors: actual star rating of consumers, star rating of review analysis, and star rating of product popularity (star rating of products over time). We use AHP to determine the weights between these three factors. We then select the products we consider most successful based on the calculated product success index and found that users are most concerned about product quality, price and security. At the same time, to solve the question of whether a particular review affects subsequent ratings. We used a two-way ANOVA method to analyze whether specific reviews in the early stages would affect the stars in later stages. We found that the p-value is concentrated between 0.1-0.2, which means the specific star rating is considered to have an impact on the evaluation. Finally, we suggest that Merchants and platforms should pay more attention to the characteristics of successful products and early product feedback. The innovation of this paper is that it combines a variety of methods including systems science, management science, and statistical prediction artificial intelligence to comprehensively evaluate and predict the success of commodities, which can provide certain support for business decisions.","College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, P.

Real-Time Exam Anomaly Detection in Moodle-based Exam Systems with an AI Agent,"Online education takes a high priority in the modern world because technology is evolving so rapidly that education needs to adapt to this changing and evolving technology. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning is the only available solution to continue teaching during the lockdown periods. The evolution of these studies also needs to adapt to the situation. One of the significant issues with this online evaluation method is the anomalies during the evaluation process. This proposed implementation mainly focuses on anomaly detection of the Moodle environment exam systems. The proposed system produces a Moodle plugin to detect the time taken for each question in the Moodle environment examination system and detect the exam anomalies using the time variations. Then analyze and calculate the time that each candidate has taken for each question and the average time. The invigilator can see the candidates who took more than average time and less than average time and get the suspicious candidate list. The plugin also contains a separate algorithm that monitors the candidate while facing the exam. This face detection algorithm will notice the unusual behaviours of the candidate and upload the created report to the database, and the invigilator can access these reports on their loggings. To guide the candidate system, they also have an AI agent who will help to understand the exam process, give pre-defined answers for the questions, and provide contact details of the relevant authorities for exceptional cases. Also, the developed plugin detects the system information and background apps that run during the exam process and automatically creates relevant reports, and uploads them into the database. After the system implementation, the system was tested using a selected audience.

Learning Analytics Tools to Analyze Progress and Results With Moodle LMS Data,"Teachers can benefit from the information provided by learning analytics data for multiple purposes. Visual learning analytics dashboards provide near real-time information while more complex offline tools are commonly used to synthesize and transform the data gathered into interpretable information for teachers. The extended use of Learning Management Systems in universities, such as Moodle or Canvas, provides a rich environment to capture learning analytics data from students' interactions while they are progressing in their courses. In this paper, we present two different learning analytics tools aimed at teachers to obtain information about students' progress and results using data from the Moodle LMS at different stages of their learning process: (1) a progress visualization plugin for Moodle, which provides teachers with real-time information about the progress achieved by students in their courses, and the different goals set for their plans; and (2) an analytics Jupyter Notebook tool with a pre-defined set of analysis and visualizations to apply to data gathered from default activities in Moodle.

Automating Source Code Plagiarism Detection in a Moodle-Based Programming Course,"Plagiarism in programming courses in college is an issue. Automatic plagiarism detection tools using source code similarities are important to combat this issue. For example, Moss and JPlag tools are used worldwide by several universities for the detection of similarity in students' source codes. However, the similarity could cause lead to notification of false positives. Given the large number of students in programming courses, considering only similarity could increase the number of students that the instructors should investigate to decide whether there is plagiarism. In this context, this paper presents the ProjPlag tool that seeks to combine similarity detection results with student behavior data, such as the coding process in the learning management system (LMS) and assignment scores during the programming courses. The ProjPlag automates the utilization of Jplag and Moss tools and also analyses students' behavior by means of data extracted from the Moodle platform, the LMS used in the programming courses at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia. This paper presents an analysis of correlations between the list of confirmed plagiarized assignments with the student behavior data on the Moodle platform, such as time to implement an assignment, the remaining time from the deadline, and the assignment's score. ProjPlag was tested in two different academic semesters at the University of Brasilia in 2022 for the first programming course, (Algorithms and Computer Programming course) in the Department of Computer Science. The findings show that the detection tools can help the instructor to ascertain whether there was plagiarism or not. However, the majority of student behavior data from Moodle had limited relevance in confirming plagiarism and can generate a false alarm. The correlations between confirmed plagiarism and student's behavior (plagiarism and assignments scores, time spent coding, and project scores) on the Moodle platform were low.","Universidade de Brasília, Brasília, Brazil; Texas A&M University, College Station, US; Texas A&M University, College Station, US",R.

Decoding Students' Paths in Moodle to Distill Significance of Learning Resources,"In learning management systems, like Moodle, log files containing data on students' learning paths offer insights into how students interact with their tutors, peers, and the provided educational material. This study focused on 152 postgraduate students using Moodle in an Open University, engaging with a specific module in the 2021-2022 academic year. Analysis of their log files aimed to correlate learning path states with final grades, providing insights for optimizing the learning process, tutor guidance, and course structure. Markov Chain Models were used to analyze students' navigation and transitions between seven states in Moodle. Results indicated a predominant engagement with the Course and Forum states, suggesting the university platform emphasizes content delivery and collaborative learning. Measures such as Entropy, Frobenius Norm, Euclidean Distance, and Cosine Similarity were used to assess data patterns and relationships. Variations in probabilities among states made this study challenging to differentiate students' academic performance in the specific module, based on eigenvectors and the above metrics alone. The diverse range of features, activities, and interactions within Moodle results in data patterns that may not always have straightforward interpretations.","School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece; School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece; School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece; School of Science & Technology, International Hellenic University, Thessaloniki, Greece; School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece; School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece",E.

Enhancing Online Learning in LCM Moodle through Interactive Adaptive Learning,"The article considers the practical experience of introducing interactive adaptive learning in the e-learning environment. The basis of the learning environment is the LCM Moodle learning resource management system. One of the ways to individualize and personalize the learning process is to attract interactive and adaptive technologies for teaching students. The LCM Moodle’s interactive module of activity “Lesson’’ is a series of HTML pages linked by transitions. The main difference between “Lesson’’ and other LCM Moodle modules is that there are elements of adaptability. Using this tool, each student’s choice can be accompanied by appropriate comments from the teacher and the ability to go to different pages of the course depending on the correctness/incorrectness and completeness of the answers. With such planning, “Lesson’’ can provide theoretical material and control tasks to check its mastery for each student automatically, without additional action by the teacher. As a result of completing the tasks, the corresponding score appears in the student’s register of marks. In general, this module of activity is similar to a classroom lesson, when the teacher, presenting new material, from time to time interviews students in order to identify the level of its mastery.","Department of Computer Science and Teaching Methods, Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University, Ternopil, Ukraine; Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University, Ternopil, Ukraine; Department of Theory and Practice of Translation, Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University, Ternopi, Ukraine; Department of Computer Science and Teaching Methods, Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University, Ternopil, Ukraine; Licensing and accreditation department, Kyiv International University, Kyiv, Ukraine; Department of Computer Science and Teaching Methods, Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University, Ternopil, Ukraine",V.

A Dialogue Response Generation Model With Latent Variable Modeling and LWE Attention Based on the VW-BLEU Evaluation Metric,"In this page, We propose a novel dialogue response generation model that combines BART-large models with latent variable modeling and the Latent Weight Enhanced (LWE) Attention mechanism to improve the performance of dialogue response generation. Dialogue systems are increasingly utilized in various domains, such as customer service, medical consultations, and personal assistants. In these applications, generating natural and consistent responses is a critical challenge. However, existing models often struggle to maintain long-term dialogue coherence or capture hidden meanings and inferential relationships within conversations. To address these limitations, this research presents enhanced modeling techniques based on the Learning to Memorize Entailment and Discourse Relations (LMEDR) framework, effectively capturing contextual consistency and inferential relationships in dialogue. Additionally, a new evaluation metric, Vocabulary-Weighted BLEU (VW-BLEU), is introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional BLEU scores by assessing response diversity and naturalness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance on traditional metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. In addition, our model exhibits higher lexical diversity as reflected by improved Distinct-1 (2.79 vs. 2.47) and Distinct-2 (14.95 vs. 13.82) scores and a significant boost in persona consistency with a Consistency Score of 39.41 compared to 25.31 from the state-of-the-art LMEDR. Furthermore, on the DSTC7-AVSD dataset, our model yields improvements of 13.4% in BLEU and 12.3% in METEOR, confirming its ability to generate responses with enhanced lexical richness and contextual fluency, as further validated by high VW-BLEU scores","Department of Computer Software, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Computer Software, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea",J.

A Study on How to Classify Exercises in Introductory Programming Courses: A Moodle Plugin Contribution,"This full paper reports the results of the development of a Moodle plugin, Programming Exercise Teaching Assistant (PETA), created to support teachers from introductory programming courses to identify problematic exercises by analyzing how students interact with them. Moodle is an open source learning management system that allows personalization of its functionality through plugins. In introductory programming courses, it is common to propose problems to students, for which they need to elaborate solution code. The VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) is a popular plugin that allows teachers to create this kind of problem, with automatic evaluation built on top of test-cases. The iAssign (interactive Assignment) is another plugin of the same sort, but with block-based programming. Our plugin is an open-source project, initially developed to integrate with iAssign, and created to integrate easily with any similar plugin used in programming tasks. Our primary goal is to empower teachers and students by supplying a tool that improves the quality of programming in education. Over the last few years, the University of São Paulo has increased its public policy for social inclusion, bringing in even more learners with diverse educational backgrounds. Understanding the students' profiles and being able to modify problems based on these new contexts is fundamental to improve the quality of teaching. This plugin aims to meet the needs of teachers and learners, exploring data from their educational context to improve the learning experience. The plugin automatically extracts data from students' interaction with the coding exercise, e.g. the time between submission (TBS), code changing between submissions (CCBS), and grades. Using these variables, we calculated derived metrics in an attempt to classify exercises according to different parameters. First, we considered time-related metrics, the highest time between submissions (HT). Secondly, we evaluated metrics related to code changes, the highest code changes between submissions (HC). Finally, we accounted for student performance by considering average grades, penalized by time and by number of submissions (AG). A technical contribution of this work is the Moodle plugin that analyzes the students' codes of iAssign, available as free software. The results from this new plugin with eight introductory classes show that it was possible to classify exercises. The AG metric created could be associated with the exercise level of difficulty, while HT and HC metrics are indicative of exercise complexity, requiring a higher level of prior knowledge, such as familiarity with loops, functions, and potential challenges with the problem instructions.","University of São Paulo, Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, São Paulo, Brazil; University of São Paulo, Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, São Paulo, Brazil; University of São Paulo, Institute of Physics, São Paulo, Brazil",T.

Impact of Moodle’s Usability on Student Satisfaction in Sri Lankan Universities,"This research investigates the usability of Moodle, a widely used Learning Management System (LMS), in Sri Lankan universities, and its impact on student satisfaction. The study evaluates four key usability dimensions Learnability, Effectiveness, Information Quality, and Accessibility using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) on data collected from 117 student responses. The analysis identifies that Accessibility, Effectiveness, and Information Quality significantly influence student satisfaction, with Accessibility emerging as the most influential factor. This is attributed to its critical role in ensuring device compatibility and seamless navigation. Interestingly, Learnability did not show a statistically significant impact, suggesting that ease of learning Moodle’s functionalities does not directly contribute to overall satisfaction. The findings underscore the complex nature of LMS usability and the importance of adapting platform features to enhance user experience. Recommendations are provided for improving Moodle’s accessibility and effectiveness, which are key to fostering student engagement and satisfaction. This research contributes to understanding the critical usability factors that influence the digital learning experience in higher education.","Department of Industrial Management, Faculty of Science, University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya, SriLanka; Department of Industrial Management, Faculty of Science, University of Kelaniya, Kelaniya, SriLanka",A.

PromotionLens: Inspecting Promotion Strategies of Online E-commerce via Visual Analytics,"Promotions are commonly used by e-commerce merchants to boost sales. The efficacy of different promotion strategies can help sellers adapt their offering to customer demand in order to survive and thrive. Current approaches to designing promotion strategies are either based on econometrics, which may not scale to large amounts of sales data, or are spontaneous and provide little explanation of sales volume. Moreover, accurately measuring the effects of promotion designs and making bootstrappable adjustments accordingly remains a challenge due to the incompleteness and complexity of the information describing promotion strategies and their market environments. We present PromotionLens, a visual analytics system for exploring, comparing, and modeling the impact of various promotion strategies. Our approach combines representative multivariant time-series forecasting models and well-designed visualizations to demonstrate and explain the impact of sales and promotional factors, and to support “what-if” analysis of promotions.

When NLP meets SDN : an application to Global Internet eXchange Network,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and its extension Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are network paradigms that enable dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration. IBN allows network operators to express an outcome or business objective without the low-level configurations necessary to program the network to achieve these demands. Existing research proposals for IBN introduce several systems to translate users intents into network infrastructure configurations. Despite the positive aspects of these proposals, they still suffer from many drawbacks. Some require users to learn a new intent definition language. Some others may lack the appropriate grammar to make these frameworks recognize the intent correctly. In this paper, we introduce a framework leveraging the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for network management from an operator utterances. In order to understand natural language, our framework uses the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning model based on recurrent neural networks (LSTM). The model has been improved by using word embedding and user feedback. As a proof of concept, we implement our framework for network management in a Global Internet eXchange Network and evaluate its practicality regarding NLP accuracy and network performance.","School of Information and Communication Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam; TexPECT, France; School of Information and Communication Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam; LISSI-TincNET Research Team, University Paris-Est Creteil, France",M. -T. -A.

Implementing a Learning Record Warehouse for Different Interoperability Specifications in Moodle LMS,"Semantic interoperability is an important aspect in Learning Analytics systems, allowing data from various sources to be processed by a central application while preserving its original meaning. In this regard, there are two specifications that enable interoperability for Learning Analytics: Caliper Analytics and the Experience API (xAPI). This study presents the implementation of a Learning Record Warehouse (LRW) for storing Moodle logs, using the specifications Caliper Analytics and xAPI. OpenLRW was chosen as the platform to store data collected by plugins responsible for gathering Moodle logs in Caliper Analyzer and xAPI formats. Despite OpenLRW having an internal converter to convert data from xAPI to Caliper Analyzer format, some bottlenecks were identified during the experiments conducted within this study.","Centro de Desenvolvimento Tecnológico, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brasil; Facultad de Ingenierias, Universidad de Medellin, Medellin, Colombia; Depto. de Engenharia do Conhecimento, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brasil; Escuela de Ingenieria Informática, Universidad de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; Coord.

Design and Optimization of PID Controller based on Metaheuristic algorithms for Hybrid Robots,"Metaheuristics optimization techniques are significant to search methods that are used to solve challenging Artificial intelligence (AI) problems. In hybrid robot control systems, Meta-heuristic optimization methods are widely applied. The major goal of this paper is to develop optimized PID control parameters to improve the performance of the hybrid robot control system. For that purpose, two optimization techniques followed by fine-tuning are proposed and simulated to get the optimized PID parameters. The first proposed optimization method applies the Satin Bowerbird (SB) optimization technique to optimize the PID parameters. The Crow Search Optimization (CSO) technique is applied to the SB results to improve the algorithm's performance and the PID parameters. The second proposed method applies the Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO) technique for the optimization of the PID parameters. The results of both methods are fine-tuned. Moreover, a Kalman filter is used to improve the outcomes after and before tuning the PID parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed first method is more effective for the optimization methods of the PID controller, and its results outperform the results given by previously published research.","The Higher Institute for Management and Information Technology, Minya, Egypt; Faculty of Engineering, Minya University, Minya, Egypt; College of Engineering, Effat University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",R.

On the Benefits of Sensorimotor Regularities as Design Constraints for Superpower Interactions in Mixed Reality,"Mixed Reality (MR) systems enable users to perform augmented superpowers that transcend real-world limitations. However, it remains unclear what types of action-outcome mappings can enable users to easily learn, control, and feel a sense of ownership of these augmented superpowers. Humans develop a set of sensorimotor regularities (i.e., image schemas and lawful relations between them) from recurring bodily experiences since early infancy, and use them to predict the outcome of our actions, or choose actions based on the desired outcome. We investigate whether sensorimotor regularities (SRs) can serve as effective design constraints for superpower interactions, by comparing three temporal manipulation methods in MR games: (1) mid-air button control; (2) gestures incongruent with SRs embedded in the concept of temporal manipulation; and (3) gestures congruent with these SRs. A within-subject study with 18 participants reveals that the SRs-congruent method enables significantly improved task performance, lower overall workload, and a greater sense of agency and presence compared to both an SRs-incongruent method and a mid-air button-based method. The SRs-congruent method also enabled faster mastery of the augmented superpower. No significant difference was observed in any of the above-mentioned metrics between the SRs-incongruent and mid-air button-based methods. These results empirically demonstrate multiple benefits of SRs as design constraints for superpower controls in MR, and encourage future research to explore their wider applicability in superpower interaction design.","University of Cambridge, UK; University of Cambridge, UK",J.

This paper presents UBUMonitor, a desktop application that allows the visualization of student’s activity data, extended as a proof of concept with a module for dropout tracking. Therefore, by using UBUMonitor, teachers will be able to easily visualize their students’ engagement with their subject, which can facilitate early action to prevent students from dropping out more effectively.","Centro de Enseñanza Virtual, Hospital Militar, Universidad de Burgos, Burgos, Spain; Departamento de Ingeniería Informática, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad de Burgos, Burgos, Spain; Departamento de Ingeniería Informática, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad de Burgos, Burgos, Spain; Departamento de Ingeniería Informática, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad de Burgos, Burgos, Spain; Departamento de Ingeniería Informática, Escuela Politécnica Superior, Universidad de Burgos, Burgos, Spain",Y.

Data-Driven Modeling Through the Moodle Learning Management System: An Empirical Study Based on a Mathematics Teaching Subject,"This work addresses the problem of inferring student performance from information acquired in a Learning Management System (LMS). In particular, we explore the capabilities offered by Moodle, a widely used LMS. The study is performed on data acquired from four classes within the same subject, for whom we make inferences about student performance marks. The developed methodology describes the degree in which the acquired information allows to predict the student marks belonging to the continuous evaluation, while the prediction of the final students marks has a higher intrinsic complexity that would require a more in- depth study of the relevant variables. Then, we follow a fully data-driven process to discover similarities among classes. In particular, we propose the use of a dependence estimation measure, the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence criterion. We show how this dependence measure is useful to determine relations among classes, based on their particular teaching methodology, by only using data acquired from the LMS. This opens the door to explore the capabilities of LMS in similarity search between offered courses along an educational platform. In order to help the community and serve as a common way of comparison, we provide the source code of the proposed methodology.","Departament de Didàctica de la Matemàtica, Universitat de València, València, Spain; Departamento de Matemáticas, Estadística y Computación, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain; Departament de Didàctica de la Matemàtica, Universitat de València, València, Spain; Image Processing Laboratory (IPL), Universitat de València, València, Spain; Departament d’Informàtica, Universitat de València, València, Spain",A.

Automating the Comparison of Learning Design and Delivery Using Course Scaffolding in Moodle,"Learning analytics from an LMS combined with design analytics from a learning design (LD) tool provide a foundation for checking the alignment of a course's LD and its delivery. For students to achieve the intended learning outcomes, a theoretically founded and innovative LD is essential. The next step is the orchestration of course delivery according to the prepared LD; however, due to real-life circumstances, delivery can deviate from the plan. Therefore, it is important to compare LD and delivery, identify potential differences, justify them, or redesign the course. In this comparison process, it is necessary to evaluate constructive alignment and assessment validity. These processes are described in the paper, along with their automation using the Balanced Design Planning (BDP) concept and tool for LD. The most significant achievement in this direction is the automatic scaffolding of a course in the open LMS Moodle directly from the BDP LD tool. This scaffolding functionality forms the basis for the development of an algorithm for the comparison of course LD and delivery.","Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb, Varaždin, Croatia; Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb, Varaždin, Croatia; Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb, Varaždin, Croatia; Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb, Varaždin, Croatia",B.

The Experimental Introduction of Moodle Online Quizzes in a C# Basic Programming Course,"Developing and keeping the students' motivation throughout the course seems to be key issues for teaching programming. In light of this viewpoint, we introduced Moodle online quizzes to our C# basic programming course for the first-year students. We found that gamification can motivate students easily at the beginning, but it is difficult to keep their motivation. For some students, online quizzes successfully developed their motivation and kept it throughout the course. We understand that they are motivated intrinsically. However, for some other students, online quizzes led to less motivation, because they felt the quizzes were too difficult. Additionally, we found that some students kept their motivation to some extent, and resulted in low scores. We understand that they are motivated only externally. When the difficulty of quizzes was adjusted to a student level, which means that he/she can find the answer with a little effort using the knowledge acquired so far, the quizzes can motivate the student intrinsically.","Faculty of Information Technology, Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand; Faculty of Information Technology, Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand",M.

QAQA-SS: An Improved Fuzzing Approach with Seed Scheduling Based on the UCB Algorithm for QA Systems,"Question Answering (QA) system is a type of artificial intelligence application designed to comprehend natural language questions and provide accurate, meaningful natural language answers. However, there are errors in the QA system, which can cause inconvenience for users and even lead to economic losses and security issues. In response to these challenges, QAQA showed up. QAQA designs several metamorphic relations (MRs) and achieves precise automatic testing through semantic-guided search and enhanced test oracles. However, QAQA fairly selects each seed (initial test input) in sequential order and assigns them a fixed number of mutations, which leaves many seeds that could produce quality test inputs neglected. This paper proposes an improved version named QAQA-SS (QAQA-Seed Schedule), where we enhance QAQA with a seed scheduling module and a fuzzing framework featuring iterative feedback. We combine the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm with perplexity to devise a novel seed scheduling algorithm. QAQA-SS selects superior seeds and allocates appropriate mutation counts (energy) to generate more error-inducing test inputs within a limited energy budget. Additionally, we introduce a text paraphrasing operation to improve the performance of finding errors in the QA system. We conducted experiments following the experimental setup of QAQA on three datasets: BoolQ, SQuAD2, and NarrativeQA. Our experimental results reveal a noteworthy enhancement in the error discovery rate for QAQA-SS, achieving 81,777 error discoveries compared to 64,354 error discoveries with QAQA.","School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China; School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China; School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China; School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China; School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China",J.

Automated Plagiarism Detection in Moodle,"The digital revolution has made access to information very easy. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic also called for further digitization. Every organization; be it an office, an educational institute or a government entity, was forced to shift to an all virtual mode of operation. This led to the conduct of online examinations with very little time for formulating an anti-cheating examination pattern. Audio and video proctoring tools are considered helpful but are very expensive and do not provide a method to detect plagiarism in the handwritten text. This is a serious problem for academic enterprises and institutes where there is a need for plagiarism detection in the submitted assignments, answer-scripts against the information available on the Internet as well as against other submissions.

A Cross-Period Network for Clothing Change Person Re-Identification,"Pedestrian re-identification aims to identify the same target pedestrian among multiple non-overlapping cameras. However, in real scenarios, pedestrians often change their clothing features due to external factors such as weather and seasons, rendering traditional methods reliant on consistent clothing features ineffective. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Driven Cross-Period Network for Clothing Change Person Re-Identification, comprising three key components: 1) Knowledge-Driven Topology Inference Network: Leveraging knowledge graphs and graph convolution networks, this network captures spatio-temporal information between camera nodes. Knowledge embedding is introduced into the graph convolution network for effective topology inference; 2) Cross-Period Clothing Change Network: This network aggregates spatio-temporal information for clothing generation. By utilizing overall pedestrian clothing characteristics whthin logical topology cameras, it mitigates matching errors caused by external factors; and 3) Joint Optimization Mechanism: A collaborative approach involving both the topology inference network and cross-period clothing change network. Multi-camera logical topology offers auxiliary information and retrieval order for the clothing change network, while pedestrian re-identification results provide feedback to adjust the logical topology. Experimental analysis on datasets Celeb-ReID, PRCC, UJS-ReID, SLP, and DukeMTMC-ReID, demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed model in addressing the challenges of pedestrian re-identification in scenarios involving changing clothing features.","School of Management, Guangdong University of Science and Technology, Dongguan, China; School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China; Faculty of Electrical, Information and Communication Engineering, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan; School of Intelligent Information Engineering, Guangdong Vocational College of Hotel Management, Dongguan, China; School of Public Affairs, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China",S.

Low-Cost Smart Learning with Moodle-Based Raspberry Pi 4 for University Students,"Electronic learning (E-learning) has been a popular trend in education in recent years. As the cornerstone of E-Learning., the learning management system (LMS) must be available 24/7 with strong internet connectivity, enabling students to engage in paperless learning. However, not all universities, especially those in rural areas, have reliable internet connectivity. This has become an issue for universities that lack reliable internet connectivity and an adequate computer laboratory since they are unable to offer an E-learning environment that simulates a classroom setting. Even though the majority of students and teachers have smartphones, without reliable internet connectivity, it will be challenging to establish a connection to the learning management system's remote server. In this paper, a mobile learning management system based on Raspberry Pi and MoodleBox has been developed to address the aforementioned E-learning problem. This prototype can be used locally as a server even without an internet connection to provide the most fundamental LMS features. Students can view the information locally from their smartphone or laptop after teachers submit it to this portable system.

Blockchain-Enabled Multiple Sensitive Task-Offloading Mechanism for MEC Applications,"As mobile devices proliferate and mobile applications diversify, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become widely adopted to efficiently allocate computing resources at the network edge and alleviate network congestion. In the MEC initial phase, the absence of vital information presents challenges in devising task-offloading policies, and identifying malicious devices responsible for providing inaccurate feedback is complex. To fill in such gaps, we introduce a consortium blockchain-enabled Committee Voting based Task Offloading Model (CVTOM) to collaboratively formulate resource allocation policies and establish deterrence against malicious servers producing erroneous results intentionally. Different voting principle mechanisms of each committee member are first designed in a Blockchain-enabled system which helps to represent the system's resource status. Additionally, we propose a Multi-armed Bandits related Thompson Sampling based Adaptive Preference Optimization (TSAPO) algorithm for task-offloading policy, enhancing the timely identification of potent edge servers to improve computing resource utilization which first considers dynamic edge server space and parallel computing scenarios. The solid proof process greatly contributes to the theoretical analysis of the TSAPO.

Data-Augmentation for Bangla-English Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis: Enhancing Cross Linguistic Contextual Understanding,"In today’s digital world, automated sentiment analysis from online reviews can contribute to a wide variety of decision-making processes. One example is examining typical perceptions of a product based on customer feedbacks to have a better understanding of consumer expectations, which can help enhance everything from customer service to product offerings. Online review comments, on the other hand, frequently mix different languages, use non-native scripts and do not adhere to strict grammar norms. For a low-resource language like Bangla, the lack of annotated code-mixed data makes automated sentiment analysis more challenging. To address this, we collect online reviews of different products and construct an annotated Bangla-English code mix (BE-CM) dataset (Dataset and other resources are available at https://github.com/fokhruli/CM-seti-anlysis). On our sentiment corpus, we also compare several alternative models from the existing literature. We present a simple but effective data augmentation method that can be utilized with existing word embedding algorithms without the need for a parallel corpus to improve cross-lingual contextual understanding. Our experimental results suggest that training word embedding models (e.g., Word2vec, FastText) with our data augmentation strategy can help the model in capturing the cross-lingual relationship for code-mixed sentences, thereby improving the overall performance of existing classifiers in both supervised learning and zero-shot cross-lingual adaptability. With extensive experimentations, we found that XGBoost with Fasttext embedding trained on our proposed data augmentation method outperforms other alternative models in automated sentiment analysis on code-mixed Bangla-English dataset, with a weighted F1 score of 87%.","Department of Accounting and Information Systems, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Banking and Insurance, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh",M.

Using Moodle Test Scores to Predict Success in an Online Course,"Many higher education institutions use a free, open-source learning management system (LMS) called Moodle that provides all the necessary tools for teachers to create virtual classrooms using the Internet. In this environment, teachers request reports detailing which course resources and activities learners accessed, including access times. Therefore, teachers can check individual student performance, whether students viewed a particular resource or participated in some activities in a certain period, based on reports known as log files. This paper deals with the analysis of data based on the scores of student online tests obtained using Moodle log files. Based of the collected data, which contain student data of the first year of undergraduate study Introduction to Programming at the University of Split, Faculty of Science and Mathematics in Croatia, pre-processing and export analysis of the data is carried out. Furthermore, prediction methods that include machine learning algorithms are used to predict student's final grade. It was shown that the highest accuracy of 82.35%, AUC and Cohen kappa with values of 0.766 and 0.706 were achieved with the Linear SVC algorithm for predicting student's performance. However, the challenge we faced is the lack of data, where three ways to achieve the most accurate performance model are presented. Also, we examined importance of considering significant attributes that influence student performance prediction results.","Data Science and Engineering, Faculty of Science, Split, Croatia; Data Science and Engineering, Faculty of Science, Split, Croatia; Data Science and Engineering, Faculty of Science, Split, Croatia; Data Science and Engineering, Faculty of Science, Split, Croatia",D.

A System of Software Tools for Investigation of the Cognitive Function of Elliptical Sentence Generation,"A human ability for elliptical sentence generation is actively investigated in the past few decades. This ability means that a person can shorten some words in a sentence without a lost in its content, and these words can be clearly restored. However, we have not found yet any testing materials or computer tests to test this cognitive function. Previously, we presented some testing materials. In this paper, a system of software tools is presented and the results of a pilot student testing are discussed. Software tools consist of a desktop application for searching ellipses and Moodle questions generation and a system of plugins for Moodle. Moodle plugins present a new type of Quiz question. We can use these plugins not only for ellipses-based testing but also for any kind of (foreign, programming) language learning. The plugins present a task, where a interviewee should search and cross out some odd words. Some geometry tasks are adopted as testing materials.","Medical academy, St. Petersburg, Russia; Peter the Great, St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia; Peter the Great, St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia; Peter the Great, St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia; Medical academy, St. Petersburg, Russia; Medical academy, St. Petersburg, Russia",X.

Scanning the Literature,"The 6G wireless system is expected to deliver faster and more reliable wireless connections via cutting-edge radio technologies. However, a pivot to these radio technologies is the effective management of large-scale antenna arrays, which aims to construct valid spatial streams to maximize system throughput. In this paper, the authors explored generative artificial intelligence to accurately model the environment particularly for radio simulations and identify valid paths within it for real-time spatial-channel state information (CSI) prediction. Different from the traditional management methods that predominantly rely on user feedback to adapt to dynamic wireless channels, the proposed approach lies in the prediction of spatial-CSI which is a channel characterization that consists of all robust line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths between the transmitter and receiver, with three-di-mensional (3D) trajectory, attenuation, phase shift, delay, and polarization of each path. The authors argued that by exploiting the multi-path effect, it can enhance the spatial capabilities of wire-less channels using antenna arrays and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations for 6G wireless communication technologies.",,,10.1109/MWC.2024.10702538,,1558-0687,IEEE Wireless Communications,2024,False

When User Experience Design Meets LMS Desktop Users: How to Mitigate Mobile-Oriented Interface?,"User experience design (UX design) of Learning Management Systems (LMS) is recently becoming more mobile device oriented, since large numbers of users are using mobile devices (smartphones primarily) to access learning content and activities. In this paper we will give an overview of device and platform use at the large HEI in Croatia (Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb), based on 3-year survey of first year undergraduate students (over 2100 respondents) as well as the possible steps to mitigate the issues with the mobile-oriented LMS interface (Moodle 4.x) when used on desktop devices. While move to the mobile-oriented interface design is helping most of the users, some of the teachers and content creators, who by default need to use desktop devices (PCs and laptops) have experienced certain issues with LMS usage: too large fonts and icons (designed for touchscreen and small screen devices), several features and navigation elements no longer initially visible (needs for additional interface clicks and new menus) and so on. Most of those issues could be mitigated using customized interface themes and modifications, but some require organizational and methodical changes that we will discuss in detail.","Department for Information and Communication Sciences, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, E-learning Support Center, Zagreb, Croatia",M.

Students perceptions about the use of Studium as a tool for implementing Blended Learning,"Advances in the Knowledge Society and the evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have led to great advances in different spheres of action. Regarding the academic, ICTs have enabled important transformations in teaching and learning processes. In the academic year 2021-22, two years after of the beginning of the COVID pandemic, the Spanish Ministry of Universities, and the Crue Spanish Universities, agree to carry out the safe face-to-face format that implies the implementation of blended learning or b-learning or hybrid learning. This article describes the perceptions about the use of Studium as a blended learning tool that 143 Spanish University students. An adapted version of the last section of the Innovative Methodology Assessment instrument by García et al. (2008) is used, which is designed through Google Forms. The results show that the students consider that the use of Studium in the subject has facilitated the acquisition of new knowledge, while it has allowed them to be more autonomous and responsible for their learning and work in an appropriate way. In addition, they state that they feel comfortable with such use. And they also state that it is very likely that, in other countries, they are using said web tool. Despite all the above, they also affirm that the use of this tool in the teaching and learning processes requires a lot of time, and that, in a certain way, it makes it difficult to acquire teamwork skills. Considering these results, the academic implications of using the institutional Moodle, Studium, in the teaching and learning processes of Higher Education to implement the new approach, blended learning, considering gender and the degree.","Dept. of Developmental and Educational Psychology, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, España; Dept. of General and Specific Didactics and Theory of Education, Universidad de León, León, España",J.

Optimizing Language Model-Based Educational Assistants Using Knowledge Graphs: Integration With Moodle LMS,"Chatbots in educational settings have grown significantly, facilitating interaction between students and learning platforms. However, current systems, such as Rasa, Moodle Integrated Chatbots, and ChatterBot, present significant limitations in precision, adaptability, and response time, affecting their effectiveness in resolving academic queries and personalizing learning. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes the development of an advanced educational chatbot that combines large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs, allowing for more accurate and contextualized responses and offering valuable suggestions to enrich the learning process. The system is evaluated based on its ability to adjust to different student profiles and offer fast and accurate responses. The results show that the proposed chatbot achieves a precision of 85%, outperforming Rasa and ChatterBot, which achieved accuracies of 83% and 81%, respectively. Furthermore, the chatbot reduces response times to 0.41 seconds, improving efficiency compared to other solutions. The system also demonstrates adaptability, effectively adjusting to students’ learning styles and academic levels. This work indicates that knowledge graph integration and hyperparameter optimization are crucial to improving educational chatbots’ precision, speed, and adaptability, presenting an innovative solution that overcomes the limitations of current systems.","Escuela de Ingeniería en Ciberseguridad, FICA, Universidad de Las Américas, Quito, Ecuador; Escuela de Ingeniería en Ciberseguridad, FICA, Universidad de Las Américas, Quito, Ecuador; Escuela de Ingeniería en Ciberseguridad, FICA, Universidad de Las Américas, Quito, Ecuador",W.

RecPlugin: New Functionality for Learning Resources Recommendation,"Since Corona Virus pandemic, most supervisors are oriented to teach online. Learners follow learning Resources (LR) not only those provided by their supervisors but also those available on different platforms (LMS, MOOC, SPOOC, youtube etc.). In this respect, learners may be disoriented and face cognitive overload. The tremendous volume of available LR poses significant challenges to learners in selecting LR that satisfy their interests (courses, activities, webinars, etc.) and that are complementary to their training. For this reason, we are interested in this paper, in enhancing Moodle by integrating a new plugin for learning resource recommendation. The most prominent challenge of this work is to provide to academics and researchers a plugin that is entirely free, improvable and shareable.","MIRACL Laboratory, Sfax University, Tunisia; Faculty of Sciences of Sfax, Sfax University, Tunisia; MIRACL Laboratory, Monastir University, Tunisia; L3i Laboratory, La Rochelle University, France",C.

SwiftQuiz - An interactive module to help teachers swiftly create questions and get rich feedback,"Student Response System (SRS) has been used to support teachers in engaging students live in the classroom. Prominent learning management systems such as Moodle have implemented such SRS. However, the current tools are too limited to effectively support the blended learning model, especially in retaining students' attention. Through comprehensive data analysis, we identified existing issues in the current SRS, primarily related to the feedback mechanism for students' answers, limited question types, nonintuitive feedback reports, and a lack of flexibility in impromptu question creation. In order to address these challenges, we have developed SwiftQuiz, which offers instructors the ability to create instantaneous questions, thereby improving teaching efficiency and eliminating unnecessary complexities. Furthermore, SwiftQuiz enables the creation of short-answer questions with two visual response options: Word Cloud and bar graph. Moreover, for multiple-choice question and other question types, SwiftQuiz provides a detailed data visualization of student answers, empowering educators with valuable insights into live classroom management and student engagement. By incorporating SwiftQuiz into blended classes, educators can significantly enhance classroom flexibility and engage students more interactively in the learning process. The comprehensive and user-friendly features of SwiftQuiz make it a valuable tool for supporting modern teaching methodologies within the digital learning environment.","School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China; School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China; School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China; School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China; Academy of Future Education, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China; School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China",X.

Implementation of Gamification to Enhance Understanding of Personal Data Protection based on Republic of Indonesia Law Number 27 of 2022,"The continuous development of the digital world and the increasing use of the internet have not been matched by the public's awareness of the importance of protecting personal data to prevent misuse by irresponsible individuals. The protection of personal data is regulated in the Republic of Indonesia Law Number 27 of the Year 2022 concerning Personal Data Protection (PDP Law), which needs to be understood by the Indonesian society. Therefore, in this research, a gamification about personal data protection is developed and implemented in the form of a Learning Management System (LMS) on the Moodle platform, focusing on participants according to the Core Drive in the Octalysis Gamification Framework. The results of this study show the use of gamification in understanding personal data protection using the Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design method.

AEML: An Acceleration Engine for Multi-GPU Load-Balancing in Distributed Heterogeneous Environment,"For the rapid growth computation requirements in big data and artificial intelligence area, CPU-GPU heterogeneous clusters can provide more powerful computing capacity compared to CPU clusters. The high parallel computing capabilities of GPUs greatly accelerate computation-intensive applications. And the number of GPUs on single computing node is scalable, which greatly improves the computing capacity of the cluster under the condition of limited cluster size. However, there is a lack of the effective load-balancing scheduling model in multi-GPU hardware environment. This article proposes AEML, an acceleration engine for multi-GPU load-balancing in distributed heterogeneous environment. AEML can effectively integrate GPUs into distributed processing framework and achieve great load-balance among multiple heterogeneous GPUs. We propose a heterogeneous task execution model based on multiple GPUs and multiple streams (MGMS), which can effectively balance the workload of multiple GPUs. MGMS model utilizes four core techniques: a fine-grained task mapping mechanism, a device resource unified management scheme, a novel resource-aware GPU task scheduling strategy, and a feedback-based streams adjustment scheme. The implementation of AEML system is based on Spark 3.0.0 and NVIDIA CUDA 10.0. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of AEML with multiple typical benchmarks. Experimental results show that AEML can fully exploit the computing power of GPUs and achieve great load-balance among multiple heterogeneous GPUs.","College of Information Science and Engineering, National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China; School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China; College of Information Science and Engineering, National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan University, Changsha, China",Z.

Data-Driven Anomaly Detection and Event Log Profiling of SCADA Alarms,"Network human operators’ decision-making during grid outages requires significant attention and the ability to perceive real-time feedback from multiple information sources to minimize the number of control actions required to restore service, while maintaining the system and people safety. Data-driven event and alarm management have the potential to reduce human operator cognitive burden. However, the high complexity of events, the data semantics, and the large variety of equipment and technologies are key barriers for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to raw SCADA data. In this context, this paper proposes a methodology to convert a large volume of alarm events into data mining terminology, creating the conditions for the application of modern AI techniques to alarm data. Moreover, this work also proposes two novel data-driven applications based on SCADA data: (i) identification of anomalous behaviors regarding the performance of the protection relays of primary substations, during circuit breaker tripping alarms in High Voltage (HV) and Medium Voltage (MV) lines; (ii) unsupervised learning to cluster similar events in HV line panels, classify new event logs based on the obtained clusters and membership grade with a control parameter that helps to identify rare events. Important aspects associated with data handling and pre-processing are also covered. The results for real data from a Distribution System Operator (DSO) showed: (i) that the proposed method can detect unexpected relay pickup events, e.g., one substation with nearly 41% of the circuit breaker alarms had an ‘atypical’ event in their context (revealed an overlooked problem on the electrification of a protection relay); (ii) capability to automatically detect and group issues into specific clusters, e.g., SF6 low-pressure alarms and blocks with abnormal profiles caused by event time-delay problems.","INESC Technology and Science (INESC TEC), Porto, Portugal; INESC Technology and Science (INESC TEC), Porto, Portugal; INESC Technology and Science (INESC TEC), Porto, Portugal; INESC Technology and Science (INESC TEC), Porto, Portugal; INESC Technology and Science (INESC TEC), Porto, Portugal; INESC Technology and Science (INESC TEC), Porto, Portugal; E-REDES, Lisbon, Portugal; E-REDES, Lisbon, Portugal; E-REDES, Lisbon, Portugal; E-REDES, Lisbon, Portugal; E-REDES, Lisbon, Portugal",J.

How to Improve Test Performance by Moodle Statistics,"Creation of properly balanced tests and their evaluation is an important part of the educational process, which is dealt with by the theory of testing. The most popular testing theories are Classical test theory and Item response theory. In this paper, we will focus on metrics used in the Item response theory, which deals with evaluating the performance of the test from the point of view of individual questions, through metrics such as the Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Random score estimate, and others. In the 2023/2024 academic term, 239 second-year students in the field of computer science participated in the Operating Systems course. After passing each test, we proceeded to evaluate the test performance based on the statistics available in the MoodIe system. We evaluated a total of 41 testing items, primarily focused on Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Intended weight and Efficiency weight. We identified 5 testing items, which do not perform well enough. In order to be able to evaluate the overall test performance, we decided to calculate the reliability of the test using the Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR20) metric. KR20 metric is used to measure the internal consistency reliability of a test. We calculated the KR20 value before adjusting all three tests, and also after adjusting the tests. In all three cases there was an improvement in the value of KR20 in the interval from 3.63% to 5.37%, which indicates higher internal consistency of all three tests. Conclusion: We evaluated test performance of 3 tests based on the MoodIe statistics.

A Proposed Model for Improving the Reliability of Online Exam Results Using Blockchain,"In recent times, Learning Management Systems (LMS) have gained significant popularity, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, offering improved effectiveness and efficiency. Within LMS, online exams have emerged as a critical tool for assessing students’ performance and understanding of course material, playing a vital role in determining their progression. Ensuring the reliability and transparency of online exam results is imperative. Any vulnerability, such as hacking, can adversely impact students’ grades. Conventional online exam systems often store data centrally in databases like MySQL, making them susceptible to unauthorized access and manipulation. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework to enable secure and peer-to-peer conduction and evaluation of academic exams. The framework uses hashing techniques to ensure data integrity and employs proof of stake mechanisms for enhanced security. Blockchain’s decentralized data storage and cryptographic hashing for each block make it effective in safeguarding data integrity. The paper demonstrates the use of blockchain for developing online exams, storing each question and answer directly on the blockchain. To achieve this, we have created a module that integrates with the Moodle learning management system. Through a comparative analysis with Moodle’s default centralized storage, our module modifies the exam result storage, ensuring secure and tamper-proof data storage on the blockchain. By leveraging the blockchain, exam data is reliably secured, maintaining integrity, and resisting manipulation. Our results show that data stored on the blockchain is entirely accurate, with no discrepancies compared to Moodle’s standard approach. The blockchain network provides a reliable and immutable platform, preventing unauthorized changes to student data. In conclusion, our blockchain-based framework offers a robust solution for enhancing the security and reliability of online exam results. By harnessing blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-proof nature, we ensure data integrity and transparency, providing a more trustworthy assessment of academic performance.","Information Systems Department, Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt; Business Information Systems Program, Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt; Faculty of Computers and Information Technology, Future University in Egypt, New Cairo, Egypt",M.

Using Card Sorting to Redesign the Information Architecture of a University e-Learning Platform,"Today, most higher education institutions use e-learning platforms. Information Architecture (IA), the way that content is organized and interconnected, in such e-learning environments often poses usability problems to learners. This paper presents a case study of designing the IA for the Moodle website of mathematics courses at the University of the South Pacific. The study employed the open card sorting method and involved current staff, postgraduate students, and third-year face-to-face students. A total of 112 participants were involved and 50 cards representing items from the Moodle site were used. Individual sessions along with researchers were arranged, and the participants sorted the cards into groups that were meaningful to them. Each participant provided a label for every category of cards they created. This paper also proposes a new clustering algorithm, the Actual Agreement K-means (AAK-means), for analysis of open card sort data of more than 30 participants. The algorithm combines the Actual Agreement Method (AAM) and K-means. The results were compared to the results of a previous study that used the state of the art method. It was found that the proposed clustering algorithm provides increased insights when analyzing open card sorting datasets compared to existing methods. From the findings, a new Moodle Site IA is proposed.","School of Information Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Physics, The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece; School of Information Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Physics, The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji; School of Information Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Physics, The University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji",S.

A YOLO-Based Intelligent Detection Algorithm for Risk Assess-Ment of Construction Sites,"Construction safety accidents have become increasingly frequent in recent years, leading to numerous casualties and substantial property losses. These in-cidents are often attributed to inadequate supervision on construction sites and workers' low safety awareness. Traditional manual management methods, which are labor-intensive and resource-consuming, are no longer effective. Therefore, this study proposes a novel single-stage model based on YOLOv8s, designed for two primary purposes: detecting workers' personal protective equipment and monitoring and recognizing when workers enter hazardous ar-eas. The model provides real-time feedback on detection results to reduce the incidence of construction accidents. Additionally, a brief design for distance calculation was introduced. The model was trained for 200 iterations on a Roboflow dataset comprising 103,500 annotated images. Experimental results showed that YOLOv8s outperformed YOLOv8n, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5n in de-tection performance, achieving a mean average precision with the intersection over union (IoU) threshold set to 50% (mAP50) of 84.0%, precision of 85.0%, and recall of 60.5% across 9 detection classes. By leveraging artificial intelligence technology, this study aims to offer an effective method for enhancing construction site safety, which can be further improved with additional images and a more robust network architecture.","School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China",R.

A Framework for Predicting the Students at Risk Using AI: A Case Study,"This paper proposes a framework for predicting students who are at the risk of poor academic performance and supports slow learners in higher education institutions (HEIs). Despite numerous studies identifying various circumstances that can lead to a student being at risk, disengagement and slow learning are the major factors that contribute to this issue. Most HEIs aim to provide support to these students after they fall into the students-at-risk (SAR) category which ends as a reactive approach. However, this paper aims to take a proactive approach by developing a framework that can monitor student learning and predict their performance well before they fall into the SAR category. To develop this framework, the authors conducted a case study among the undergraduate students offered in a HEI at Oman. These degrees are awarded by the UK University which is classified as level 6 by the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree (FHEQ), Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), UK. The module for this study is selected based on the learning experiences of students registered in the undergraduate courses over the last three years, higher number of registrations and higher number of at-risk students. The proposed framework can be embedded into the existing learning management system (LMS) to predict the future progression of students based on their weekly performance in the classroom and periodic completion of in-class activities. This model also promotes active participation in the learning process as an additional benefit.","Faculty of Information Technology, Majan University College, Muscat, Oman; Faculty of Information Technology, Majan University College, Muscat, Oman; Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, United States of America",R.

Comparative Analysis of Student Assessment during the COVID-19 Crisis,"During the coronavirus pandemic (summer of 2019/20) classes at the University were held via videoconferencing tool. The lectures were also available to the students in the form of recordings. For a written online colloquium we designed a specific system. The colloquium was solved while teacher simultaneously held a video conference call for guiding students on time limit of each question. The entire colloquium is divided into smaller tests; first test-the closed-type questions were mixed so that the student received his combination of questions. The open-ended questions were divided into separate tests and the students, via video conference call, received instructions when each question was opened. In this way, all students wrote the same questions at the same time, and a certain amount of time was set for each question. The next generation of students (2020/21) was again the pandemic generation. These students, like the previous generation, also got access to recorded lectures, so they could consult the lectures countless times. This generation wrote colloquia on paper in the classroom. This paper compares the results of these two generations of students in written colloquiums and final success in taking courses that include all the elements that are evaluated during the semester.","Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",A.

The System Admin's Perspective: A Discussion on AI in Education with LMS Admins,"Many higher education institutions (HEIs) are implementing or reviewing the implementation of predictive Learning Analytics to improve learning processes, identify students at risk or provide personalized learning paths. The responsibility for selecting, reviewing, implementing and supporting those systems falls on system administrators, an under-researched stakeholder group of Artificial Intelligence i n highereducation. I n this paper, we summarize qualitative insights from a workshop with system administrators in German HEIs. We find that the system administrators are highly aware not only of system requirements but also of the needs of various shareholder groups such as institutional leadership, learners and educators and that they put high emphasis on ethical, transparent and compliant system use. We conclude that system administrators should be involved more in research on the use of technology in education and that AI systems used in education need to provide possibilities to sufficiently test the system, including anonymous y et realistic test scenarios and data.","School of Computing, Communication and Business, HTW Berlin University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, Germany; School of Computing, Communication and Business, HTW Berlin University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, Germany; School of Computing, Communication and Business, HTW Berlin University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, Germany",K.

Examining Students’ Online Learning and Collaboration Using Analytics-Supported Assessment Tools and Dashboards,"This paper reports on the preliminary findings of designing a learning analytical tool to assess and facilitate online collaborative learning in discussion forums. The analytics tool developed is grounded on collaboration theories to unravel students’ online collaboration, encompassing three features: (a) participation and build-on posts, (b) lexical keywords for domain understanding, and (c) communicative acts for dialogic interactions. The tool was designed to analyze students’ online discussions for two classes in a postgraduate educational studies course. Findings unravel student online collaboration behaviour, including (a) high engagement with online posts exceeding course requirements, (b) frequency/ links among keywords used (not used) indicate students’ knowledge networks and gaps, and (3) dialogic communication acts commonly employed while higher-level acts (e.g., coordination) not yet adopted. Findings also indicate student groups using a higher frequency of communication acts (more dialogic in discussion) also obtained higher grades, providing some validation. Implications suggest how the tools can be used to assess social-semantic-dialogic online collaborative behaviour and how instructors can use analytics information to adapt their instructional strategies to address students’ knowledge gaps and provide feedback. Students can also use the analytics information to regulate and improve online discussions.","Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong S.A.R, P.R.

T-VLC: A Trust Model for Virtual Learning Communities,"In the context of virtual learning communities (VLCs), where the participants may not know each other, it is necessary to have a mechanism to help when deciding who to work with and what reliable contents and information sources are. This study aims to design a generic trust model, named T-VLC, applicable to VLCs, which can be adapted to different learning scenarios. T-VLC is composed of eight factors—direct experience, reputation, role, knowledge, security, quality, institutional trust, and closeness, which, with their corresponding weights, will estimate the trust among the members of the community. T-VLC is a generic model that can be adapted to a particular educational context by adjusting the weights associated with each factor. In addition, this article presents the implementation of the model in the modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle) learning environment systems and describes the experimentation and results obtained in four real educational contexts.","Universidad Nacional de Loja, Loja, Ecuador; Computer Languages and Systems Department, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, San Sebastian, Spain; Computer Languages and Systems Department, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, San Sebastian, Spain",L.

Integration of Machine Learning Algorithms for E-Learning System Course Recommendation Based on Data Science,"A big database is mined for hidden predictive information in a process known as data mining. This information can then be used for a variety of commercial purposes, including bioinformatics and e-commerce. There are three different data mining algorithms: association rules, classification, and clustering. The behaviour of students who are interested in a specific collection of courses can be recognized with the help of the course recommender system. For a particular collection of information, we get information on course enrolment. We use learning management systems like Moodle for gathering this data. Following data collection, several combinations of data mining algorithms are used, such as classification and association rule algorithms, clustering and association rule algorithms, mining in classified and clustered data, integrating clustering and classification algorithms in association rule algorithms, or just the cluster analysis algorithm. As various machine learning algorithms, we employ ADTree classification, Simple K-means, and Apriori Association Rules in this research. So, in order to determine the optimum algorithmic combination for proposing courses to students using online learning, we provide five distinct ways. We compare the outcomes of this combined strategy with those of using simply the association rule algorithm, and we propose the optimum algorithmic combination for recommending courses in online learning based on our simulation.","Management/Commerce/International Business, DR G R D College of Science, India; Department of Computer Science, Shivaji University, Kolhapur, Maharashtra; Uttaranchal Institute of Technology, Uttaranchal University; Department of AERO, Parul University; Department of Marketing, Sri Balaji University, Pune (SBUP); Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chennai Institute of Technology",K.

Clustering students’ online behavior and relation with academic performance,"In recent years, online courses have become very popular due to the restrictions on the movement of people resulting from the COVID pandemics. The expansion of online learning platforms has renewed interest in developing techniques for delving into student behavior and improving their learning experience. This paper proposes a novel analysis of data obtained from Moodle’s Activity Log using Learning Analytics techniques and different clustering algorithms. The main goal is to understand the students’ task-related behavior, to generate a comprehensible model, and to comprehend how it is related to their academic performance. The students were grouped using a single feature calculated for each task the students must complete in the course. The results show that this single feature is enough to model the students’ behavior and their academic performance. Different clustering algorithms and number of clusters were used, and K-Means algorithm with three clusters achieved the best result. These three groups are comprehensible and explain the students’ behavior according to their activity in the task’s submission. The clusters also have a direct relation to the students’ final grade in the course, being one of them composed of students at risk of failure.","Language and Computer Science, University of Málaga, Málaga, Spain; Language and Computer Science, University of Málaga, Málaga, Spain; Language and Computer Science, University of Málaga, Málaga, Spain",A.

Applying the DevOps methodology for a more efficient process of teaching-learning computer programming,"Teaching and Learning programming languages in higher education, especially for the first-year students, is a major challenge due to two main factors: the ratio of students/teachers in these courses is usually very high, not allowing for a greater proximity between teachers and students; and these students have distinct backgrounds and logical reasoning, and therefore make progress at very different paces. Several studies show that the retention rates for such courses are high among the students in the introductory classes all across the globe. With the ever-increasing demand from the industry for professionals with programming skills, higher education institutions pressure the teachers for more positive results.The same demand for more efficiency and effectiveness is common in every sector of the industry, including software. DevOps is a software development methodology largely adopted by the software industry, that promotes the continuous improvement of the software development process. This methodology simplifies the problems across all development stages and promotes cooperation supported by the automation of tasks through tools and well-defined flows.This paper presents a method that explores the possibility to improve the process of teaching-learning computer programming, by recurring to the principles of DevOps to create an improved approach able to individualize learning and reduce the teacher’s effort. A Moodle-based platform was developed with several mechanisms that 1) automate tasks such as providing learning materials and exercises to each student, controlling the performance of the work, and providing feedback to student and teacher; 2) allow teachers to receive quick feedback and focus on what really matters, i.e., the difficulties of the students, the preparation of new learning resources for each student or group of students; and 3) let the students practice and study at their own pace. A pilot experience took place with one teacher and the students of an introductory course of Programming. Although preliminary and with the participation of a reduced number of students, the obtained results are promising.","Polytechnic of Coimbra, Coimbra Institute of Engineering Rua Pedro Nunes–Quinta da Nora, Coimbra, Portugal; Polytechnic of Coimbra, Coimbra Institute of Engineering Rua Pedro Nunes–Quinta da Nora, Coimbra, Portugal",A.

A SCRUM-based Methodology for Implementing an Interactive Virtual Learning Environment to Teach Cybersecurity to Children,"Implementing a cybersecurity course for children is complicated since topics such as sexting, cyberbullying and grooming are difficult to explain in schools and households. Although similar initiatives are available online, they lack of structure and engagement because their target audience are mainly English-speaking adults. Conversely, forced lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic may have increased children exposure to Internet threats due to the unsupervised usage of social networks. As a result, despite being more tech-savvy than adults, children are still naive, making them an easy target for attackers, urging families and schools to learn about Internet threats and effective ways to counter them. In this paper, we expand previous work, by delivering a virtual learning environment powered by Moodle to teach cybersecurity to Spanish-speaking children through interactive content. Our main contribution is introducing a 5-phase SCRUM-based methodology by combining UDL, ADDIE and DPIPE for an agile development, deployment and publication of learning content. To enhance the learning experience, during the content creation and publication, 3D anthropomorphic characters were designed to encourage learning through stories, videos and games, making it easier to talk about difficult topics related to dangerous online behaviour. The evaluation results show that the proposed VLE has an acceptable performance and delivers an enjoyable learning experience for children, parents and teachers.","Dept. de Inform. y Cs. de la Comp., Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador; Facultad de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador; 3D Modeling and Animation, SLF 3D Art & Creative Games, Coventry, United Kingdom; Facultad de Ingeniería de Sistemas, Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador; Dept. de Inform. y Cs. de la Comp., Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador; Dept. de Inform. y Cs. de la Comp., Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito, Ecuador",D.

PhishWise: Enhancing Students Understanding of Social Engineering Awareness in Phishing Through Gamification,"Phishing poses a significant threat in cybersecurity, often exploiting human vulnerabilities through social engineering. Raising awareness, particularly among students, is essential to mitigate this risk. This paper presents PhishWise, a gamification-based application designed to enhance students' understanding of phishing and social engineering techniques. The gamified learning model is integrated into learning management systems (LMS). The study employed statistical analyses to evaluate PhishWise's impact on students' awareness. Using an experimental method, students were divided into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group was taught using PhishWise, while the control group received conventional instruction. The research, conducted through an e-learning instructional model using Moodle, demonstrated significant improvements in comprehension. The Wilcoxon test results, with a p-value of less than 0.001, indicated a significant difference between pre-test and post-test scores in the gamification group, highlighting the intervention's effectiveness. Furthermore, the Mann-Whitney test confirmed a substantial increase in understanding, reinforcing PhishWise's impact.

Feasibility of interconnecting the University of Bangui and peripheral areas via the TVWS for e-learning in the context of COVID-19,"The campuses and classrooms of the University of Bangui do not have connectivity due to insufficient network infrastructure. However, there are Dynamic Spectrum Access technologies in the unused VHF and UHF analog TV band called TV White Space that can be used to provide high-speed Wi-Fi access over wide coverage and at lower cost. Since March 2020, courses have been suspended at the University of Bangui to effectively limit and combat the COVID-19 pandemic. After a three-month period of containment, academic activities have resumed. The increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 contamination raises concerns about this resumption. Given the rules of social distancing that limit the number of students in classrooms, the risks of travelling by public transport and the lack of motivation of some students following years of war, the University of Bangui can organize distance learning as a transitional measure.This paper is the subject of a feasibility study on the interconnection of surrounding neighborhoods and villages by TV White Space at the University of Bangui that can accommodate students and teachers for distance learning courses in the context of COVID-19.The methodological approach consists in studying the deployment of a White Space TV network to interconnect the peripheral areas at the University of Bangui, then using the Moodle distance learning platform on which we integrate the virtual classroom plugin, deployed locally and running without Internet connectivity. The bandwidth of the White Space TV will be important to practice the educational activities without spending money to pay the Internet credits of the operators’ networks. Students can connect locally via Wi-Fi in the areas covered by the platform and follow the different academic activities according to their geographical location, while others closer to the university can go to the classroom to attend classes with the professor in the rules enacted for protection against COVID-19.Our solution initially helps to break the digital divide and then to promote e-learning at the University of Bangui in the context of COVID-19.","Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal",E.

The Relationship Between Students’ Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Their Behavior within Educational Systems,"Leveraging user behavior has become an increasingly valuable resource for modeling and personalizing systems based on the unique characteristics of each user. While recent studies have recently been conducted along these lines, there is still a lack of understanding of the relationship between students’ Myers-Briggs Type Indicators and their behavior within educational systems. Facing this problem, we conducted a long-term study (15 weeks) with 96 students, analyzing how their engagement metrics and communication frequency in a Moodle Learning Management System are related to their Myers-Briggs personality types (i.e., extroversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving). The primary findings indicate that i) participants identified as extroverted demonstrated heightened activity levels throughout more weeks of the course, and ii) participants characterized by judging and thinking traits engaged in a greater number of activities over the course duration. The results contribute to the field of educational technologies by providing valuable insights into the relationships between different characteristics associated with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and students’ behavior when using an educational system.","SDU University, Almaty, Kazakhstan; Tampere University, Tampere, Finland; University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom; Tampere University, Tampere, Finland",A.

Are You Still There? An Exploratory Case Study on Estimating Students’ LMS Online Time by Combining Log Files and Screen Recordings,"The time students spend in a learning management system (LMS) is an important measurement in learning analytics (LA). One of the most common data sources is log files from LMS, which do not directly reveal the online time, the duration of which needs to be estimated. As this measurement has a great impact on the results of statistical models in LA, its estimation is crucial. In the literature, there are many strategies for estimating the duration, which do not represent the actual online time of the students. In this article, we combine LMS log files of our students with parallel screen recordings and automatically analyze for how long the LMS is present in the video. We visualize the results and show that common online time estimation strategies do not represent the online time for our students accurately. By using modified online time estimation methods, we find estimations that fit the data of our students better on an individual basis.","Institute for Information Management Bremen, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany",P.

Rethinking Programming Education: A Lecture-Free Approach,"Just-in-time hands-on experience is essential for learning programming. It not only helps reinforce learned concepts immediately, but also encourages the exploration of new concepts and language constructs. Integrating hands-on activities into traditional programming classrooms, however, presents a fundamental challenge. Coordinating instructor explanations with student coding activities and providing timely feedback to all students before moving forward is impractical for large or medium-sized classes. This paper demonstrates how cognitive and constructive learning principles can help transform a classroom into an active learning environment that blends conceptual learning and hands-on experience for an object-oriented programming course. Instead of attending traditional lectures, our students use the class time to participate in Moodle-based activities that feature diverse question types and immediate feedback. They work at their own pace, individually or in small teams, while the instructor guides them and provides support as needed. In a section of 41 students, 88% preferred this approach over lectures. These students scored 14.2% higher on the same exam compared to 111 peers enrolled in other sections that used traditional teaching in the same semester.","Department of Computer and Information Engineering, Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",A.

Personality and creative thinking in artists and the idea of their reputation on Social media,"The purpose of this study was to test the existing relationship of the five personality factors called Big Five, such as agreeableness/cordiality, responsibility, openness to experience, extraversion and neuroticism. According to the validations carried out in the exploratory and confirmatory phases, the agreeableness/cordiality factor showed low levels of reliability and a lack of adequacy of its items with its factor, for which the decision was made to remove this latent variable from the structural model. The study was carried out with 112 people dedicated to the visual arts among students and professionals in Arequipa - Peru. The study was carried out in two phases, in the first one the reliability tests and factorial analysis of the instrument were carried out (exploratory phase), using the IBM-SPSS software. In the second phase, the confirmatory analysis was carried out, using the PLS-SEM methodology for this purpose, which is a multivariate method called, Modeling of Structural Equations with Partial Least Squares. The study would reveal that four of the five personality factors (except agreeableness/cordiality), would influence the latent variable creative thinking more than the idea of their reputation on social media in the artist’s part of this research.","National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru; National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru; National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru; National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru; National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru; National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru; National University of San Agustin, Arequipa, Peru",O.

Modern Technology Usage For Education Field During COVID-19: Statistical Analysis,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had vast effects on the concept of education as a whole. During the pandemic, students had no access to physical teaching practices, which had been adapted worldwide as the principal way of education since the 1800's. Due to the restrictions imposed to garner safety from the spread of the virus, this methodology had to be modified based on the situation at hand. Alternatives through the usage of Virtual Learning Platforms (VLP), Online Tutoring Platforms (OTP), Web Conferencing Platforms (WCP) and multiple assessment tools like plagiarism checker, poll sites, quiz platforms, online proctored examinations (OPE) started gaining popularity among all institutes to cope with the limitations levied. The technologies molded a path for student-teacher interaction, performance assessments, document sharing and online tutoring. This research highlights the lack of online tutoring equipment, educators' limited expertise with online learning, the knowledge gap, a inimical atmosphere for independent study, equity, and academic success in postsecondary learning. The goal of this review is to present an overview of available technologies for online teaching that can be used to improve the quality of education during COVID-19.","School of Engineering and Technology CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, India; School of Engineering and Technology CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, India; School of Engineering and Technology CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, India",N.

Integrated High-Workload Services for E-Learning,"E-learning platforms are valuable tools to support and enhance the learning and teaching process during online classes. Even though these platforms are already well-known and have been widely used for a long time, transitioning to fully online activities with a large number of users can lead to an exponential growth in resource usage. Moreover, the availability of these platforms becomes critical since the learning activities cannot be interrupted, and the vital information (assignments, grades, and shared resources) cannot be lost. Thus, the system administrators must implement a scalable solution to accommodate many users and activities. Determining the most suitable architecture is a non-trivial task that must consider the various tools, services, and interconnect options that are available. This paper presents our approach to setting up an integrated high-workload e-learning setup used for online classes in University Politehnica of Bucharest and can be used as a reference by other universities. The e-learning platform must accommodate around 35000 users and 11000 courses; thus, its management is not trivial. In this paper we present our approach to integrating all the services necessary for a responsive online platform and to automating e-learning management operations such as class creation and user course enrolments. Moreover, we present our testing methodology and the deployment of the proposed architecture, as well as the results we have obtained in production, especially during the time when all teaching activities were performed using online platforms.","Department of Computer Science, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Computer Science, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Computer Science, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; Department of Computer Science, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",D.

Assessing SQL Programming Language Learning Effectiveness with Peer Assessment Annotation Tool,"In recent years, programming skills such as programming and program traceability have become increasingly important due to the need to develop and maintain many Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet and Things (IoT) applications. As a result, many studies have used the traceability of program segments to assess the ability of learners to write, test, and debug programs. Several assessment methods have required testing questions such as selection or filler. However, it is still challenging to identify the root cause of these errors by assessing these questions.Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language used for relational database management and data manipulation; though particularly useful for querying, adding, modifying, and deleting records in databases, it is a fundamental skill and an essential course for students in the information field to learn how to use databases. Therefore, this study proposes using an annotation tool for peer assessment of SQL language learning and analyzing the correlation between this method and learning outcomes to verify that the method helps assess students' SQL language writing and error detection abilities. The results of the study showed that the average score of students who used the annotation tool to learn SQL language was 17.38 points higher than that of students who did not use the annotation tool, thus proving that the annotation tool can improve learning outcomes.","Department of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of M-Commerce and Multimedia Applications, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan",S. -H.

Towards a Learning Analytics Model in Higher Education Applied to a LMS in Virtual Education Based on Motivation Indicators for Permanence,"In recent years, the impact of Learning Analytics applied to higher education through HEIs has been identified in order to understand the academic performance of students, based on the interaction that students have in an LMS, using descriptive analytics, for example. However, there are few works that have focused on the integration of information from various sources, in addition to considering motivation as a fundamental part of student permanence in an academic course implemented in an LMS. This paper presents a proposed model of learning analytics in higher education applied to an LMS in virtual education based on motivation indicators for permanence. A review is presented of the way in which motivation has been measured in previous works and the model for carrying out said measurement in the future is proposed, by extracting the data generated through the use of an LMS. An analysis of the traditional measurement of motivation is presented, where two specific instruments are implemented such as AMS (Academic Motivation Scale) and IMI (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory), suggested by the reviewed literature, in addition to identifying the indicators that will be considered in the measurement proposal. The data of the Instituto Tecnológlco Superior de Perote is taken as a case study. It is a first version of the proposal and work is still being done on its development and implementation.

AMAN: Token-based Authentication to Improved Single Sign-On Security Between Systems,"The problems caused during the Covid-19 pandemic included disrupting the learning process, which was usually done face-to-face, and had switch to online. Many applications provide online learning features, requiring users to create multiple accounts for each application used. Therefore, the proposed solution is build a distributed system to combine various applications into one system. This research proposes AMAN (Authentication Model as Node) with the application of the concept of Single Sign On (SSO) and JSON Web Token (JWT) in Islamic Boarding School Academic Systems and Moodle E-Learning. Single Sign On is a log-in authentication system allowing users to access multiple resources with only one authentication, while Moodle is a popular platform for online learning media. By supplying a JSON Web Token (JWT), the server can provide the client permission to access protected data stored on the server via the OAuth2 protocol. The test method are SSO testing between academic systems and e-learning Moodle, token validation, JWT structure verification, and Network Sniffing Attack. The test results in this study show that the implementation of Single Sign On (SSO) using the OAuth2 protocol can form a secure system and interact with multiple platforms.","Department of Informatics, Siliwangi University, Tasikmalaya, Indonesia; Department of Informatics, Siliwangi University, Tasikmalaya, Indonesia; Department of Informatics, Siliwangi University, Tasikmalaya, Indonesia; Department of Information System, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia",E.

Cross-course Process Mining of Student Clickstream Data - Aggregation and Group Comparison,"This paper introduces novel methods for preparing and analyzing student interaction data extracted from course management systems like Moodle to facilitate process mining, like the creation of graphs that show the process flow. Such graphs can get very complex as Moodle courses can contain hundreds of different activities, which makes it difficult to compare the paths of different student cohorts. Moreover, existing research often confines its focus to individual courses, overlooking potential patterns that may transcend course boundaries. Our research addresses these challenges by implementing an automated dataflow that directly queries data from the Moodle database via SQL, offering the flexibility of filtering on individual courses if needed. In addition to analyzing individual Moodle activities, we explore patterns at an aggregated course section level. Furthermore, we present a method for standardizing section labels across courses, facilitating cross-course analysis to uncover broader usage patterns. Our findings reveal, among other insights, that higherperforming students demonstrate a propensity to engage more frequently with available activities and exhibit more dynamic movement between objects. While these patterns are discernible when analyzing individual course activity-events, they become more pronounced when aggregated to the section level and analyzed across multiple courses.","Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Vienna, Austria; Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Vienna, Austria",T.

School of Digital Wizards: Exploring the Gamification User Types in a Blended IT Course,"In this Research to Practice Work-in-Progress paper, we explore gamification user types and related motivation factors through a gamified learning platform used in an Information Technology (IT) course. With the advent and increasing usage of self-hosted online learning platforms like Moodle, universities need innovative ways to engage students to make learning tasks interesting, personally relevant and, hence, motivating. Gamification or ""use of game elements"" in education is one such innovation that has been found to support motivation and completion of tasks in a timely manner. However, research reveals the increasing need to differentiate game experiences by personalizing game designs for different player typologies or ""user types"" based on different motivational orientations. This study is based on experiences of students in an IT course in education, where the learning platform in Moodle was modified by implementing certain game elements such as narratives, avatar development and thematic badges. Data were collected through online questionnaires filled by student teachers, which aimed at identifying their predominant gamification user-types using an instrument based on the Hexad Player Type framework for gamification design. Based on the information gathered from these questionnaires, the course material was designed to better fit the characteristics of the major user types, and relevant recommendations were provided to the students for approaching the course material. The results show the predominant gamification user types in this group of students to be Philanthropist (motivated by purpose) and Socializer (motivated by relatedness). Similarities and differences of the predominant user types in this group are discussed in relation to different participant groups from similar studies carried out in different contexts. The study calls for further investigation of purpose and relatability as motivation factors when designing IT-related courses for students in education. Collectively, these results could be used to inform the design of online and blended learning platforms to improve the interest, engagement and motivation of learners.","Faculty of Education and Psychology, University of Jyväskylä, yväskylä, Finland; Department of Teacher Education, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; Department of Teacher Education, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; Department of Teacher Education, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; EURECAT, Barcelona, Spain; EURECAT, Barcelona, Spain; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain",A.

Towards Improving the Accessibility and Usability of a Mobile-based Learning Management System for Blind Primary School Teachers,"Learning management systems (LMS) have been widely adopted to deliver learning materials for blended and online courses. Nonetheless, most of these systems suffer from accessibility and usability flaws that prevent visually impaired users from using them effectively. Despite existing studies evaluating the accessibility and usability of LMSs, very few of them have been done with actual visually impaired users. This study assessed the accessibility and usability of the Moodle LMS with 15 visually impaired teachers from 3 schools in 3 regions in Tanzania. The study used the Axe Dev automated tool and Concurrent Think Aloud Protocol usability testing in two phases. Results show that despite efforts of LMSs such as Moodle to follow accessibility and usability guidelines, the system still has problems such as insufficient colour contrast, links with indiscernible text, meaningless alternative texts, and invisible gaps in the content.

Evaluation of a Gamified Elearning Course for Agile Methods,"For teaching agile methods in an IT undergraduate course we built up a gamified blended learning course. We created the course with gamification elements like videos, quizzes, badges, and points within the learning management system Moodle. To do so we used a gamification concept based on MDA (Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics). The goal of the gamification concept was to increase intrinsic motivation of the students. We evaluated the motivation of our students with a questionnaire that is based on the psychological motivation theory STD (Self Determination Theory). The paper will shortly show how we built up the course in Moodle, and also gives some details on the used plugins and gamification elements. The main focus is on the evaluation which was done using a standardized questionnaire on intrinsic motivation built upon SDT at the beginning and at the end of our course. 39 students participated before taking the course and 16 after the completion of the course. The evaluation shows that some elements in the course like Videos and quizzes increase the motivation clearly whereas others do not. We could show an increase of intrinsic motivation in some factors of the questionnaire we used, but not in all factors.","Faculty of Computer Science and Business Information Systems, THWS Würzburg-Schweinfurt, Würzburg, Germany; Unternehmensberatung H&D GmbH, Munich, Germany",I.

Collaborative learning through PBL and virtual monitoring,"E-learning has increased in recent years and has become an essential element in education. In this paper, we show how we have carried out a collaborative learning implementing a project-based learning and how analyzing information that the Moodle platform stores but does not display in a teacher-friendly way can be useful for professors to track learning evolution of the students effectively and efficiently. Twenty topics have been defined on which students could work in groups of 3-5 people and create a tutorial that would be made available to the rest of their peers. We have developed a Python script that processes a set of metrics such as concurrent connections, relationship between connections and students as well as between members of the groups and periods of connections. From this kind of interactions, we have related the degree of participation of each student, how each group has been involved, when the students of the same group have met in Moodle at the same time, and the grades obtained. In the PBL, 56 students have participated and at the end of the process we have obtained feedback from 38 students through a Likert-type survey. The results of the virtual monitoring show that peer-to-peer learning and continuous interaction among the members of the PBL groups reduce the isolation of the students in virtual environments and favor the successful completion of the course.","Department of Computer Science, University of Cádiz, Cádiz, Spain; Department of Computer Science, University of Cádiz, Cádiz, Spain; Department of Computer Science, University of Cádiz, Cádiz, Spain",S.

Predicting at-risk students with LMS data: a comparison between Adaboost and LSTM algorithms,"The prediction of students at-risk (dropout and failure) is a largely explored problem on Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The present work compares the results of two different algorithms used to generate predictive models to early detect students at-risk, LSTM and Adaboost. This comparison aims to improve the performances of the models already implemented and integrated on a Moodle dashboard. For the comparison, data from a total of 122 students was collected from Moodle over four semester of an Introductory Programming course offered at Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Models were generated for each one of the 17 weeks of the semester, and their AUROC measures were then calculated and compared to evaluate the differences between LSTM and Adaboost. The results have shown that even though LSTM models presented a better performance than Adaboost, these differences were not statistically significant.","Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Araranguá, SC, Brasil; Universidad de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopólis, SC, Brasil; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Araranguá, SC, Brasil",R.

"Preparedness of Blended Education prior to SARS-COV-2 Pandemic via Google Classroom for the fifth Year Medical Students, Otolaryngology Rotation","Background: Generally, we use face-to-face manner as a main method for teaching while some flipped classroom applied online to get more achievement. The Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine(PCM) has introduced the online Google Classroom (GC) to the fifth-year medical students, in the academic year of 2019. The main purpose of the online GC may be applied to the flipped classroom for the fifth-year medical students. Due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic situation at the time of this academic year, each rotation should get a different learning method. Therefore, it appeared that the second to the seventh rotation from total 8 rotations learned by blended education. Face to face manner of teaching was applied first then it was switched to online GC. After that, the eighth rotation came at the same time of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, they were switched to the online GC only. It may be very hard if the online teaching has not been prepared before the time comes. The purpose of this study was to report the result of the application of GC and difference between group of the second to seventh rotation and the group of eighth rotations. How, the first rotation was not included in the study since they had opportunity to learn only face to face procedure. Methods: This is a descriptive prospective study by data collection from 86 medical students of the second to eighth rotations while the eighth rotation studied 100% online. The variable data, including a general information, satisfaction, and tools for accessing the GC were obtained from the questionnaires given to the second to the eighth rotation of the fifth-year medical students. Besides, the daily quiz (DQ) created and evaluated by the second-year residents were preformed and analyzed for the relationship with multiple choice question marks, slide quiz marks, objective structured clinical examination marks and practical marks. Moreover, the questionnaires regarding the comparison between the Google Classroom and the Moodle (MD) were also given to the sixth to eight rotations. Results: From evaluation (of the full mark of 5) of satisfaction and usage, it was found that the satisfaction was 4.7, difficulty to access was 3.2, suitability of DQ was 4.5 as well as the content of pedagogy, bedside teaching and OPD teaching conform with DQ was 4.5. Information through GC was useful by 4.2. Convenience to do SDL through GC was 4.5. Preferring to do SDL through GC was 4.5 and believe that GC could reduce paper consumption was 4.8. Comparison between GC and MD, there were 66.7% (26/39) of students who answered the evaluation with 96.1% preferred GC. Among these, 80.8% thought GC was easier to access, and 76.9% thought GC was more user friendly than MD. Correlation analysis by Pearson correlation, it was found that rotation was related to slide quiz (p = 0.010) and PBL marks (p < 0.001). Those who had more numbers of answering quizzes would gain higher quiz marks (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Using of the blended education to familiarize students, faculty and support staffs with learning management system are important since if 100% online teaching is needed. The change from face to face to online could be easily performed. Almost of student preferred Google Classroom to Moodle.","Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand",A.

To Do or not to Do Previous Homework in Computer Education,"The first contact of freshmen students with computer thinking and programming languages is not an easy task. There are several strategies that can be used before, during and after face-to-face classes. Flipped classes are a way to save time in activities that can be better done in the form of previous work - guided by the teacher. And the time gained in person can be used in tasks that are much more productive than traditional lectures. This study is based on an introductory programming semester of post lockdown COVID-19, initially with 101 students, with the strategy of providing study materials for students to work on before class (as in flipped classes). We use attendance in classes, access-work MOODLE, the two grades obtained during the semester, as well as some information about the student (age, course, gender, previous knowledge of programming languages), and the level that the students think it was their presence in classes and on MOODLE in the middle and at the end of the semester to measure the success of the experiment. It seems that this type of strategy can be excellent for students who attend classes weekly and do their homework, but it can be a cause of dropout if taken to the extreme.","REMIT, Universidade Portucalense, Porto, Portugal",S.

LMS Logs and Student Performance: The Influence of Retaking a Course,"In learning analytics applications, some of the most important data sources often include the activity of students in online platforms such as learning management systems. While the utility of logs extracted from these kinds of systems is undeniable, it is important to be aware that there may be contextual factors that can change how these data is interpreted. The study showcased in this paper analyzes the direct influence between the activity volume of students in a course, as given by Moodle LMS logs, and academic performance, in the form of the final grade obtained. Moreover, we perform separate observations of this influence depending on whether the student is enrolled in the course for the first time, or if they are retaking it after failing to pass in previous academic years. The results show that a correlation exists between raw volume of interactions with the LMS and final grade, but only for first-time students. This correlation is nonexistent when considering retaking students.","atlanTTic Research Center, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain; atlanTTic Research Center, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain; atlanTTic Research Center, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain; atlanTTic Research Center, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain",M.

Assessment of Learner Emotions in Online Learning via Educational Process Mining,"This Research Work in Progress paper presents a novel work on affective learning. At various stages in the learning process, emotions can have an impact on the learner. Positive emotions could act as a catalyst during learning while negative emotions could act as a resistor. As educators, it is crucial to consider learners’ emotions during their learning process. Educators need to design their teaching methods/ practices adapting to learner emotions. For this, emotions need to be assessed. Assessment can be done during physical classes where educators assess through their tacit knowledge. However, it is quite impossible for educators during online classes. This research focuses on assessing learner emotions during online learning by analyzing learner behavioral patterns using behavior theories. Data for the analysis is obtained from event data in Moodle Learning Management System. Finally, I expect to develop a software solution beneficial for educators to design their teaching methods/ practices considering their learners’ emotions.","Department of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka",D.

Competition as an Effective Motivational Tool in Online Education,"We would like to present a pilot function of the e-Iearning framework of the University of Dunaujvaros with its renewed functionality and the benefits that can be associated with it. The sharing of online educational content and online pedagogy is becoming more and more prevalent and accepted in higher education. In order to meet the expectations of students and teachers, we are trying to use the Moodle framework as a platform for communication, knowledge acquisition and assessment. Student activity, the use of functions set up with different parameters, is administered, and statements and evaluations are made. The evaluation system will be made more enjoyable for the students by using the ranking and highlighting systems familiar in gaming software. We assess the effectiveness of the student-centeredness of the designed service, its possibilities and its motivational impact on the students, by evaluating the competitive feelings that are learned in the game basics. In this study, we discuss the results obtained after the introduction of the new system and the conclusions that can be drawn from them. Of note is the change in the amount of measurable activity in the framework and the distribution of the types of content clickable. In the concluding part of the paper, we will focus on further development directions, as well as on connected services and directions for further development, and try to make suggestions. The further development described in the paper is basically a successful implementation of the competitive motivation measurement, but further fine-tuning and linked services are needed.","Dunaújvárosi Egyetem Dunaújváros, Magyarország; Dunaújvárosi Egyetem Dunaújváros, Magyarország; Dunaújvárosi Egyetem Dunaújváros, Magyarország; Dunaújvárosi Egyetem Dunaújváros, Magyarország",H.

E-learning Challenges for Lecturers in Indonesia Higher Education Institutions,"Since the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, e-learning has become a necessity. There may have been some uncertainty on how to perform e-learning properly because many educational institutions may not have expected the rapid change in learning style. This is especially true when it comes to offering an e-learning management system (LMS). This study aims to examine the affordances of higher education institutions in Indonesia in conducting the e-learning during the pandemic. To understand more about the adoption of e-learning in their individual institutions, we conducted an online survey towards 100 university lecturers from several cities. The results revealed that 79% of the participants used a specially built LMS in their universities, while the rest still used commercially built LMS like Moodle. Then, 82% of the participants prefer blended learning model which combined face-to-face and e-learning models, and 46% of them wanted to have a fifty-fifty division between face to face and e-learning. As for the challenges, no interaction with students was deemed as the most disturbing challenge for the lecturers. The results imply that e-learning will continue to be implemented in Indonesia, regardless of the condition of the pandemic. Thus, universities should provide an e-LMS that can cater all the e-learning needs, while lecturers should also equip themselves with pedagogical as well as technological skills to face the e-learning challenges.","English Department, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia; English Department, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia",C.

AttenFace: A Real Time Attendance System Using Face Recognition,"The current approach to marking attendance in colleges is tedious and time consuming. I propose AttenFace, a standalone system to analyze, track and grant attendance in real time using face recognition. Using snapshots of class from live camera feed, the system identifies students and marks them as present in a class based on their presence in multiple snapshots taken throughout the class duration. Face recognition for each class is performed independently and in parallel, ensuring that the system scales with number of concurrent classes. Further, the separation of the face recognition server from the back-end server for attendance calculation allows the face recognition module to be integrated with existing attendance tracking software like Moodle. The face recognition algorithm runs at 10 minute intervals on classroom snapshots, significantly reducing computation compared to direct processing of live camera feed. This method also provides students the flexibility to leave class for a short duration (such as for a phone call) without losing attendance for that class. Attendance is granted to a student if he remains in class for a number of snapshots above a certain threshold. The system is fully automatic and requires no professor intervention or any form of manual attendance or even camera set-up, since the back-end directly interfaces with in-class cameras. AttenFace is a first-of-its-kind one-stop solution for face-recognition-enabled attendance in educational institutions that prevents proxy, handling all aspects from students checking attendance to professors deciding their own attendance policy, to college administration enforcing default attendance rules.","International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",A.

Proposal of conversational chatbots for educational remediation in the context of covid-19,"This paper presents a conversational chatbots solution allowing, in the context of covid-19, to support, detect and reduce deficiencies and bring students to self-training in order to develop their skills. The chatbot intervenes during formative evaluations and identifies the student's misunderstandings and directs him/her at the end of the test towards the parts of the course dealing with the concepts that have not been mastered. In the context of covid-19, one of the barrier gestures being social distancing, face-to-face classes have been suspended. Many higher education institutions that were not prepared for e-learning suddenly switched to online courses in order not to lose the academic year. Students no longer have the follow-up that they had when they were learning face-to-face. The chatbot proposed in this work could help reduce the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the students' level. To allow learners to have a standardized learning environment, we have developed a plugin of the Moodle learning environment using the chatbot based on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) of Artificial Intelligence. In this work we show how our conversational chatbot is used for pedagogical remediation by indicating to the learner which chapters of the course to revise according to the gaps highlighted by the chatbot.","Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal",K.

Striving for platform independence in the e-learning landscape: a study on a flexible exercise creation system,"The contemporary e-learning landscape at universities consists of various tools, platforms and services. At the same time, an increasingly bigger proportion of learning happens online. When creating exams or exercises for students in such a setting, teachers often face the following issues: (1) having to create exercises for multiple platforms, (2) lack of support for creating complex exercises, and (3) having to transfer exercises between platforms. To solve these issues we created a platformin-dependent tool for creating e-learning exercises and exams. The system relies on the structured Markdown format, which is then parsed and exported to learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, or to PDF. Scripts can be used to fully customize and randomize the Markdown exercises for each student, which mitigates cheating through copying answers, and enables holding exams that students take asynchronously. Overall, we argue that as digital learning ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex, educational institutions and teachers should strive more strongly for platform independence. In this study, we demonstrate how this can be done with exams and exercises.","Dept. of Computing, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Dept. of Computing, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Dept. of Computing, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Dept. of Computing, University of Turku, Turku, Finland",S.

Enhanced Preprocessing Stage For Feature Extraction of Deepfake Detection Based on Deep Learning Methods,"Biometric identities are at risk of deepfake facial manipulation. Over the past few years, deepfake detection has been the subject of extensive research, most which centered on the application of machine learning strategies. However, the recognition of deepfake is still one of the most challenging problems in computer vision today. Deep learning has recently gained popularity due to its potential to solve a wide range of real-world problems, including detecting deepfakes. Our research focused on improving feature extraction methods by using deep learning and comparing preprocessing methods to show how they affect detection performance. A preprocessing approach was proposed to improve the regions of interest (ROIs) used to feed Moodle feature extraction. The proposed algorithmic approach involves finding one key frame extracted from a video by using the oriented fast and rotated brief algorithm, detecting the face oval region using the DLIB library as an ROI and performing quality improvement via contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)/adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and comparing them. On the FaceForensics ++ dataset, CLAHE demonstrated superior performance compared with AHE with InceptionV3 as a feature extractor.

Digital elementary school solution with moodlebox in a conflict zone: the case of the Central African Republic,"The political-military crisis of 2013 destroyed the Central African education system. Armed groups occupy 80% of the territory. They often use school buildings as base camps, playgrounds as shooting ranges and transform desks and chairs into firewood. Due to insecurity, most of the qualified teachers have abandoned their posts to stay in Bangui, the capital of the country. School-age children are left to their own devices without education. This constitutes a danger to peace, security and the socio-economic development of the country. Going to school, learning to read and write is a right that all children should enjoy.In this article, we propose a digital elementary school solution in conflict areas with moodlebox to enable these children to learn with the assistance of the teachers-parents.The methodological approach of our solution is based on the use of raspberry pi 3 b+ on which we deploy moodle for all elementary school classes. The solution does not need the Internet or network infrastructure to work. Each student is equipped with a tablet that allows him/her to connect to the digital elementary school platform via Wi-Fi. Teachers recruited and trained in these areas provide the necessary support for children to master the digital tools for their education, and the teaching model is based on active learning. Course content is prepared by qualified teachers and integrated on the platform. This solution contributes on the one hand to the mastery of Information and Communication Technologies for Education by primary school students in a constantly changing technological environment; on the other hand to the improvement of schooling, the consolidation of peace, security and socio-economic development, thus facilitating the emergence of good governance and democracy in Central Africa.","Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal; Laboratory LIRT, Higher Polytechnic School, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal",N.

Teaching Aerospace Software Quality at an Undergrad Level in the Pandemic – Experiences,"This paper describes the experiences of teaching software quality as an undergraduate course. The subject was offered at National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal and the course covered the aerospace standards, safety, software requirements, design, reviews, and testing. Teaching the ARP 4761, ARP 4754, DO 178C and DO 331 to the students was enlightening. The course was completely conducted online on Teams and Moodle and this itself brings out many insights of teaching an industry level training as an undergraduate course. The course covered the basic of these standards and went through a safety analysis process using the System Theoretic Process Analysis. The problem statement was an onboard scanner. This mimicked a radar system but was called a scanner and had a set of functionalities that was simple enough to understand at an undergrad level. A detailed set of requirements was developed during the course. The process of requirement review was done on the requirements to merge the workflow and process defined in the standards with a practical example. The design model and code were developed for the problem statement. This also went through a review process. A formal method approach was used to test the modes of the scanner. Finally, a set of random tests were developed with a set of Orthogonal Array tests to test the system. The use of a problem helped the students to better interact and understand the complexity.

A Case Study: Using STACK Questions in an Engineering Module,"Computer-assisted assessment (CAA) can give immediate feedback to students, which leads to better learning. This paper presents a case study of using STACK in a third-year mathematical engineering module. STACK is an advanced computer-assisted assessment tool that can automatically mark mathematical equations. STACK is a Moodle plugin that allows students to enter mathematical formulae as answers. It checks if the student's answer is mathematically equivalent to the model answer and can provide hints to the student. Students attempt the same question several times, getting hints with each incorrect attempt. STACK questions were used in three different settings: short practice problems that students did at home; long tutorial sessions that students did in class; a two-hour semester test. This paper reflects on the use of STACK during a semester. It summarises feedback from students that were collected during interviews, it discusses systemic challenges when implementing STACK questions, and it looks at the mark distribution of STACK-based questions. Overall, STACK proved to be a useful formative assessment tool. The immediate feedback allowed all the students to solve all the tutorial problems before the end of the tutorial session.

Intelligent Decision Support for Assistant Selection for Checking Works with Free Response in Massive Open Online Courses with the Use of Text Mining,"In massive open online courses (MOOCs), a teacher’s assistant role is very significant because the most important functions of tutors are delegated to assistants. Considering a huge number of students on every launch of the MOOC, the tutor is not able to serve it alone. The studies associated with the use of teacher’s assistants in online courses are focused on different aspects. However, the former do not address the question connected with the consideration of assistants’ ability to form response to performed works with free response (WWFRs) for the students properly, in detail and close to tutor’s feedback. The response obtained by the student will determine whether the required skills will be formed at him. This problem is particularly serious for engineering education with the presence of a large number of WWFRs: practical works, labs and other works. To cope with this issue, a method of intelligent decision support for assistant selection for checking WWFRs is suggested in the paper. The method contains the steps: the preliminary selection of assistants on eliminating criteria; organization of performance of assessment of works, earlier evaluated by the tutor, by assistants-candidates; definition of the quality of evaluation conducted by assistants-candidates by identifying the degree of similarity of their and tutor’s assessment results, employing text-mining. The proposed method was implemented in software using Moodle based learning management system and author’s application and tested on data on course “Information resource management” at university.","Department of Automated Management Systems, Ufa University of Science and Technology, Ufa, Russia",V.

An Analytic Study of Learning Management System in Higher Education,"This article describes the experience of supporting scholars using an e-learning platform. We use Moodle as an interactive existential tool to engage students and motivate them to complete individual assignments. Many universities worldwide are using e-learning platforms, but this is the first time they are using them, and it is a great learning/teaching experience. This paper should be easy to read and understand by showing the importance of using the university’s e-learning platform. It is demonstrated by the behavior of most commonly accessing the homework section and uploading assignments (sending homework) completed after an aggregate of 6.81 views of assignments. Another finding is the number of students who choose to alter the randomly generated passwords sent to them until they enroll in the course. Only 7.5 out of every 1,000 accounts had their passwords changed. Novelty This was done since most students use computers and save their passwords in their browsers, which allows them to log in immediately the following time they use them. There isn’t a single type of assignment suitable for all students. Students may be asked to do some activities independently in specific instances. It’s done after viewing a demonstration, and it’s also done to spark creativity. We do not receive help despite the pipeline. In some circumstances, pupils are expected to complete work alone.

Evaluating Pedagogical Incentives in Undergraduate Computing: A Mixed Methods Approach Using Learning Analytics,"In the context of higher education's evolving dynamics post-COVID-19, this paper assesses the impact of new pedagogical incentives implemented in a first-year undergraduate computing module at University College London. We employ a mixed methods approach, combining learning analytics with qualitative data, to evaluate the effectiveness of these incentives on increasing student engagement. A longitudinal overview of resource interactions is mapped through Bayesian network analysis of Moodle activity logs from 204 students. This analysis identifies early resource engagement as a predictive indicator of continued engagement while also suggesting that the new incentives disproportionately benefit highly engaged students. Focus group discussions complement this analysis, providing insights into student perceptions of the pedagogical changes and the module design. These qualitative findings underscore the challenge of sustaining engagement through the new incentives and highlight the importance of communication in blended learning environments. Our paper introduces an interpretable and actionable model for student engagement, which integrates objective, data-driven analysis with students' perspectives. This model provides educators with a tool to evaluate and improve instructional strategies. By demonstrating the effectiveness of our mixed methods approach in capturing the intricacies of student behaviour in digital learning environments, we underscore the model's potential to improve online pedagogical practices across diverse educational settings.","Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK; Department of Statistical Science, University College London, London, UK",L.

Investigation of the Accuracy of Machine Learning Methods in Prediction of Students Success,"One of the main factors affecting the future opportunities and career development of students is the results of the educational process. A high level of success in education makes it possible to obtain qualified specialists in the future and ensure economic growth. Prediction of success is an urgent task, because a quick response to possible problems allows to increase the student's chances of successfully passing the session, as well as to identify deficiencies that can be corrected. In the work, a study of the accuracy of predicting the success of students based on data on their attendance and grades was conducted. The following machine learning algorithms were studied: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Method, Random Forest. The parameters characterizing the accuracy of the classification are determined, namely: sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy. Based on the obtained results, receiver operating characteristic graphs were constructed to assess the ability of the classifier to correctly recognize positive classes and reject negative classes when the threshold value changes. In order to perform forecasting, data on user ratings and attendance for the first and second semesters of the 2021–2022 academic year were exported from the Moodle electronic learning management system database. The total number of student grade and attendance records exported to files was 1,308,262. The creation of predictive models was performed in the PyCharm development environment in Python using the Scikit-learn library. After performing the calculations, it is determined that the random forest method performs the best prediction of success based on the available input data and has a higher accuracy. The obtained accuracy value of 80% and AUC of 73% indicates the quality of the classification model and good discriminating power of the model. The graph of the receiver operating characteristic for the random forest method shows that it has a clearly defined area under the curve that is more curved up and to the left, which confirms the effectiveness of the model.

WIP: Use of a Self-Executing Notebook Based on Matlab's Live Editor for the Development of Autonomous Learning Competency in an Analog Communications Course,"This innovative practice WIP paper describes how autonomous learning competency is developed in a course called “Communications Theory 1” that covers analog communications topics within the Telecommunications Engineering Program. To this end, all course material has been redesigned as a self-executing notebook using Matlab Live Editor11https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.htm1 and is delivered chapter by chapter throughout the semester. This allows students to read the course content and interact with the simulations, modifying them freely to explore the session theory in greater depth and, finally, recognize relevant limits and characteristics. Within the course platform, based on Moodle, the contents have been accompanied by exercises in the Matlab Grader model, which allow feedback to the student when answering the questions provided, validating the developed code. This work helps to strengthen their knowledge in parallel to the activities carried out in the classroom. Since the self-executing notebook provides the information necessary to understand the behavior of the different analog communication techniques seen in the course, in the final chapter, all the knowledge is integrated into an activity that combines the flipped classroom and the puzzle technique, allowing students through teamwork, fully develop the final chapter of the course with a high level of autonomy. This work will be evaluated with the support of rubrics that will allow us to know its progression in the different learning outcomes related to the specific competencies developed in the course and the advancement of generic competencies, including autonomous learning. As a work in progress, initial measurements in applying the self-executing notebook indicate high student satisfaction with the notebook's content and the associated activities. Additional assessments are then planned to refine the teaching-learning cycle and improve course outcomes. Finally, new activities are proposed to complement the training by applying AI technologies and using new laboratory resources.","Engineering Department, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Lima, Perú; Engineering Department, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, Lima, Perú",A.

New didactic concepts (blended learning, “flipped classroom”) consist of alternating self-learning and face-to-face phases, with the former taking place in the LMS, i.e. online. However, no analysis has yet been carried out as to how students act with the material in the self-learning phase, or the teachers are not provided with any information about the learning progress of the students during the self-learning phase. In this paper, concepts of learning and teaching analytics are presented to answer these questions and to integrate the measures derived from them into the teaching processes in a sustainable manner.","Faculty Computer Science & Applied Mathematics, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien; Faculty Computer Science & Applied Mathematics, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien; Faculty Computer Science & Applied Mathematics, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien; Faculty Computer Science & Applied Mathematics, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien; Faculty Computer Science & Applied Mathematics, University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien",L.

Exploring the use of Wiris in the evaluation at an online course,"The change to the virtual study modality brought with it new opportunities for teaching and evaluation that were not contemplated in face-to-face learning. The assessment was one of the aspects that changed the most, and although learning platforms such as Moodle or Blackboard provide teachers with a variety of assessment tools, these are sometimes insufficient, particularly in statistics and mathematics courses. This is the reason why the teachers at Universidad Católica de Santa María were provided with the Wiris tool, which consists of a system that goes beyond the usual types of questions, adding functionalities for evaluation and feedback. Considering the background, this article seeks to describe the experience of the teachers with the implementation of Wiris, in addition to discussing some of its advantages and disadvantages, and commenting on the contribution it makes to the formative evaluation.","Dirección de Estudios Generales, Universidad Católica de Santa María, Arequipa, Perú; Facultad de Ciencias e Ingenierías Físicas y Formales, Universidad Católica de Santa María, Arequipa, Perú",E.

Analytical Evaluation and Experimental Study of the Developed Web-Application - Space Information Systems and Technologies - for Student Training and Control in English Language,"The relevance of the chosen topic lies in the fact that the development of an information system for teaching and controlling students in English in the training program “Informatics and Computer Science” can compete with other analogues. The developed web application corresponds to educational tasks and its content depends on the necessary needs of technical university students. This will help to improve the quality of the pedagogical process at the university, simplify and facilitate it both on the part of teachers and students, thereby reducing the teachers’ burden of the discipline “Foreign Language” and increasing the assimilation of this discipline by students based on their interest. Currently, more and more attention is paid to E-learning and distance technologies, which are actively used in the university both independently and mixed with a blended type of education. The systems of learning management are considered, their similarities and differences are presented. The examples are given describing the most popular LMS systems today. An analytical evaluation of the developed information system for teaching and controlling students in English in the training program “Informatics and Computer Science” was carried out, which was realized with respect to four existing distance learning systems, namely: MOODLE, Claroline, Atutor and OpenACS.

The challenge from remote to blended learning since the COVID-19 pandemic: the case of Operational Research in Industrial Engineering,"This work describes the didactic experience made in the period 2020-2021 in Operations Research course in Industrial Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of the National University of San Juan. Shifting to remote learning we made faster and deeper the methodological and technical changes in the teaching-learning process designed before pandemic. Both were based on the digital transformation of education and efforts to reform engineering education in Argentina: in order to meet the demands of this dynamic world, engineering programs are challenged to find innovative ways to teach classes so that graduates are prepared in soft skills as well as technical skills. The UNSJ Distance Education System made the Moodle platform immediately and massively available. This allowed us to make an abrupt transformation of the learning space. We use the flipped classroom method, design activities to promote transversal skills and modify the forms of evaluation. In response, the students have shown a strong commitment to the proposal, an important responsibility in group activities and a very good connection with virtual tools. In the post-pandemic we will opt a blend learning, to enhance the benefits of online and face-to-face teaching and tend to design a student-centered learning methodology.","Departamento de Ingeniería Electromecánica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina; Instituto de Energía Eléctrica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan CONICET, San Juan, Argentina; Departamento de Ingeniería Electromecánica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina; Departamento de Ingeniería Electromecánica, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina; Departamento de Filosofía y Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad Nacional de San Juan, San Juan, Argentina",N.

Enhancing the Early Student Dropout Prediction Model Through Clustering Analysis of Students’ Digital Traces,"Educational Data Mining and learning analytics have gained significant prominence in recent years, garnering attention from researchers worldwide. This is primarily due to their potential to improve decision-making processes within higher education. This study utilizes Educational Data Mining to suggest a clustering-based approach for classifying students based on their academic performance, specifically focusing on their interactions within Learning Management Systems in blended learning settings. Log data from the Learning Management System Moodle platform was analyzed to determine if valuable insights could be derived from student activities without the need for personal or invasive data. Given the large dataset, Principal Component Analysis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection were employed for dimensionality reduction. Three unsupervised learning models—BIRCH, DBSCAN, and GMM—were then applied to identify distinct student clusters. The results from the comparison revealed that the BIRCH algorithm was the most effective in accurately categorizing students based on their activities. Further analysis of identified clusters revealed a strong correlation between student engagement and academic outcomes, with two high-risk clusters demonstrating the highest dropout rates. To better understand the reasons behind the found clusters, the course duration was subsequently divided into intervals, and standard machine learning methods were applied to predict at-risk students over time, confirming that early identification of at-risk students using clustering is feasible. This study demonstrates the efficacy of non-invasive data collection and unsupervised learning models in predicting student success, emphasizing the importance of temporal and content-specific analysis. The proposed approach leverages clustering algorithms to enhance the understanding of student behavior by identifying patterns and grouping students with similar learning and engagement profiles. This supports the development of targeted interventions that are tailored to specific student needs, ultimately improving retention and success.","Department of Informatics, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Informatics, Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Nitra, Slovakia; Department of Informatics, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Informatics, Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Nitra, Slovakia",J.

Dazzle: Using Optimized Generative Adversarial Networks to Address Security Data Class Imbalance Issue,"Background: Machine learning techniques have been widely used and demonstrate promising performance in many software security tasks such as software vulnerability prediction. However, the class ratio within software vulnerability datasets is often highly imbalanced (since the percentage of observed vulnerability is usually very low). Goal: To help security practitioners address software security data class imbalanced issues and further help build better prediction models with resampled datasets. Method: We introduce an approach called Dazzle which is an optimized version of conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP). Dazzle explores the architecture hyperparameters of cWGAN-GP with a novel optimizer called Bayesian Optimization. We use Dazzle to generate minority class samples to resample the original imbalanced training dataset. Results: We evaluate Dazzle with three software security datasets, i.e., Moodle vulnerable files, Ambari bug reports, and JavaScript function code. We show that Dazzle is practical to use and demonstrates promising improvement over existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques such as SMOTE (e.g., with an average of about 60% improvement rate over SMOTE in recall among all datasets). Conclusion: Based on this study, we would suggest the use of optimized GANs as an alternative method for security vulnerability data class imbalanced issues.","North Carolina State University, USA; North Carolina State University, USA; North Carolina State University, USA; North Carolina State University, USA",R.

Centrality Metrics from Students' Discussion Fora at Distance Education,"In this study, we applied the HITS algorithm, an advanced network-based algorithm that produces the metrics “Authority” and “Hub” to indicate the importance of the nodes (tutors and students) in a discussion forum network. By using this algorithm, we evaluated the tutors' and the students' authority and hub scores, as a result of their participation in the fora at an Open University Moodle platform. Through a graph representation and the use of the HITS algorithm, we located those students with the highest authority and hub scores, in an attempt to find correlations between those metrics and the students' performance and role, in the learning process. Our study intends to offer useful knowledge, especially in distance learning settings, where there is a lack of physical interaction between tutors and learners. Additionally, as the plethora of the existing data does not allow tutors to identify early and before the mid and final evaluations, the active students, the HITS algorithm spots those students for them. Our aim is to empower the forum community role in Distance Education by giving it a more student-centered profile, as the most active student could cooperate with their tutors and be the leaders to support their peers' effort for a more self-directed learning.","School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Greece; School of Humanities, Hellenic Open University, Greece; School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Greece; School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Greece",E.

The use of artificial intelligence in learning management systems in the context of higher education : Systematic literature review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing, and its application is spreading at a good pace in recent years, so much so that AI has become part of everyday life in various sectors. According to several international reports, AI in Education is one of the emerging fields of technology in the education sector, from where much research is being developed to support educational processes. This paper aims to provide an overview of the research on AI applications in education management systems (LMS) in higher education through a systematic literature review following the protocol proposed by Kitchenham [1]. Three hundred six papers were initially identified from Scopus and EBSCOhost databases from 2010 to 2022, from which 33 papers were selected for final analysis according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The research results show that the LMS most used for implementing AI solutions in education is Moodle and that AI has been most used for student performance assessment based on student data.

How Fantasy May Affect Student Engagement in Gamified Fully Online Classes: A Mixed-Method Study,"Even though online learning has become the ‘new normal’ in many educational institutes around the world, its implementation is not always smooth sailing. Fully online learning often suffers from a lack of student engagement. It is therefore important for us to explore ways to alleviate student disengagement in online learning. In this study, we report the use of the goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration-fantasy (GAFCC-F) design model in online gamified classes. This mixed-method study examines the effects of exogenous and endogenous fantasies on student intrinsic motivation and course engagement. Study 1 was an exogenous fantasy embedded gamified online class where the plots and story have no association with the learning tasks on Moodle. Study 2 was an endogenous fantasy context where the plots could reflect the content of learning tasks. The results showed that the endogenous fantasy is more likely to improve student intrinsic motivation and course engagement than the exogenous fantasy context. Students immersed in the endogenous fantasy enjoyed doing the learning tasks more than the exogenous fantasy. Students’ perceptions of both types of fantasy were also explored.","Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR; Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR; Centre for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR",S.

Autorregulate: An Alternative to Support Self-Regulation in MOOCs,"Massive Online Courses (MOOCs) suffer from the high desertion of enrolled students due to different factors, including bad time management by the participants, lack of planning, lack of help-seeking, and poor self-monitoring of their actions in the learning process, which suggests that students do not self-regulate their learning. Diverse software tools have been created to support MOOC participants by favouring self-regulated learning (SRL). However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding how the different SRL model could be effectively, supported by ICT tools, what model inform in a better way the design of new tools to support SRL process in online setting, how the support of SRL affect the students’ performance in a MOOC environment or what is the best way to integrally evaluate the impact of the tools supporting SRL. In this article, we introduce the design and development process of the Autorregulate tool, a web application that supports self-regulation of learning in MOOCs. This tool is developed within the framework of broader research employing research-based design (RBD) to create methodological and technological tools to facilitate self-regulation in MOOCs. Autorregulate supports seven learning self-regulation strategies: goal-setting, strategic planning, time management, help-seeking, self-monitoring, self-recording (Take Note), and self-assessment, considering the SRL model proposed by Zimmerman. The tool was evaluated in a MOOC created on Moodle, with 224 participants, over three evaluation dimensions: 1) Students SRL to measure the effect of the Autorregulate tool on the self-regulation of the participants’ learning; 2) Autorregulate tool’s usability and usefulness; and 3) Participants’ interactions within SRL services. Results show participants’ high level of self-regulation of learning after the intervention (M=4,3; SD=0,85) according to the online self-regulated learning questionnaire (OSLQ). On the other hand, 92% of participants considered the Autorregulate tool usable, and 97% considered the tool useful. Finally, results show SRL services are widely used by participants, especially those supporting the strategies with better performances by participants, according to OSLQ results. The findings of this study contribute to broadening the discussion regarding the use of ITC to support SRL on MOOCs.","VirtuaLab Research Group, Instituto Tecnológico del Putumayo, Mocoa, Colombia; Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco, Cartagena, Colombia; VirtuaLab Research Group, Instituto Tecnológico del Putumayo, Mocoa, Colombia",J.

Exploring the Design and Implementation of a Robotic-Coding Camp in Teacher Education,"This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.","Centre for Teacher Education, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Centre for Teacher Education, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria",P.

Students’ Perception and Satisfaction on Technology-enhanced Active Student Engagement in Remote Teaching and Learning,"This paper presents technology-enhanced Active Student Engagement (ASE) techniques for online teaching and learning during the COVID-19 epidemic. ASE techniques include interactive teaching strategies, student interactions, active learning techniques, social presence, and customized teaching pedagogies. Such methods were practiced using e-Learning platforms, such as Moodle, and other tools, such as Google Meet, Jamboard, Google Chat, Discussion Group, Google Meet Breakout Room, Mentimeter, and electronic writing devices. A customized structure using the aforementioned ASE techniques and tools was practiced for daily online classes for three consecutive semesters during the pandemic. The course instructor conducted surveys to evaluate the student’s perception and the level of satisfaction about the ASE techniques, tools, and scaffolding used for the Electrical Circuit Analysis I course at the end of each semester. The survey reveals that the practiced ASE techniques, tools, and customized structure are efficient and effective in active student engagement during online teaching. It also indicates several challenges that the students have faced during the online sessions.","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman",R.

Beyond Question Shuffling: Randomization Techniques in Programming Assessment,"Randomization is a technique that can be used with programming assessments to discourage academic misconduct by making it unlikely for two colluding students to get the exact same questions. Previous research about randomization has shown it to be an effective tool for addressing academic misconduct, but this work often focuses on randomization broadly, with few considering specific techniques. In contrast, we consider different randomization techniques and the contexts that they are best suited to. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of randomization techniques against emerging AI technologies. This is done by exploring randomization in the context of an online quiz system that evaluates student responses to pro-gramming challenges, specifically the CodeRunner system for the Moodle learning management system. We provide a classification of techniques, and discuss the benefits of each. This classification starts with simpler techniques, such as shuffling question order, shuffling multi-choice question options, and question pooling. We then move on to more advanced techniques, including simple substitution, altering expected output, switching logic, and steganography. We also investigate two approaches to generating randomized questions, considering the benefits and drawbacks of each. These approaches are generating the questions beforehand (pre-generation) and generating the questions when the quiz is started (on-the-fly generation). We then identify four categories of assessment based on assessment that is formative/summative, and proctored/non-proctored, then identify which randomization techniques are suited for each category. Finally, we test randomized questions against OpenAI's Codex, to see if these techniques could prevent this new opportunity for academic dishonesty. We found that there are some types of questions that Codex currently performs poorly on, such as program reasoning, and creating complex classes, but overall randomization was not effective in defeating it, with Codex scoring 79.7% on questions that were created after it was trained, and 85.3 % on questions that could have been available to it when it was trained.","University of Canterbury, NZ; University of Canterbury, NZ; University of Canterbury, NZ",H.

Supporting Collaborative Writing Tasks in Large-Scale Distance Education,"In distance education courses with a large number of students and groups, the organization and facilitation of collaborative writing tasks are challenging. Teachers need support for planning, specification, execution, monitoring, and evaluation of collaborative writing tasks in their course. This requires a collaborative learning platform for coordinating all of the different phases in the writing process. In order to enable the design of such a platform, we created a process model of collaborative writing tasks that is based on the identification of participants, activities, phases, and orchestration from the literature. This model may serve as a basis for teachers to specify the instances for such tasks and can be used to determine the functional requirements needed for supporting model-compliant tasks on a collaborative learning platform. We present a general architecture for a platform of this kind that is independent of a concrete learning management systerm (LMS) system or shared editor and demonstrate its implementation using Moodle, Etherpad Lite, and Docker. The platform makes it easier for teachers to create groups and automatically assign members to collaborative workspaces. It enables asynchronous as well as synchronous text editing and communication. It also respects the European information security and data protection requirements and helps teachers monitor both the writing and reviewing activities. The platform was evaluated over a period of three semesters in distance learning courses with more than 4500 students. It proved a scalable and robust environment for coordinating the collaborative writing process of teachers and students and enables analysis of collaborative writing behavior by teachers and researchers.","Research Institute for Telecommunications and Cooperation e.V., Dortmund, Germany; Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, FernUniversität, Hagen, Germany",M.

Unveiling Uncertainty: Supporting Learners Through NLP-Driven Confusion Identification,"Online learning has increased significantly in popularity over the past several years, driven by global events such as the pandemic and the accessibility offered by educational platforms such as Moodle, Brightspace and so on. However, online learning platforms present challenges, including limited access to support and a sense of disconnection among students. This research works to mitigate these challenges by identifying confusion in learners in online learning platforms by analyzing their posts in course discussion forums. We utilized the Stanford MOOCPosts dataset, evaluated the performance of various ma-chine learning (ML) models, and explored the effectiveness of a custom classification embedding model on the Cohere. This Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform provides access to Large Language Models (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) tools through an application programming interface (API). Our findings highlight the utility of AI platforms and LLMs in identifying and classifying confusion in online learners. With a substantial potential for the classification task to be dealt with by a custom model running on a third-party platform, researchers can focus on developing conversational agents to support learners with their confusion in courses in online learning platforms.","School of Computing and Information Systems, Athabasca University, Edmonton, Canada; School of Computing and Information Systems, Athabasca University, Edmonton, Canada; School of Computing and Information Systems, Athabasca University, Edmonton, Canada",G.

Artificial Intelligence Assisted Student Learning and Performance Analysis using Instructor Evaluation Model,"Student's proficiency in a subject may be gauged through the use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) (LMSs). Using a scoring algorithm to calculate the percentage of each student's attentiveness in the specific class, this system aims to increase the use of artificial intelligence approaches. The graph provided by this tool may be used to measure how well a student understands the material being taught. Data mining tools are increasingly being used in higher education to help students and administrators better understand and resolve educational and administrative difficulties. The majority of educational mining research focuses on replicating students' performance rather than instructors' performance. The course assessment questionnaire is a standard instrument for evaluating teachers' performance based on students' perceptions. There are a number of different ways for creating classification techniques in this system, from decision trees to support vector machines to machine learning techniques, including differential evolution. Comparing their answers to an actual course assessment question based on its accuracy, retention and sensitivity. Students' online conduct has become more accessible because to the use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions. These statistics have been utilized by several studies to predict student outcomes. A wide range of subjects and predictive characteristics collected from the LMS make it difficult to draw generalized statements about the processes that control student performance. To get started let's take a look at some of the most recent research' theoretical foundations and common predictions in the field of learning analytics. A total of 4,989 students took 17 blended courses with Moodle LMS at the same school, and both multi-level and conventional regressions are utilized to examine the impact of LMS predictor factors and between-course evaluation grades on student performance. Despite the fact that they were gathered inside a single institution, our studies demonstrate that the outcomes of predictive modelling varied greatly between courses. As a result, the predictive models' range of motion is constrained. The data from LMS also shows that early intervention and intermediate assessment grades have little (if any) relevance from LMS data.","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai; Department of Information Technology, Kalasalingam University, Srivilliputtur, Tamilnadu, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Saveetha School of Engineering, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai; Department of Information Technology, Sri Manakulavinayagar Engineering College, Puducherry; Department of Information Science and Engineering, Sir M Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology, Bengaluru; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, J P College of Engineering, Tenkasi, Tamilnadu, India; Dept of EEE, Francis Xavier Engineering College, Tirunelveli, India",N.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing in E-Learning Platforms: A Review of Opportunities and Limitations,"In recent decades, the world has witnessed an explosion of digitalization in various sectors, notably in education. Online learning platforms such as Moodle, Canvas, Claroline, Open edX, and Blackboard, have made significant strides in improving the learning process by enhancing flexibility and efficiency. Nevertheless, these tools do not fully meet the needs of learners and educators, primarily due to the static design and presentation of pedagogical content. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) present promising solutions to adapt content, navigation, and presentation in a more diverse and personalized manner for each learner. These advancements involve the deployment of techniques such as text analysis, automatic content translation, text classification, sentiment analysis, voice recognition, and recommendation systems. Consequently, this work aims to reveal the contributions and challenges of AI devices in education, focusing on the importance of using NLP in educational platforms to improve and adapt them to the needs of educators in content design and those of learners in terms of navigation and learning dynamics.","Departement of Physics, Laboratory of Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication, Faculty of Science, Chouaib Doukkali University, El Jadida, Morocco; Departement of Physics, Laboratory of Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication, Faculty of Science, Chouaib Doukkali University, El Jadida, Morocco; Departement of Physics, Laboratory of Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication, Faculty of Science, Chouaib Doukkali University, El Jadida, Morocco",M.

Student Engagement Dataset (SED): An Online Learning Activity Dataset,"Distance learning has become a popular educational medium, and the Internet has spread since the early 2000s. To leverage this phenomenon, learning analytics and data mining can provide insights into improving pedagogy and assessing student engagement. To this end, a student-centric dataset was constructed by extracting data from Universiti Malaya’s Moodle-based Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), which serves approximately 25,000 students annually. In this paper, we present the Student Engagement Dataset (SED). The dataset consists of 16,609 students and 2,407 courses. It contains information such as grades and daily logged online activities (approximately 12 million data points), including temporal data across four tables. The tables include student engagement features created by aggregating raw activity data. Here, we present the dataset’s properties and describe the data collection, selection, and processing steps. Correlation analysis of student engagement features showed a statistically significant but weak negative correlation between the number of courses, early morning logins, assignments, and top students’ performance. SED is expected to present new opportunities for researchers in the learning analytics domain.","Department of Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Department of Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",M.

Generative AI Enabled Robotic Process Automation: A Practical Case Study,"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can be used to automate highly repeatable business processes. However, it might struggle in non-deterministic situations where some sort of understanding is required. For example, it can automatically load all the students’ answers from an online examination, but it cannot mark them without the help of some kind of AI. This significantly limits its capabilities. Generative AI and applications such as ChatGPT have many potential applications as they can generate and understand natural language text, making them ideal candidates for addressing the limitations of RPA. In this paper, we propose a practical way of enhancing Robotic Process Automation using Generative AI. This work also includes a practical case study that uses Visual Studio C#, Selenium, and ChatGPT for automatically grading students’ examination attempts in the Moodle Learning Management System. The results show that the application managed to grade the students with minimal human input.","School of Computer Sciences, University of Wollongong in Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Department of Computer and Software Technology, University of Swat, KPK, Pakistan; School of Computer Sciences, University of Wollongong in Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Department of Computer and Software Technology, University of Swat, KPK, Pakistan",A.

Developing Character Education based on Gamification: A Study of Gamification for E-Learning,"The gamification approach is one approach that can increase learner engagement and motivation in the learning process. Much research on the gamification approach is more about design, especially to increase students' motivation and engagement in learning. However, few systematic gamification designs are still used to generate character education values. Some studies show that character education values can be developed by elaborating and sharpening some elements in gamification and gamification approach design. Therefore, this research explores information about methods and implementation with a gamification approach to e-learning for character education. This research uses a literature study method with PICOC analysis with data collection using gamification based on character education as the main keyword of the research. The results of this study show that gamification design on e-learning leads more to developing creative character education values and hard work. This is because the application of e-learning with a gamification approach uses existing platforms such as MOOC, Kahoot, Quiz, and Moodle. Further research is needed to design gamification by integrating learning methods so that learning used to strengthen character education can be achieved.","Doktor Ilmu Teknik, Universitas Udayana, Indonesia; Teknik Elektro, Universitas Udayana, Indonesia; Teknik Elektro, Universitas Udayana, Indonesia; Teknik Elektro, Universitas Udayana, Indonesia; Teknik Informatika, University Atmajaya, Yogyakarta, Indonesia; Humanity-Oriented Science and Engineering, Kindai University, Jepang; Teknologi Informasi, Institut Agama Hindu Negeri Tampung Penyang, Palangka, Indonesia",N.

Transfer Learning and Custom Loss Applied to Transformer-Based Text Translation for Sign Language Animated Subtitles,"Online learning’s rise presents unique challenges for the deaf community, particularly in understanding educational videos. This research addresses the problem by proposing a solution to generate animated subtitles in the Indonesian Sign Language System, namely SIBI (Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia). The existing method produces word-by-word animations from directly recognized spoken text that are too fast and difficult to follow. We developed a text translation model for the Moodle application to shorten the original spoken text of the educational videos into SIBI text without losing the crucial information. We propose transfer learning to train our transformer-based models and use a custom loss function to ensure alignment with the SIBI dictionary. Pre-trained models mBART50 and NLLB200 were fine-tuned on the SIBIVID-MP12 dataset, which was created in collaboration with Special Education teachers. Experiment results show that the proposed method improves translation metrics significantly, with the best performance observed for the NLLB200 model fine-tuned with our proposed custom loss, achieving sacreBLEU, chrF++, METEOR, and ROUGE-L improvements of 71%, 9.79%, 22.92%, and 14.55%, respectively.

Using the Git Version Control System to Replace a Learning Management System,"For several years now, but with special force since the beginning of the COVID contingency, higher education professors have turned to telematic tools that help teachers manage the work with which their students practice and demonstrate their progress in class– Tasks, practices, projects, exhibitions and more. The systems that, over the last two decades, have been most used for this purpose are called Learning Management Systems (LMS); The best known is undoubtedly Moodle, but there are a large number of options for this. Based on the empirical observation of a rejection by students of the use of these systems, the authors made the decision to completely replace their use with that of a version control system widely used for software development, Git, specifically for teaching students of the Computer Engineering career, for the Operating Systems course. This article presents the justification for choosing this platform, and the evaluation of the experience after eight semesters using it.","Facultad de Ingeniería (FI) and Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas (IIEc), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Coyoacán, Ciudad de México, Mexico",G.

Leveraging Inference: A Regression-Based Learner Performance Prediction System for Knowledge Tracing,"Learner modelling and performance prediction have seen numerous advances in the last decade which include Neural Network (NN) based approaches like Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Factorisation machines for estimation and automatic detection of skill tags amongst others. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which try to tailor each user’s learning by adaptively scheduling problems depend upon learner modelling and the accurate prediction of learner performance to operate. ITSs have led to the availability of large-scale datasets enabling the development of richer models. The classical Bayesian approaches have been overtaken by faster, more scalable and more accurate models like DASH and DAS3H. Despite recent gains in prediction accuracy by NN based models, they are getting increasingly complex and computationally expensive. The issues with the scalability of recent models hinder their widespread adoption in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) which outnumber ITSs by several magnitudes. NN models have very limited transferability. In this paper, the state-of-the-art approach involving Logistic Regression (LR) is examined on 8 public datasets and an alternative system based on variational encoding is presented. The proposed system outperforms the LR model in accuracy for 4 datasets. The new model is applied to the biggest Educational Data Mining (EDM) dataset available and shows that training on such a large dataset is possible without batching, which is not possible by other techniques. The paper focuses on the increase in scalability with a smaller memory footprint (requiring 22.5 ± 7.45 % less memory). The system also had a reduction in runtime for 5 among the 8 datasets. However, the variance in reduction is high with an average of  $10.12\pm 21.55 \%$  reduced run times. The proposed system was developed specifically for lightweight MOOCs with limited Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle. By estimating a learner ability parameter, the proposed system provides richer information to downstream applications like adaptive scheduling. The proposed model retains a high level of interpretability and transferability.","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",A.

Extending and Evaluating Usability Heuristics for Educational Website in Fiji,"Learning Management Systems (LMS) has recently gained a lot of popularity as an effective tool for improving education while promoting distance and flexible learning in Fiji. eLearning platforms should be able to possess usability features, including user-friendliness, ease of use and satisfaction of user requirements. With the diverse number of universities and courses globally, LMS websites created revolutionary changes in the educational sector. With these innovations, it is vital to ensure the effectiveness of educational sites by evaluating the usability interfaces, as there is minimal study on the effectiveness of websites, especially for LMS. This research intends to fill this gap by extending and evaluating the usability heuristics of educational website interfaces for better detection of usability problems, simultaneously running a survey to determine Moodle usage on different devices among different users in Fiji.","Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Fiji National University, Nadi, Fiji; Department of Office Administration/Library and Information System, Fiji National University, Nadi, Fiji; School of Science and Technology, The University of Fiji, Saweni, Fiji; Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Fiji National University, Nadi, Fiji",M.

Automatic Formative and Motivational Feedback Personalized for Introductory Programming Course,"The teaching and learning of the first programming language course, commonly called CS1 (Computer Science 1), is a reported challenge for undergraduate students in different majors and universities. In general, these courses have a high failure rate at institutions around the world. At the same time, there has been an increase in the usage of automated feedback tools for programming language courses. These tools present feedback to help the students know if their code is correct or incorrect while studying. This automatic feedback is important for student learning. In this context, this paper presents the AsPin plugin, developed for the virtual learning environment, which uses the student's profile to provide feedback (messages and advice) to personalize their learning. The automatic feedback helps the student understand where they made mistakes, delivers motivational messages so that the student continues to learn, and points to further academic materials so that the student spends more time studying what they need. This feedback is also personalized for the student's profile, as at the beginning of the course, the student fills out a form with basic information, for example, whether or not they already have programming experience and their major. The plugin was developed for the Moodle platform, a free and open-source virtual learning environment with CodeRunner, an automated grader for multi-programming languages. The AsPin plugin was developed for the CS1 course in Python language by students and instructors from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia. The plugin presented in this paper was evaluated by undergraduate students taking different majors, which has a high student acceptance rate. This paper presents the applied methodology, the development of the plugin, as well the performance evaluations and perceptions of students from the University of Brasilia in two academic semesters in 2022.","Depart. of Comp.

Intelligent Prediction-Intervention approach to Support Students' Success in Web-based Learning Environments: A Case Study in Higher Education,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for distance learning has significantly increased in higher education institutions. This type of learning is usually supported by Web-based learning systems such as Massive Open Online Courses (Coursera, edX, etc.) and Learning Management Systems (Moodle, Blackboard-Learn, etc.). However, in this remote context, students often lack feedback and support from educational staff, especially when they face difficulties or challenges. For that reason, this work presents a Prediction-Intervention approach that (a) predicts students who present difficulties during an online learning course, based on two main learning indicators, namely engagement and performance rates, and (b) offers immediate support to students, tailored to the problem they are facing. To predict students’ issues, our approach considers ten machine learning algorithms of different types (standalone, ensemble, and deep learning) which are compared to determine the best performing ones. It has been experimented with a dataset collected from the Blackboard-Learn platform utilized in an engineering school called ESIEE-IT in France during 2021-2022 academic year, showing thus quite promising results.","Centre de Recherche en Informatique, Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, Paris, France; Centre de Recherche en Informatique, Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, Paris, France; LA Recherche en Intelligence Artificielle, ENSI, University of Manouba, Tunisia; Centre de Recherche en Informatique, Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne, Paris, France; Multimedia, InfoRmation Systems and Advanced Computing Laboratory",T.

Log Analyzer for English Proficiency Test Cheating Detection,"Online learning is one of the learning methods implemented by many educational institutions. One of the implementations is the online English Proficiency Test (EPT) with Moodle LMS as the examination platform. However, in practice, some cheating still occurs, and many examinees in the online EPT exam make it challenging to analyze the data and detect cheating. Knowing this problem, this paper proposes a log analyzer framework that could detect cheating in online EPT exams in real time using log data as the analysis data. While also implementing proactive forensic practices and digital forensics readiness in the system. The waterfall method was adopted to develop the log analyzer framework by developing the capability of data acquisition and replication, identifying features that can indicate cheating, implementing isolation forest machine learning models for cheating detection, and reporting the analysis results from data that can be used for further processing. The functional test of the system states that the log analyzer framework's ability to acquire data, detect cheats, and create reports is functioning successfully. These functions demonstrate the log analyzer's ability to strengthen the security of online EPT examinations.","Informatics Faculty, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia; Informatics Faculty, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia; Informatics Faculty, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia",Q.

The Intersection of Usability Evaluation and Machine Learning in Software Systems,"Usability evaluation is crucial for software systems to promote user goal achievement based on effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Usability fosters user adoption and retention in software systems. The traditional subjective approach usually utilizes questionnaires, user testing, and heuristics with potential bias embedded. On the other hand, there's limited research on automatic objective evaluation found on usability with ML. Therefore, this paper analyzes the intersection between usability evaluation and ML in software systems to show the current state of the art and potential research directions. In this context, we propose a methodology with ML techniques for usability evaluation on a software system (Moodle) based on user interaction data and quantitative subjective answers. This strategy fosters a predictive analysis with data-driven decision-making for software systems improvement in the long term.","Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, USA; Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, USA",R.

High Availability in Private Cloud: Approaches and Possibilities,"Cloud computing, typically provided by large infrastructure providers, allows companies to utilize services efficiently under the premise of cost reduction. Known as the “public cloud,” this model contrasts with the “private cloud,” often perceived as costly and complex to implement. However, when high availability is required, the complexities of both models align, and the costs associated with public cloud services can become prohibitive. This paper explores the technical feasibility and economic viability of deploying private cloud infrastructure using refurbished hardware. It presents a detailed architecture incorporating Canonical MaaS for Metal-as-a-Service (MaaS), OpenNebula for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and Incus for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), with Moodle as the application layer case study. The study finds that private clouds, especially those utilizing refurbished hardware, not only offer a costeffective alternative to public clouds but also enhance security with complete control over data and systems, provide customizable self-management to meet specific organizational needs, utilize existing resources more efficiently for greater sustainability, and ensure technological sovereignty by reducing dependency on public cloud providers. These benefits collectively underscore the strategic advantages of adopting private cloud infrastructures in certain contexts.","Dpt. of Computer Science, Universidad Católica de Temuco, Temuco, Chile; Dpt. of Computer Science, Universidad Católica de Temuco, Temuco, Chile; Dpt. of Computer Science, Universidad Católica de Temuco, Temuco, Chile",A.

On Some Methods of Digital Assessment for Mathematical Courses,"While the practice in higher education has begun to reflect a much greater emphasis on active and, more generally, experiential approaches to learning, mathematics instruction, when set against these broader trends, still has some distance to travel. Information and communication technologies (ICTs), and computer algebra systems (CAS) in particular, open up new possibilities for the teaching of mathematics, providing dynamic and interactive approaches to the representation of ideas that enable students to explore concepts that, when presented in other guises, are well beyond their capability. The implementation of hybrid learning models, mixing traditional and digital pedagogies, raises major challenges: from choosing the right software to requiring complete teacher training. The COVID-19 pandemic strongly accelerated online education by providing for large-scale usage in learning management systems (LMS) such as MOODLE and CooSpace. These platforms, however, have been instrumental in keeping educational continuity; effective assessment strategies within the online environment still lag. The potential of integrating ICTs and CAS into mathematics education in enhancing student learning outcomes exists but requires surmounting technical, pedagogical, and logistical challenges. The paper explores some of the methods relevant to such questions as the roles of ICTs in experiential learning, the efficacy of hybrid models of teaching, and the establishment of frameworks for assessment online. Grounded in the critical review of current practice and exploration of innovative strategies, this research intends to have added to the discourse on how best mathematics education can be optimized within the digital age so that all students benefit from a comprehensive, engaging, and effective learning experience.","Department of Applied Quantitative Methods, Faculty of Finance and Accountancy, Budapest Business University, Budapest, Hungary; Department of Applied Quantitative Methods, Faculty of Finance and Accountancy, Budapest Business University, Budapest, Hungary; Department of Mathematics, Institute of Computer Engineering, University of Dunaújváros, Dunaújváros, Hungary; Department of Applied Quantitative Methods, Faculty of Finance and Accountancy, Budapest Business University, Budapest, Hungary",A.

User to Vector: Encoding User Behavior From Co-Occurrence of Observations,"In this study, we propose the User2Vec framework, a novel approach for capturing user behavior based on the co-occurrence of user activities. User behavior modeling is essential for understanding relationships in areas such as e-learning and marketing, but most existing methods rely on explicit social interaction data, which are not always available. We propose the User2Vec framework, inspired by the Word2Vec model, to encode user activity into dense vector representations using the temporal co-occurrence of active users. This approach allows the identification of user groups without relying on direct interaction data. The proposed methodology involves preprocessing user activity logs, extracting temporal co-occurrence features, and applying clustering techniques such as k-means and spectral clustering to reveal latent structures. These clustering methods were chosen for their balance of computational efficiency and effectiveness in capturing implicit relationships. The approach is experimented on a dataset from a university e-learning platform, where student logs are processed to cluster users according to their co-occurring actions. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms previous co-occurrence-based methods in terms of clustering accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the significant potential of the proposed framework in applications such as personalized learning and community detection.","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy",A.

Behavioural intentions toward information communication technology integration in secondary education: Modelling the effects of students’ attitudes,"Technology integration in education holds promise for sustainable education regarding access, inclusion and quality, referencing the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4. Nonetheless, attitudes toward technology have been identified in the literature as a precursor to technology uptake for technocentric pedagogy. While contemporary studies have investigated the attitude variable and its effects on students’ behavioural intentions toward technology integration, it has been done holistically without specificity in terms of attitudes toward particular technologies. How these various attitudes toward different technologies and online pedagogy relate among themselves, leading to the prediction of intention behaviour towards technology integration in secondary classrooms, is not fully known. Consequently, this study formulates a model that specifies how attitudes toward learning management systems, attitudes toward computers, attitudes toward the Internet, and attitudes toward online learning intricately influence each other in determining students’ behavioural intentions to integrate technology into their learning. The study adopted a quantitative approach based on a correlational survey design and elicited responses from a stratified proportionate and simple random sample of 386 secondary school students through a questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques. Results from the structural model analysis revealed that students’ attitudes toward learning management systems, the Internet, and online learning directly determine students’ behavioural intentions toward ICT integration in their learning. Moreover, attitudes toward the learning management system and the Internet predicted students’ attitudes toward online learning. Furthermore, attitudes toward computers determined both students’ attitudes toward learning management systems and the Internet. Overall, the specified model determined about 40% variance in explaining students’ attitudes and their intention behaviour towards ICT integration in their learning. These findings provide an essential foundation for policy and practice towards technology integration in secondary education. © 2025 The Author(s)","Bervell, Brandford University of Cape Coast, College of Distance Education, Maths, Science & ICT Department, Cape Coast, Ghana; Armah, Justice Kofi University of Cape Coast, Directorate of Academic Planning and Quality Assurance, Cape Coast, Ghana; Mireku, Dickson Okoree St. Augustines College (GES), Cape Coast, Ghana; Sarpong, Nana Akwasi Prempeh School of Distance Education, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia; Annamalai, Nagaletchimee Humanities and Social Sciences, Research Centre, Ajman University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates","Bervell, Brandford and Armah, Justice Kofi and Mireku, Dickson Okoree and Sarpong, Nana Akwasi Prempeh and Annamalai, Nagaletchimee",10.1016/j.teler.2025.100193,UNKNOWN,27725030,Telematics and Informatics Reports,2025,False
Enhancing electric vehicle battery lifespan: integrating active balancing and machine learning for precise RUL estimation,"Electric vehicles (EVs) rely heavily on lithium-ion battery packs as essential energy storage components. However, inconsistencies in cell characteristics and operating conditions can lead to imbalanced state of charge (SOC) levels, resulting in reduced capacity and accelerated degradation. This study presents an active cell balancing method optimized for both charging and discharging scenarios, aiming to equalize SOC across cells and improve overall pack performance. The proposed system includes two balancing strategies: a charging balance that redistributes excess charge from high-SOC cells to maximize capacity, and a discharging balance that addresses low-SOC cells to extend discharge duration. Experimental results confirm that this method effectively reduces SOC disparities, enhancing both charging and discharging capacities. Additionally, to accurately predict battery lifespan and remaining useful life (RUL), seven machine learning models are evaluated using R-squared (R2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Among these, k-nearest Neighbors and Random Forest models deliver the highest accuracy, achieving R2 values of 0.996 and above with low MAE, demonstrating strong predictive capability. The integration of active balancing and RUL prediction enables a feedback loop where balanced SOC levels promote battery health, and RUL predictions inform optimal balancing strategies. This comprehensive approach advances EV battery management, enhancing lifespan and reliability through proactive balancing and predictive insights. © The Author(s) 2025.","Sultan, Yara A.

Advances in image-based estimation of snow variable: A systematic literature review on recent studies,"Accurately estimating snow hydrology parameters, including snow coverage mapping and snow depth, plays a significant role in comprehending water resource dynamics, flood forecasting, and environmental management in regions influenced by snow cover. These parameters are critical for hydrological models that simulate snowmelt and runoff, which are essential for predicting water availability and managing water resources in snow-covered areas. Traditional methods for estimating these parameters often rely on manual measurements or simplistic models, which can be inadequate for capturing the complexity of snow-related processes. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging deep learning techniques for snow hydrology parameter estimation, offering the potential to overcome these limitations. This review paper comprehensively analyzes the current state, challenges, and future directions of image-based approaches in snow hydrology parameter estimation. By harnessing the power of automated methods, particularly deep learning, these approaches demonstrate the ability to capture intricate spatial and temporal relationships present in image data. A comparative analysis on image-based methods highlights the strengths of automated approaches, including scalability and accuracy. Integration of image sensors, such as satellite imagery and crowd-sourced data, is explored as a crucial component of snow hydrology parameter estimation. Various satellite image sources, including Sentinel 1-2, Landsat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are discussed in terms of their suitability for snow hydrological applications. Despite the promise of image-based approaches, challenges remain, including data availability, model interpretability, and transferability. The paper identifies future research directions, emphasizing the exploration of novel deep learning architectures and uncertainty quantification techniques to address these challenges. In conclusion, this review underscores the importance of image-based approaches for advancing snow hydrology parameter estimation. By addressing challenges and maximizing potential impact, these approaches have the potential to revolutionize snow hydrological modeling and environmental management. © 2025 The Authors","Demil, Getnet Center for Machine Vision and Signal Processing, University of Oulu, Finland; Haghighi, Ali Torabi Water, Energy and Environmental Engineering Unit, University of Oulu, Finland","Demil, Getnet and Haghighi, Ali Torabi and Klöve, Björn and Oussalah, Mourad",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132855,UNKNOWN,00221694,Journal of Hydrology,2025,False
Towards Trustable Intelligent Clinical Decision Support Systems: A User Study with Ophthalmologists,"Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) presents significant opportunities for improving healthcare delivery, particularly in fields like ophthalmology. This paper explores the usability and trustworthiness of an AI-driven CDSS designed to assist ophthalmologists in treating diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, we created a CDSS and evaluated its impact on efficiency, informedness, and user experience through task-based semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with 11 ophthalmologists. The usability of the CDSS was rated highly, with a SUS of 81.75. Additionally, results show that participants felt like the CDSS would improve their efficiency and informedness with one major aspect being integrating Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data into a single interface. Additionally, we explored aspects of the trustworthiness of AI components, specifically OCT segmentation, treatment recommendation, and visual acuity forecasting. Through thematic analysis, we identified key factors influencing trustworthiness and clinical adoption. Results show that a larger degree of abstraction from input to output of a model correlates with decreased trust.

A new approach on self-adaptive trust management for social Internet of Things,"The emergence of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) represents a significant evolution of the traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. While earlier IoT systems prioritized the integration of intelligent devices, the SIoT paradigm shifts the focus toward enabling social interaction and collaboration among connected entities. Within the SIoT, various nodes can autonomously establish social connections to access the desired services. Given the dynamic and decentralized nature of this open environment, effective trust management becomes crucial. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have made significant progress in enhancing trust computing within the SIoT ecosystem. However, challenges such as scalability, dynamic behavior, and device resource limitations continue to pose difficulties. This study introduces SATM-SIoT, a decentralized self-adaptive trust management model for SIoT that integrates the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) control loop. By adjusting thresholds based on perceived hostile behavior, this model effectively identifies malicious devices, enhancing adaptivity in trust management. To address resource limitations and ensure scalability, our model assigns trust evaluation tasks to Fog nodes, leveraging their distributed computational power. We utilize ML techniques, specifically multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to analyze device behavior and assess trustworthiness. Federated learning (FL) enhances local ML models, enabling collaborative learning and incremental updates based on new data to adapt to the dynamics of SIoT. The primary goal of SATM-SIoT is to improve overall trustworthiness and accurately detect malicious devices while tackling challenges related to scalability, dynamic behavior, and resource constraints. We conducted experiments on a simulated SIoT network to validate our model. The results show that SATM-SIoT effectively identifies almost all malicious devices in a SIoT network. Utilizing the FL technique and MAPE-K loop led to an average increase in Success Rate of 7% and 9%, respectively. © 2025","Moeinaddini, Elham Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran; Nazemi, Eslam Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Moeinaddini, Elham and Nazemi, Eslam and Shahraki, Amin",10.1016/j.comnet.2025.111187,UNKNOWN,13891286,Computer Networks,2025,False
Improved multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based integrated control for mixed traffic flow in a freeway corridor with multiple bottlenecks,"A major challenging issue related to the emerging mixed traffic flow system, composed of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), is the lack of adequate traffic control measures, especially in a large freeway corridor with multiple bottlenecks. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning exhibits significant advantages, such as fast response, high flexibility, strong adaptability, low computational burden, and collaborative optimization. These features enable it to achieve superior efficiency and robustness in handling dynamically changing traffic environments and large-scale traffic control problems. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Integrated Traffic Control (ITC) strategy based on an Improved Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IPMATD3) algorithm in the mixed traffic environment (abbreviated as IPMATD3-based ITC). Specifically, the proposed IPMATD3-based ITC approach seeks to coordinate multiple Ramp Metering (RM) and Variable Speed Limit (VSL) controllers along a freeway corridor, with the objectives of improving traffic mobility and efficiency, enhancing safety, and reducing emissions. The proposed method utilized a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm to learn the joint actions of all traffic controllers in a high-dimensional state and action spaces. A hybrid reward function is developed by synchronously considering the above objectives to optimize traffic control performance. Then, the rank-based prioritized experience replay mechanism is incorporated into the conventional MATD3 algorithm to improve learning efficiency. A real-world freeway corridor is selected to test the proposed control method. Moreover, its performance is compared with the several state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable control performance at a 10% CAV Penetration Rate (PR), effectively reducing the spatiotemporal extent of freeway traffic congestion. The proposed method outperforms other approaches in improving freeway traffic efficiency, mobility, safety, and environmental sustainability. Increasing the PR can improve the performance of various methods and benefit traffic operations. However, when the PR reaches higher levels, the marginal benefits of further increases become less pronounced. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Han, Lei Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University, 4800 Cao'an Rd., Shanghai, 201804, China; Zhang, Lun Department of Urban Planning, Tongji University, 1239 Si'ping Rd., Shanghai, 200092, China","Han, Lei and Zhang, Lun and Pan, Haixiao",10.1016/j.trc.2025.105077,UNKNOWN,0968090X,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2025,False

Cloud-enabled e-commerce negotiation framework using bayesian-based adaptive probabilistic trust management model,"Enforcing a trust management model in the broker-based negotiation context is identified as a foremost challenge. Creating such trust model is not a pure technical issue, but the technology should enhance the cloud service negotiation framework for improving the utility value and success rate between the bargaining participants (consumer, broker, and service provider) during their negotiation progression. In the existing negotiation frameworks, trusts were established using reputation, self-assessment, identity, evidence, and policy-based evaluation techniques for maximizing the negotiators (cloud participants) utility value and success rate. To further maximization, a Bayesian-based adaptive probabilistic trust management model is enforced in the future broker-based trusted cloud service negotiation framework. This adaptive model dynamically ranks the service provider agents by estimating the success rate, cooperation rate and honesty rate factors to effectively measure the trustworthiness among the participants. The measured trustworthiness value will be used by the broker agents for prioritization of trusted provider agents over the non-trusted provider agents which minimizes the bargaining conflict between the participants and enhance future bargaining progression. In addition, the proposed adaptive probabilistic trust management model formulates the sequence of bilateral negotiation process among the participants as a Bayesian learning process. Finally, the performance of the projected cloud-enabled e-commerce negotiation framework with Bayesian-based adaptive probabilistic trust management model is compared with the existing frameworks by validating under different levels of negotiation rounds. © The Author(s) 2025.","Rajavel, Rajkumar Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Christ University, Bengaluru, 560074, India; Krishnasamy, Lalitha Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Nandha Engineering College, Tamil Nadu, Erode, India; Nagappan, Partheeban Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, India; Moorthy, Usha Department of Information Technology, Manipal Institute of Technology Bengaluru, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India; Easwaramoorthy, Sathishkumar Veerappampalayam Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Sunway University, No. 5, Jalan Universiti, Bandar Sunway, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Subang Jaya, 47500, Malaysia","Rajavel, Rajkumar and Krishnasamy, Lalitha and Nagappan, Partheeban and Moorthy, Usha and Easwaramoorthy, Sathishkumar Veerappampalayam",10.1038/s41598-025-92643-z,UNKNOWN,20452322,Scientific Reports,2025,False
Applying the adaptive cycle and resilience principles to understand and manage human-wildlife relations on the African savanna,"Interactions between human societies and natural systems are vastly complex, posing notable challenges for effective conservation. Here, we apply social-ecological systems thinking, the adaptive cycle framework, and resilience principles to enhance understanding and management of human-wildlife relationships on African savannas. Human-wildlife relations on African savannas have evolved dramatically over the millennia, from subsistence hunting to colonists’ fenced-in wildlife preserves to the rise of community-based natural resource management models. Much research has emphasized the importance of all potential stakeholders, including local communities, to be involved in wildlife conservation decisions. Though community involvement has improved conservation dramatically, future management policies and actions will require continuous learning to quickly adapt to the ever-changing global environment and growing urbanization of the region. Endowed with some of the greatest biodiversity on earth living near such a fast-growing human population, adaptive thinking will be vital to conserve African savannas. This framework can be used to improve how conservationists manage human-wildlife interactions on African savannas, especially as novel variables arise, and disturbances continue to change the management paradigm's current capacity to respond to the system. © 2025 Elsevier GmbH","Lasky, Monica Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Lasky, Monica and Sibiya, Muzi D. and Hull, Vanessa",10.1016/j.jnc.2025.126896,UNKNOWN,16171381,Journal for Nature Conservation,2025,False

Feature weights in contractor safety performance assessment: Comparative study of expert-driven and analytics-based approaches,"Current expert-based approaches to determining the weights of different safety management elements during contractor safety performance are time-consuming and potentially biased.Hence, this paper evaluates analytics-based approaches, i.e., supervised learning, cluster-then-predict and two-level variable weighting K-Means (TWKM) (an extension of the traditional K-Means clustering algorithm), against the Delphi method. In collaboration with an infrastructure developer, a dataset of 461 data points and 12 features describing subcontractors' inherent risks and safety assurance performance were collected. This paper showed that supervised learning improves recall by 21 % when compared with the Delphi method. This paper also highlights that changes in input features' distributions (or covariate shifts) across construction stages and projects can reduce the recall of the supervised learning model from 93 % to 50 %.

A novel wireless sensor network deployment for monitoring and predicting abnormal actions in medical environment and patient health state,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a crucial role in modern healthcare applications by sensing and communicating environmental and patient health data through wireless mediums. These networks enable real-time monitoring of patients, including the elderly and individuals with chronic conditions, offering significant benefits in surveillance and healthcare management. However, several challenges persist in implementing WSNs for healthcare. Real-time administration faces obstacles such as managing patients, medical infrastructure, and staff while ensuring timely treatment delivery. Moreover, accurately predicting diseases and providing precise treatment remains complex due to the diverse nature of medical data and the limitations of traditional systems. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach integrated with WSNs to address these challenges.

The proposed model (DCNN-LSTM) analyzes diverse data types, including numeric, alphanumeric, images, signals, and video, to accurately identify abnormal conditions and predict diseases. The system also generates real-time alerts for medical personnel, ensuring timely intervention. The proposed framework was validated using NS2 simulation software to model the WSN architecture and sensor node communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the DCNN-LSTM models achieved a classification accuracy of 96 % with a loss rate of 0.08, showcasing significant improvements over traditional approaches.

A spatiotemporal hydro-economic optimization modeling framework for integrating the conjunctive surface water and groundwater management with the crop pattern in an arid endorheic river basin,"The spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics under hydrological and hydrogeological conditions for the large endorheic river basins urgently need to implement spatiotemporal hydro-economic optimization for agricultural and environmental water demand. However, the current optimization lacks a comprehensive modeling framework that fully integrates the crop pattern with conjunctive use of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) and the consequent hydrological responses of river–lake-groundwater system. To address this challenge, a novel hydro-economic simulation–optimization framework was developed to alleviate the conflicts between agricultural and environmental sectors. The simulation model integrated a machine learning model namely kernel extreme learning machine with physically-based MODFLOW-NWT to significantly lower the huge computational burden. The optimization model based on the ɛ-MOMA algorithm was used to maximize net agricultural economic profit, GW and lake water storage by optimizing crop pattern, SW/GW irrigation and ecological water diversion. The framework was validated in the Yanqi Basin, an arid endorheic river basin with intensive agricultural expansion. The optimization results demonstrate that the net economic profit conflicts with the GW and lake water storage subject to water scarcity in the arid basin. The representative Pareto schemes including the extreme and compromising solutions are compared with the historical scheme to uncover the management implications. First, the net profit, the lowest lake level can be elevated by up to 14.7 % and 1.60 m, respectively, and the largest GW drawdown can be reduced by up to 3.83 m compared to the pre-optimized scheme. Second, the cash crop acreage dominates net profit and can be increased in the first two management periods to maximize agricultural economic objective. However, the schemes maximizing GW and lake water storage objective need to lower cash crop acreage and reduce irrigation water demand throughout the management period. Then, SW irrigation is largely elevated by collaboratively optimizing the ecological water diversion to significantly reduce GW irrigation in the last two management periods compared to the pre-optimized scheme. Therefore, it is of great importance for achieving the optimal trade-offs between agricultural and environmental water demand to implement conjunctive SW and GW management. Finally, the location-dependent crop pattern and water policy can be optimized to identify spatial adjustment with the preferred objectives in the different irrigation districts. Overall, these results advance our understanding of conjunctive water management and crop pattern regulation in the arid endorheic river basin, and testify the flexibility and usefulness of the hydro-economic optimization framework. © 2025","Song, Jian Key Laboratory of Groundwater Protection and Utilization——National Key Laboratory Cultivation and Development Site, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, 211100, China; Wu, Jianfeng Key Laboratory of Surficial Geochemistry, Ministry of Education, Department of Hydrosciences, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China; Wang, Jinguo Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute, National Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering, Nanjing, 210029, China","Song, Jian and Wu, Jianfeng and Wang, Jinguo and Yin, Ziyue and Yang, Yun and Lin, Jin and Wu, Jichun",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132972,UNKNOWN,00221694,Journal of Hydrology,2025,False
Continuous quality improvement across a South Australian health service and the role it plays in a learning health system: a qualitative study,"Introduction: Continuous quality improvement (CQI) initiatives are commonly used to enhance patient safety and quality of care. A novel South Australian Local Health Network (SALHN) Continuous Improvement Program (CIP009) has integrated a top-down model of executive-directed change initiatives, with a bottom-up approach of clinician designed interventions to address an organisational-wide goal of improved patient flow. This study evaluated the strengths and challenges of CIP009 implementation from the perspective of participants and deliverers. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in 2023/2024 to evaluate the implementation of CIP009 and 12 associated quality improvement projects. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with key stakeholders (executives, coaches and CIP009 fellows) and guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A document review and observations of CIP009 team meetings were also conducted. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis, then deductively mapped against the five CFIR domains. Results: Thirty-one participants were interviewed individually or in focus groups, two presentation days and six team meetings were observed, and 78 documents were reviewed. Seven key themes were identified highlighting key challenges and strengths of CIP009 implementation within the SALHN setting. These included four key strengths: the CIP framework and culture (the flexible framework, common language, training, and a culture of flattened hierarchy); the benefits of support from a dedicated, internal improvement Faculty (wrap around support from coaches); the advantages of an enthusiastic team member disposition and incentives (vested interests to enhance workflow and patient outcomes); and effective teams and team composition (teams comprised of senior clinician change agents). Three key challenges included: workforce and organisation-level challenges (individual workloads, workforce capacity, and data access); team cohesion, logistics and stakeholder engagement challenges (issues in the way teams worked together); and training and support shortcomings (the training course, and the top-down nature of CIP009). Conclusion: This evaluation identified that CIP009 was considered an effective multifaceted CQI program. The strengths of CIP009 support a learning health system (a data driven model, utilising systematic frameworks, with commitment from leadership, and a culture of continuous learning). Further integration of implementation science principles may support the program to overcome the key challenges identified. These findings will inform and guide improvement efforts within future iterations of CIP. © The Author(s) 2025.","Bierbaum, Mia IIMPACT in Health, Allied Health and Human Performance, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; Hillier, Susan Australian Institute of Health Innovation (AIHI), Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Ellis, Louise A.

Audit and group feedback in nursing home physician groups: lessons learned from a qualitative study,"Background: Audit and group feedback (A&F) is an instrument used to encourage healthcare professionals to improve the quality of care. Clinical practice was audited against a set of criteria and fed back to a group by a facilitator. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how physician group feedback sessions in nursing homes were conducted and to what extent they resulted in action planning. Methods: Fifteen group feedback sessions of the antibiotic A&F program within a nursing home network were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via the Framework Method for thematic analysis. The coding was performed using the existing Calgary A&F Framework and Cooke’s conceptual model of physician behaviors, and open inductive codes were added. Results: Elements of the conceptual model and the Calgary A&F Framework occurred within all group feedback sessions. The relationships within the group and with the facilitators were important elements when moving a group from interpreting the results to formulating action plans. Physician groups responded positively to the audit data, particularly if they were among the best performing. The data were met with doubt by physicians who did not recognize their own practice. When exploring potential reasons for lower guideline adherence, groups often considered data quality or external factors such as the choice of non-adherent treatment by locum staff. The degree of reflection on personal factors as explanations for low adherence and the extent to which groups identified learning and improvement opportunities varied: some groups were able to formulate action plans to address data problems and knowledge gaps, whereas others scheduled a follow-up meeting to develop action plans for treatment or prescribing practice changes. Conclusions: The facilitator was crucial in supporting the group in interpreting the results, steering the conversation towards sharing change cues, and helping the physician group in developing action plans. The degree of reflection and action planning varied by group. By implementing the lessons learned from this study, group feedback sessions can be refined, supporting participants in action planning. © The Author(s) 2025.","Yeung, Gary Y. C.

"Machine learning for smart water distribution systems: exploring applications, challenges and future perspectives","The advancements of the Internet of Things and Low-Power Wide-Area Network technology will accelerate in the next future the adoption of smart meters in water distribution systems, enabling the collection of a huge amount of fine-grained data. How to turn massive smart meter data into actionable knowledge will be the key point to limit water wastage and promote efficient and sustainable distribution. Although the collection of data worldwide is currently limited, the potential future impact of exploiting data-driven and machine learning methods is increasingly recognized in research and industry, as shown by many scientific works published in recent years. In particular, the interest in deep learning for smart water distribution systems is increasing, motivated by the ability to learn intricate patterns from big data. This work aims to provide an overview of the current research and identify challenges for future directions by conducting an application-oriented survey. Specifically, by analysing data characteristics and operational targets, we propose a new taxonomy that helps structure properly the macro-areas of water management into infrastructure analysis, demand analysis and water quality monitoring. Existing methods are discussed for each application under these three stages. In addition, we also discuss potential research directions, such as federated learning, incremental learning, probabilistic modeling and explainability and address broad issues like data availability and implications for privacy. © The Author(s) 2025.","Taloma, Redemptor Jr Laceda Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Cuomo, Francesca National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications (CNIT), Parma, Italy; Comminiello, Danilo Unidata S.p.A., Rome, Italy","Taloma, Redemptor Jr Laceda and Cuomo, Francesca and Comminiello, Danilo and Pisani, Patrizio",10.1007/s10462-024-11093-7,UNKNOWN,02692821,Artificial Intelligence Review,2025,False
Adaptive regulation of blood glucose levels: A triadic methodology incorporating super twisting and deep policy gradient,"The insufficiency of insulin secretion by the pancreas leads to elevated blood glucose levels (BGL) in individuals diagnosed with diabetes. Addressing this challenge, the artificial pancreas (AP) has emerged as a viable solution for the autonomous regulation of BGL through the continuous infusion of insulin. The proposed methodology employs a triadic approach to develop an intelligent closed-loop pancreatic system. First, a nonlinear controller, specifically the supertwisting sliding mode control (SSMC), is applied for the regulation of blood glucose. To enhance the quality and efficacy of the controller, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is then integrated to facilitate online updates of the SSMC coefficients. Finally, a sine–cosine algorithm (SCA) is formulated to optimize the hyperparameters of the DRL approach, addressing the challenges associated with the calibration of reinforcement learning algorithms. The developed system has been evaluated on six diabetic patients, involving various tests with differing BGL references, meal consumption, and the management of uncertainties. A comparative analysis with conventional methodologies further substantiates the superiority of the proposed SSMC-based DRL-SCA system, demonstrating an overall average superiority of approximately 61.13% in tracking performance compared to traditional control methods across various cases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Mohammadzadeh, Ardashir Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey; Alattas, Khalid A.

Machine learning-based prediction of coolant velocity profiles for thermal management and energy minimization across drive cycles,"This study addresses the limitations of existing battery thermal management systems (BTMS) that typically use constant coolant velocities to regulate the temperature excursions. In real-world applications, the power drawn, thereby, heat generation from batteries is not constant due to varying vehicle speeds, influenced by traffic and terrain. Under such conditions, maintaining constant coolant velocities may lead to overcooling, resulting in wasted energy, or undercooling, which could trigger thermal runaway. To overcome these challenges, a Smart Thermal Management System (STMS) is developed in the present study to identify smart velocity profile of the coolant for a user given conditions: (i) C-rate profile with respect to state of charge, (ii) initial temperature of the system (Tint), (iii) inlet temperature of the coolant (Tinlet), and iv) maximum allowable temperature of the batteries (TSPT). As a part of STMS development, an integrated serpentine channel based cold plate geometry, sandwiched between two pouch-type Li-ion batteries (LIBs), is designed numerically. Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), 600 samples were generated in the respective ranges of input parameters, namely, C-rate (0.5 - 5), initial DoD (0 - 0.8), initial temperature of the system (15 - 35 °C), inlet temperature of the coolant (15 - 35 °C), velocity of the coolant (0.01 - 0.5 m/s), and final DoD (0.05 - 0.85). Numerical simulations are conducted on the considered geometry using the NTGK model available in ANSYS Fluent for these 600 samples and the corresponding maximum temperatures on LIBs (Tmax) are noted. The GPR model was trained on these parameters to predict maximum temperatures, enabling the identification of smart coolant velocity profiles for popular drive cycles under specified user conditions (Tint,Tinlet,andTSPT). In addition, the percentage of energy being saved with smart velocity profile over constant velocity profile is also calculated. As the developed STMS model seeks information from user (Tint,Tinlet,andTSPT) to calculate smart velocity profile, it can be considered robust, independent of battery chemistry and BTMS designs, and applicable for any geographic or climatic conditions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Akula, Rajesh Department of Energy Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), Mumbai, 400076, India","Akula, Rajesh and Kumar, Lalit",10.1016/j.est.2025.115585,UNKNOWN,2352152X,Journal of Energy Storage,2025,False
A novel general practice registrar to supervisor feedback system for distance education in rural areas,"Background: Quality supervision in general practice (GP) is critical for the progress and satisfaction of GP registrars and for attracting future rural GPs. However, there is limited research to inform the implementation of feedback systems for enhancing supervision by rural supervisors, and no published evidence specific to distance education where a remote supervisor may be in a different practice and supervising from afar. This study aimed to develop and explore the outcomes of an easy-to-administer, safe and constructive, registrar-to-supervisor feedback system for a distance (or remote) supervision model. Methods: Participatory action research involved the design of a standardised short-form questionnaire and an administration, data analysis and feedback process between registrars and supervisors. The questionnaire was administered each year between 16–20 weeks of the first year of registrar training within a 3–4-year rural and remote GP training program—the Remote Vocational Training Scheme (RVTS) (2020–2022). Participation in the project was voluntary. Registrars were asked 12 standardised questions about supervision over three domains: bond strength, task agreement and goal setting. Responses were summed by domain and evaluated using set criteria of high (> 80%), medium (51% to 79%) or low (50% or lower). High- and medium-level narrative feedback reports were provided to supervisors. Low domain scores were followed up by relevant internal staff to negotiate and resolve issues.

"Using Business Simulation Games to Explore the Effects of Instructional and Technological Support on Students’ Psychological Needs, Cognitive Load, and Learning Achievement","Virtual-reality business simulation games (VRBSGs) have garnered attention in management education. However, investigating the design of efficient VRBSGs from an integrated perspective of social cognitive, self-determination, and cognitive load theories is crucial but under-addressed. Therefore, this study developed a VRBSG learning system to enhance students’ learning of retailing management in pet nutrition. Specifically, this study investigated the impact of technological and instructional support and how the VRBSG can affect students' psychological needs and cognitive load, improving their learning achievement. A total of 214 undergraduate students were recruited as research participants, and the data collected were analyzed using the partial least squares method. The results showed that the learning achievement of the experimental group playing the VRBSG improved significantly. Surprisingly, technological and instructional support did not significantly influence learning anxiety. The VRBSG design considered pet nutrition knowledge, the prompt of the VRBSG mechanism, and students’ successful feelings about the learning materials and content. This design can provide students with good feelings in a situated learning environment. These findings have significant implications for the use of VRBSGs in management education, particularly in the field of retailing management. © The Author(s) 2025.","Lin, Ying-Lien Department of Industrial and Information Management, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan","Lin, Ying-Lien and Wang, Wei-Tsong",10.1177/07356331241313128,UNKNOWN,07356331,Journal of Educational Computing Research,2025,False
A Symbolic AI Approach to Medical Training,"In traditional medical education, learners are mostly trained to diagnose and treat patients through supervised practice. Artificial Intelligence and simulation techniques can complement such an educational practice. In this paper, we present GLARE-Edu, an innovative system in which AI knowledge-based methodologies and simulation are exploited to train learners “how to act” on patients based on the evidence-based best practices provided by clinical practice guidelines. GLARE-Edu is being developed by a multi-disciplinary team involving physicians and AI experts, within the AI-LEAP (LEArning Personalization of AI and with AI) Italian project. GLARE-Edu is domain-independent: it supports the acquisition of clinical guidelines and case studies in a computer format. Based on acquired guidelines (and case studies), it provides a series of educational facilities: (i) navigation, to navigate the structured representation of the guidelines provided by GLARE-Edu, (ii) automated simulation, to show learners how a guideline would suggest to act, step-by-step, on a specific case, and (iii) (self)verification, asking learners how they would treat a case, and comparing step-by-step the learner’s proposal with the suggestions of the proper guideline. In this paper, we describe GLARE-Edu architecture and general features, and we demonstrate our approach through a concrete application to the melanoma guideline and we propose a preliminary evaluation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Bottrighi, Alessio Computer Science Institute, DISIT, University of Eastern Piedmont, Alessandria, Italy; Grosso, Federica Integrated Laboratory of AI and Medical Informatics, DAIRI – SS.

"Interconnections, trend analysis and forecasting of water-air temperature with water level dynamics in Blue Moon Lake Valley: A statistical and machine learning approach","Glacier-fed lakes serve as vital indicators of climate change, yet their temperature and water level dynamics are insufficiently studied, particularly in high-altitude basins. Examining these interactions is fundamental for the effective management of water resources in sensitive environments. This study investigates the interactions between air temperature (Ta), water temperature (Tw), and water level (WL) in the Blue Moon Lake Valley (BMLV), using advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques to address gaps in predicting these complex dynamics. We employed the Mann-Kendall test and statistical tests (F-test, t-test) to detect trends in Ta, Tw, and WL. Granger causality analysis explored directional relationships, while wavelet analysis captured variations across multiple timescales. Extreme value analysis assessed the influence of temperature extremes on WL. We compared the performance of machine learning models (GBM, XGB, DT, RF) and proposed a hybrid Quad-Meta (QM) model, which combines the strengths of these approaches, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Results indicated significant warming trends for Ta and Tw, with Ta increasing more rapidly, while WL exhibited stability. This indicates that hydrological factors may play a central role in moderating water levels. In terms of prediction, the QM model demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest RMSE (0.117 °C for Tw, 0.326 °C for Ta, and 0.002 m for WL) and the highest R2 values. We recommend continued global monitoring of Ta, Tw and WL in glacier-fed lakes and developing a hybrid QM model to enhance prediction accuracy in high altitude sensitive environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Shah, Shoukat Ali Chinese Antarctic Center of Surveying and Mapping, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China; Ai, Songtao State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China; Rack, Wolfgang Key Laboratory of Polar Environment Monitoring and Public Governance (Wuhan University), Ministry of Education, Wuhan, 430079, China","Shah, Shoukat Ali and Ai, Songtao and Rack, Wolfgang",10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124829,UNKNOWN,03014797,Journal of Environmental Management,2025,False
Integrating data mining with transcranial focused ultrasound to refine neuralgia treatment strategies,"Background: Neuralgia and other neuropathic pain are difficult to treat owing to their complicated etiology and a wide variety of responses to treatment. The novel neuromodulation technology transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has intriguing implications in targeted non-invasive brain stimulation. Patient-specific variables and neurological processes must be better understood to enhance tFUS for personalized therapy. Methods: In this research, a Machine Learning based Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Personalized Model (ML-tFUSPM) has been proposed to treat neuralgia by combining tFUS with data mining for personalized therapy. Data mining algorithms can examine patient demographics, pain factors, imaging data, and therapy outcomes to uncover response patterns and treatment predictors. According to these results, tFUS may be tailored to each patient by targeting brain regions involved in pain perception and control. Results: Initial studies show that data-driven models and tFUS enhance therapeutic efficacy, side effects, and accuracy. This collaborative endeavor uses data analytics and neuromodulation to customize neuralgia treatment. The new model's emphasis on targeted treatments and predictive analytics gives clinicians evidence-based tools to manage pain more effectively and personally, which might transform the industry. Comparative analysis: The experimental results show that the proposed method has a high accuracy ratio of 97 % compared to other methods. Conclusion: According to this study, computational principles and cutting-edge technology may lead to game-changing neurology and pain management advances. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Khan, Muhammad Attique Department of AI, Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia; Alsenan, Shrooq Information Systems Department, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, P.O.

Machine learning-centric prediction and decision based resource management in cloud computing environments,"In cloud data centers, precise resource prediction is a critical issue due to the dynamic environment, the presence of irrelevant data points, and the unpredictable nature of resource demand. An accurate prediction helps with resource management, cost planning, and improving cloud-related services, whereas an inaccurate prediction increases the budget because of unused and overused resources. The presence of dynamic and irrelevant data not only creates confusion in the model, resulting in inaccurate predictions, but also adds unnecessary complexity and cost to the entire process. To address these challenges, we propose an approach for multi-model methods that uses a sliding window method with an adjustable size to estimate important data points from the real trace. The current work conducts three experiments to assess the impact of unpredictable data and improve the models' performance for greater accuracy. Initially, we conducted the experiment on entire datasets, but this approach failed to produce accurate and efficient machine-learning models. The next fixed window technique provides activity recognition in real-time, making it suitable for applications that require immediate feedback or response. Finally, a novel Variable-Size Sliding Window (VSSW) is proposed that selects relevant data points that help to provide better performance. Additionally, a Model Selector Decision Support System (MSDSS) is designed for forecasting and optimizing resource demand. This system determines the best predictive model for a specific set of resources based on observations gathered over a defined time frame. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has improved the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by approximately 50.01% compared to the baseline method and approximately 31.75% compared to the fixed window size approach. Furthermore, the proposed model effectively addresses the challenge of predicting resource workloads in a dynamic environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Kashyap, Shobhana Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Punjab, Jalandhar, India; Singh, Avtar School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom","Kashyap, Shobhana and Singh, Avtar and Gill, Sukhpal Singh",10.1007/s10586-024-04787-8,UNKNOWN,13867857,Cluster Computing,2025,False

Dynamic alarm monitoring with data-driven ellipsoidal threshold learning,"Alarm systems are essential for the safety maintenance and health management of industrial systems. In this work, a dynamic alarm monitoring approach with data-driven ellipsoidal threshold learning is proposed, and an unknown system is directly learned using noisy data without model identification. An ellipsoid-based normal operating zone of the system variable is iteratively predicted based on system dynamics, and is updated as an external approximation of the intersection of a predicted ellipsoid and a measurement-based ellipsoid with an event-triggering condition. Then, the dynamic alarm limits are calculated for each dimension of the output by an ellipsoid-based quadratic equation, and a projection strategy from output points to the predicted ellipsoids is designed to have two different solutions to the equation. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic alarm monitoring approach is illustrated by experimental results on the sensor fault and actuator fault detection of an ultrasonic motor with and without an event-triggering condition, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Cui, Kaixin School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; Wu, Wenjing Department of Control Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, China","Cui, Kaixin and Wu, Wenjing and Shang, Jun and Shi, Dawei",10.1016/j.conengprac.2025.106282,UNKNOWN,09670661,Control Engineering Practice,2025,False
Real-time AI-driven quality control for laboratory automation: a novel computer vision solution for the opentrons OT-2 liquid handling robot,"The adoption of robotics and automated solutions in life sciences R&D has accelerated in recent years, driven by the need to process increasing sample volumes, protect laboratory staff from hazardous substances, and manage financial pressures. Various automation systems, each with distinct levels of sample processing, transportation tasks, and data management, are available to meet specific application requirements, with liquid handling robots taking pivotal positions in these systems. However, current liquid handling robots, such as the Opentrons OT-2, lack integrated vision-based quality control, which limits their accuracy and reliability. This study presents an AI-driven computer vision model designed to enhance quality control in laboratory automation.

Designing Persuasive Sustainable Waste Management Application for Urban Community in Malaysia: Understanding End-User Perspectives,"Solid waste management in urban areas in Malaysia is a critical issue that requires immediate attention. Waste management in Malaysia will become even more complex and difficult in the future due to the tremendous growth of the economy, urban population, and consumption patterns. The primary issue in this situation is the growing amount of waste production, which is outpacing the growth in disposal capacity. The Malaysian government has introduced the Waste Separation at Source Initiative (SSI), which mandates the Malaysian community to sustainable waste management practices in their daily lives. However, most urban Malaysians are unaware of these environmentally friendly waste management practices, despite the government's numerous attempts. Therefore, how to motivate the Malaysian community to adopt sustainable waste management practices has been of concern. A variety of persuasive technologies (PT) applications have been developed within sustainable HCI to promote sustainable waste management. However, its effectiveness among the urban community in Malaysia remains unknown. Accordingly, to develop an effective persuasive application for sustainable waste management, this study attempts to investigate end-user perspectives on effective persuasive design principles based on the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model. In-depth interview sessions were conducted with seven (7) participants, aged 31 to 47 years residing in various regions in Klang Valley. During interview sessions, participants were presented with several user interfaces (UIs) of waste management applications showing how each persuasive design principle had been applied. Next, we conducted a thematic analysis of positive and negative reviews of end-users to identify effective persuasive design principles to encourage sustainable waste management. Our results uncover 20 positives, 3 negatives, and 5 mixed views (positive and negative) perceptions. The positive perceptions fall under the following categories: reduction, tailoring, personalization, self-monitoring, simulation, praise, rewards, reminders, liking, social role, trustworthiness, expertise, surface credibility, real-world feel, verifiability, social learning, normative influence, and cooperation principles. Some of the negative perceptions include rehearsal, similarity, and recognition principles. Meanwhile, tunnelling, suggestion, authority, third-party endorsement, competition, social comparison, and social facilitation principles with mixed views (positive and negative) perceptions. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Optimized forgetting factor recursive least square method for equivalent circuit model parameter extraction of battery and ultracapacitor,"The hybridization of multiple energy sources is crucial for electric vehicle applications to achieve the same level of performance as that of internal combustion engine vehicles. Accurate power flow control depends on knowing the internal resistance of the battery and ultracapacitor (UC) at various charge levels. Therefore, this work focuses on prediction of the internal resistance of these sources at varying charge states and discharge rates. The first objective of this work is to establish a relationship between the source's state of charge (SoC) and open circuit voltage using a machine learning regression-based optimized curve-fitting model. This technique uses an algorithm to learn patterns from experimental data that minimize fitting errors and avoid overfitting, guaranteeing precise and broadly applicable forecasts. Thus, this model increases forecast accuracy and enhances generalization for dynamic operating conditions. The second objective is the application of a hybridized approach of heuristic optimization and forgetting factor recursive least square method, known as optimized forgetting factor recursive least square (OFFRLS) for extracting the source's internal electrical parameter at varying SoC and discharge rate. The forgetting factor in FFRLS can be challenging to adjust and can lead to overfitting since it affects the trade-off between stability and adapting to new input. As a result, the forgetting factor of the FFRLS algorithm is optimized at each time instant using heuristic optimization. This method is used to characterize battery and UC with second order Thevenin equivalent circuit model, which strikes a balance between complexity and accuracy and can capture dynamic behavior. For real time parameter estimation, an artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model trained using Bayesian regularization is developed for accurate and time-efficient source parameter estimation. When compared to OFFRLS, the time consumption can be decreased by using the ANN model for real-time estimate. Calibration tests, open circuit voltage tests, and dynamic discharge tests are performed in the lab with battery and UC for this research. By contrasting the estimated and actual terminal voltages of the sources, OFFRLS's effectiveness is illustrated. The measured terminal voltage of the battery differed from the estimated voltage by less than 0.5 %. The ability of the ANN to predict the internal resistance without overfitting was demonstrated by the strong correlation coefficients between the training and test data. Therefore, the proposed dynamic battery and UC models could be effectively used in applications such as energy management systems in electric vehicles. © 2025 The Author(s)","Prasanthi, Achikkulath Department of Electrical and Communication Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, P.O.

Development and preliminary evaluation of a decision coach training module for nurses in Norway,"Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a collaborative patient-centred process for arriving at informed healthcare decisions. Decision coaching can help support SDM when combined with patient decision aids. As part of a meta-curriculum “Ready for SDM” for training different healthcare professionals in SDM, we developed and pilot-tested a new module designed to train nurses as decision coaches. The study assessed nurses' perceptions of a decision coach training module, focusing on its feasibility, acceptability and its role in developing decision coaching capabilities. Methods: We used a two-phase approach guided by the Knowledge-to-Action Framework. In the first phase, we developed a decision coach training module. The second phase involved preliminary testing, using a descriptive design with qualitative and quantitative methods. We recruited a convenience sample of participants from two hospitals. Participants completed questionnaires at the end of Part A (classroom training). The assessment was informed by Kirkpatrick’s first three levels of educational outcomes: reaction (acceptability), learning (self-reported attitudes, intentions and confidence) and behaviour (practical application of decision coaching). A post-hoc inquiry investigated low participation in Part B of the coach training. Qualitative data underwent content analysis and quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: The development resulted in a decision coach training comprising a Part A (6 h) on SDM and decision coaching fundamentals and a Part B (1 h) which involved practical application of decision coaching in the participants’ own practice (audio recorded) with self-appraisal and individualised feedback. In preliminary testing with 19 nurses from seven clinical departments, 90% of participants rated Part A as acceptable and relevant to practice. Only one nurse completed Part B due to reluctance to audio record coaching sessions. The most reported perceived barrier was time constraints. Key perceived facilitators identified were interprofessional collaboration, management support and additional practical training. Conclusion: Decision coach training was feasible to deliver in the classroom. Participants reported Part A as acceptable and relevant to their practice. The second part, including an audio recording component, proved unfeasible. Further research should explore alternative methods for skill assessment and feedback in clinical practice. The results from this study will inform further refinement of the Norwegian Ready for SDM meta-curriculum and implementation strategies, particularly regarding the practical training components.

Precast components on-site construction planning and scheduling method based on a novel deep learning integrated multi-agent system,"The performance of precast construction relies on efficient on-site planning and scheduling of precast components. However, existing research primarily addresses either assembly sequence planning or construction process scheduling. The interactions between these elements and the dynamic nature of construction environments are often overlooked. This paper presents a novel two-stage planning and scheduling methodology that leverages a multi-agent system (MAS) and deep learning to account for construction environment, crews, materials, equipment, and assembly sequencing. First, precast components within the construction area are categorized into groups based on their coupling states. A knowledge-enhanced graph transformer is then introduced to determine the assembly sequence of intra-group components, considering their physical attributes and topological relationships. Subsequently, the MAS is developed to orchestrate the sequence of inter-group construction activities, addressing factors such as site congestion, worker movements, and material consumption. The knowledge-enhanced graph transformer is integrated into the MAS as a smart agent, to facilitate coordination between intra-group and inter-group planning. Finally, an engineering case is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that, compared to conventional MAS methods, the group-based plan leads to a 3.1 % reduction in construction time, a 6–10 % decrease in crew walking distance, and effectively mitigates assembly difficulties. These outcomes provide construction managers with innovative strategies and perspectives for optimizing construction workflows. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Jiang, Shanshan College of Civil Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","Jiang, Shanshan and Yang, Bin and Liu, Boda",10.1016/j.jobe.2025.111907,UNKNOWN,23527102,Journal of Building Engineering,2025,False
Review on applications of computer vision techniques for pipeline inspection,"Pipeline inspection is critical for ensuring the safety, integrity, and efficiency of energy and water transportation systems. Anomalies such as leaks, corrosion, and structural deformations can result in severe issues for the environment, economy, and public safety. Traditional inspection methods, such as manual visual inspection, magnetic flux leakage, and ultrasonic testing, face challenges such as high cost, labor intensity, and limited automation. Computer vision has emerged as a promising solution to overcome these limitations by enabling automated, efficient, and cost-effective anomaly detection in pipelines. This paper systematically reviews the application of computer vision techniques for pipeline inspection, including data collection, image processing, deep learning-based analysis, digital twin-based management. Key influencing factors, challenges, and opportunities are discussed. The findings reveal that, with appropriate preprocessing, deep learning models achieved high accuracy in detecting cracks, corrosion, deformation, and dents, but their generalization performance was dependent on dataset quality, quantity, and preprocessing techniques. This review highlights the potential and barriers of computer vision to revolutionize pipeline inspection, providing a structured foundation for future research and applications. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Liu, Yiming Department of Civil, Environmental and Ocean Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, 07030, NJ, United States; Moghaddas, Seyed A.

Comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence in surgery: a systematic review and perspectives,"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into surgical practice necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of its applications, challenges, and physiological impact. This systematic review synthesizes current AI applications in surgery, with a particular focus on machine learning (ML) and its role in optimizing preoperative planning, intraoperative decision-making, and postoperative patient management. Using PRISMA guidelines and PICO criteria, we analyzed key studies addressing AI’s contributions to surgical precision, outcome prediction, and real-time physiological monitoring. While AI has demonstrated significant promise—from enhancing diagnostics to improving intraoperative safety—many surgeons remain skeptical due to concerns over algorithmic unpredictability, surgeon autonomy, and ethical transparency. This review explores AI’s physiological integration into surgery, discussing its role in real-time hemodynamic assessments, AI-guided tissue characterization, and intraoperative physiological modeling. Ethical concerns, including algorithmic opacity and liability in high-stakes scenarios, are critically examined alongside AI’s potential to augment surgical expertise. We conclude that longitudinal validation, improved AI explainability, and adaptive regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure safe, effective, and ethically sound integration of AI into surgical decision-making. Future research should focus on bridging AI-driven analytics with real-time physiological feedback to refine precision surgery and patient safety strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Chevalier, Olivia Institut-Mines Telecom Business School, Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, Paris, France; Dubey, Gérard Surgical Oncology Department, National Institute of Oncology, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco","Chevalier, Olivia and Dubey, Gérard and Benkabbou, Amine and Majbar, Mohammed Anass and Souadka, Amine",10.1007/s00424-025-03076-6,UNKNOWN,00316768,Pflugers Archiv European Journal of Physiology,2025,False
Design and implementation of an automatic and self-adaptive NILM system using unsupervised learning and an IoT platform,"The consumption of electricity has been increasing significantly because of the rising population, the impacts of climate change, rapid urbanization, and the widespread adoption of electronic devices. Smart grids are essential for efficient energy management, integrating renewable resources, optimizing power systems, and addressing different power demands. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) enhances their effectiveness by disaggregating overall consumption into appliance-specific data, enabling precise monitoring and control. This paper presents the design and implementation of an IoT NILM system that incorporates a custom smart meter with a real-time event detection algorithm, a light IoT framework and an unsupervised learning approach for creating a self-adaptive dataset. Through RMS current and active/reactive power transient signals obtained from the event detection algorithm working in a real-world scenario, a 1D-CNN autoencoder model extracts characteristics from the time series and they are used to feed a K-means algorithm with auto K selection based on silhouette score. The clusters of the K-means achieved an accuracy of 99.22% in classification and became the dataset tailored for end users. For demonstrating the effectiveness and usability of the created dataset, a 1D-CNN classification model was implemented, achieving an accuracy of 98.53%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Munoz, Omar Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Blvd. Benito Juárez S/N, Mexicali, 21280, Mexico","Munoz, Omar and Ruelas, Adolfo and Rosales-Escobedo, Pedro F. and Ibarra-Esquer, Jorge E. and Reyes-Zamora, Ruben A. and Acuña, Alexis and Suastegui, Alejandro",10.1016/j.epsr.2024.111376,UNKNOWN,03787796,Electric Power Systems Research,2025,False
Proficiency-based grading: a potential solution learning without stressful exams,"This article describes the implementation of alternative grading (AG) strategies in an upper-division kinesiology and functional human anatomy course. Traditional point-based grading systems can negatively impact student mental health, decrease intrinsic motivation, and hinder learning. To address these issues, a proficiency-based grading approach was adopted, emphasizing clearly defined standards, growth-oriented feedback, progress-indicating marks, and penalty-free reassessment opportunities. Course assessments included weekly write-ups, movement analyses, and practical examinations, with flexible submission timelines and revision opportunities. Student feedback through microassessment revealed reduced stress levels, improved time management across courses, and deeper engagement with course material. Although implementation challenges existed, particularly around the initial faculty workload, the approach demonstrated significant learning gains while supporting student well-being. Our experience suggests that alternative grading strategies can maintain academic rigor while creating a more supportive and effective learning environment in science education.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article provides a practical implementation model for alternative grading in a science course, demonstrating how proficiency-based assessment can maintain academic rigor while reducing student stress.","Favero, Terence G.

Enhancing farmers' agency is a more effective extension paradigm: The case of soil health management in Africa,"CONTEXT: Climate change, volatile markets, and local resource variability pose significant challenges to sustainable agricultural development, particularly in soil health management. Despite extensive scientific research, the adoption of soil health solutions (SHS) among smallholder farmers in Africa remains low, highlighting a gap between research and practical implementation. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of farmer agency in enhancing the effectiveness of agricultural extension models, with a focus on soil health management. The paper aims to demonstrate how empowering farmers to innovate and adapt both local and scientific knowledge can lead to more efficient and sustainable agricultural systems. METHODS: This paper presents a review and perspective on the importance of farmer agency in sustainable soil management and agriculture extension more generally. It examines current limitations in research and extension systems, discusses the need for hyper-localisation of soil health practices, and proposes solutions for integrating farmer agency into agricultural development programmes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The review identifies several factors that enhance farmer agency, including education, economic opportunities, social networks, and supportive policies. It concludes that fostering farmer agency is crucial for improving soil health outcomes and driving sustainable agricultural transformation. The paper proposes guiding principles for policies and programmes aimed at elevating farmer decision-making power, including farmer-centred learning platforms, digital tools, and initiatives that strengthen social capital within farming communities. SIGNIFICANCE: This perspective highlights the critical role of farmer agency in bridging the gap between scientific research and practical implementation of sustainable soil management practices. By emphasising the importance of empowering farmers as autonomous decision-makers, the paper provides a framework for more effective agricultural extension and development programming. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the adoption and adaptation of SHS, leading to more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems in Africa. © 2025","Rickards, Chima International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), ICRAF House, United Nations Avenue – Gigiri, Village Market, P.

Serious Games for constipation management for people with intellectual disabilities: A scoping review and narrative synthesis,"Introduction: People with intellectual disability (PwID) are 2% of the UK population. Constipation and bowel movement (BM) problems (diarrhoea/faecal incontinence etc.) affects over a third of PwID and is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality. Pw ID rely heavily on outside support (family/professional carers/healthcare professionals), many of whom are ignorant to bowel related harms. There is significant stigma to discuss BM particularly constipation. Serious Games (SG) are increasingly used for education of health needs. This review examines if game-based technology can assist improving knowledge and reducing stigma of BM problems particularly constipation. Objective: To identify and gain evidence of SGs aimed at improving knowledge of BM management particularly constipation. Methods: A systematic search of publications between 2010 and 2024 was conducted following the PRISMA ScR statement for scoping reviews. The search inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed and overseen by an information specialist. PUBMED, EMBASE and PsychINFO databases were searched. Extracted variables included SG title, co-production and expert involvement, target outcome, evaluation methodology, effectiveness, sustainability and game platform. Results were narratively synthesised. Results: Of 2966 papers retrieved, three were selected for inclusion, none RCTs. All three included SGs aimed to teach BM management or recognition to healthcare workers/ professionals. Two studies evaluated game efficacy. No SGs were assessed after initial trials, none were implemented in clinical practice. Only one game successfully improved participant knowledge. All game creators consulted experts during game design, but none consulted patients. None discussed reducing stigma amongst their audience. Conclusion: Only one of three SGs identified improved BM knowledge in healthcare workers/professionals and was not specific to PwID. There is potential to co-produce with PwID and their carers a SG to support BM problems particularly constipation to reduce stigma, improve outcomes and be a templar for other similarly vulnerable groups like those with dementia. © 2025 The Author(s)","Daniel, Serena University of Exeter Medical School, Truro, United Kingdom; Bishop, Ruth Cornwall Intellectual Disability Equitable Research (CIDER) Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Truro, United Kingdom; Killner, Ellie Library, Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust, Truro, United Kingdom; Whight, Alison CIDER Peninsula School of Medicine, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, United Kingdom; Lennard, Sarah Games Design, Cornwall College, Camborne, United Kingdom","Daniel, Serena and Bishop, Ruth and Killner, Ellie and Whight, Alison and Lennard, Sarah and Howard, Stephen and Laugharne, Richard and Shankar, Rohit",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105832,UNKNOWN,13865056,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2025,False
An assessment for marine economic resilience and exploration of enhancement strategies: A case study of China,"The marine economy is widely considered the next frontier of economic growth and will make significant contributions to the overall economy of many countries. However, fluctuations in the development of the marine economy intensify the focus on risk management, thereby driving the pursuit of greater resilience. Through a thorough analysis of conceptual evolution of resilience, an evaluative framework has been developed, encompassing four aspects across which resilience is manifested and fourteen indicators selected from the economic, social, and ecological systems. Furthermore, marine economic resilience was calculated for China using the Critic-Topsis method and analyzed from the overall, temporal, and spatial perspectives. Then the relationship between spatial structure and the enhancement of resilience was investigated. The findings are as follows: (1) Marine economic resilience across all provinces and municipalities has been improving over time in China; Shandong Province and Guangdong Province stand out as particularly prominent examples in terms of their performance. (2) The updating and progressing aspect of marine economic resilience plays an increasingly pivotal role in the system's ability to respond to shocks. Advances in marine scientific research and the expansion of talent reserves bolster the learning ability to derive insights from such shocks, facilitating the system's resilience. (3) There are significant variations in marine economic resilience across different marine economic circles and among provinces within each circle, and spatial imbalances and lack of coordination can affect the overall improvement of marine economic resilience. An optimal spatial structure that promotes resilience features an appropriate degree of multicentricity. Therefore, to boost the development of marine economy, the enhancement of resilience should be a continuous focus, and the updating and progressing aspect of marine economic resilience supported by learning capabilities are crucial. It is also critical for coastal areas to strengthen cooperation to promote the overall marine economic resilience. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Wei, Youzhou College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Ocean University, China; Cui, Qing Shandong Branch, National Financial Regulatory Administration, China","Wei, Youzhou and Cui, Qing and Liu, Yihan",10.1016/j.marpol.2025.106597,UNKNOWN,0308597X,Marine Policy,2025,False
Supporting a bidirectional feedback process for self-assessment tasks in a digital learning environment,"Bidirectional Feedback may benefit students by facilitating learning success and goal achievement and can help teachers address students’ needs and/or assess and improve learning material. Current feedback practices have limitations, such as the difficulty for students to formulate understandable feedback for teachers, the effort required for students and teachers to engage in feedback dialogue, and the challenge for teachers to manage multiple feedback responses across a wide range of learning material. Thus, there is a need for computational support in a digital learning environment that facilitates bidirectional feedback creation, processing, and dialogue. To this end, we present a process model of bidirectional feedback, a conceptual design of a computational support to assist this process, and its implementation for the self-assessment task type in Moodle. It was implemented and evaluated in a distance learning course in a B.Sc. Computer Science program. With the use of computer-assisted support for the bidirectional feedback process, an increase in feedback from more students was observed and was related to more self-assessment tasks. Feedback included not only negative but also positive feedback. Teachers confirmed the usefulness of computational support as well as the usefulness and understandability of student-generated feedback messages, both for helping students and for assessing and improving the quality of assignments. © The Author(s) 2025.","Kasakowskij, Regina Center of Advanced Technology for Assisted Learning and Predictive Analytics (CATALPA), FernUniversität in Hagen, Universitaetsstr. 1, Hagen, 58084, Germany; Haake, Joerg M.

Improving hospital food and meal provision: a qualitative exploration of nutrition leaders’ experiences in implementing change,"Background: Recently, numerous initiatives have been taken to improve food and meals for hospital inpatients. Research providing in-depth knowledge on leading such improvement initiatives and implementing changes, specifically through facilitation within this multilevel context, is essential. This study aims to explore nutrition leaders’ experiences in implementing changes to improve food and meal provision for hospital inpatients, focusing on facilitation activities. Method: This is a qualitative interview study within the social constructivist paradigm. Participants were recruited through professional networks, advertisements, and snowballing. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with participants in leadership roles of food and meal improvement initiatives at Swedish hospitals. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically through an i-PARIHS lens. Results: Three themes of facilitation activities were identified: ‘Building Relationships’, ‘Placing Food and Meals on the Agenda’, and ‘Cultivating Skills’. Building relationships involved establishing connections between the service and clinical divisions. Creating common structures and multidisciplinary teamwork enabled collaboration across organisational boundaries. Placing food and meals on the agenda involved both initial and ongoing communication activities, as food and meal tasks were often considered low priority. Cultivating skills encompassed creating learning opportunities for implementing lasting changes, tailored to specific contexts and adopted within everyday practices. Conclusions: Collaboration between foodservice and clinical professionals, along with the dissemination of knowledge, appears to be important for implementing changes. Active leadership supports successful implementations by providing structured approaches, including feedback systems, and by contributing to the recognition of improvement initiatives, according to experiences shared during interviews. © The Author(s) 2025.","Wilandh, Emma Department of Food Studies, Nutrition and Dietetics, Uppsala University, Box 560, Uppsala, 751 22, Sweden; Skinnars Josefsson, Malin Division of Public Health Sciences, School of Health, Care and Social Welfare, Mälardalen University, Box 883, Västerås, 721 23, Sweden","Wilandh, Emma and Skinnars Josefsson, Malin and Persson Osowski, Christine and Mattsson Sydner, Ylva",10.1186/s12913-025-12499-x,UNKNOWN,14726963,BMC Health Services Research,2025,False
"Constraint first, shrinking next: A hybrid photovoltaic generation forecasting framework based on ensemble learning and multi-strategy improved optimizer","Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting is critical for effective smart grid management. However, PV power is highly dependent on weather variables, resulting in significant volatility and nonlinearity in generation patterns, which makes traditional forecasting methods often struggle to guarantee both accuracy and robustness at the same time. Although Pareto-front-based ensemble learning approaches partially mitigate these issues, the excessive generation of suboptimal solutions increases decision-making challenges for grid operators. To this end, this paper customizes a novel PV ensemble learning forecasting system based on Bi-Directional Guarantee (BIDG) and Pareto Front Shrinking (PFS). Specifically, the original Hippopotamus Optimizer (HO) is enhanced into a Multi-Objective Hippopotamus Optimizer (MOHO) using a crowding-distance-based multi-objective framework. To further enhance the algorithm's performance, low-discrepancy sequence initialization is adopted to improve the optimizer's exploration ability, and a perturbation operator is introduced to enhance convergence performance. The BIDG mechanism based on the improved MOHO is used as the weighting strategy for ensemble learning, which imposes dual constraints on the accuracy and robustness of the forecast and penalizes suboptimal solutions to improve the quality of the Pareto front. To further improve the quality of the Pareto front to simplify decision-making, we combine the Shrinking Method to Quantify Competition (SMQC) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to shrink the Pareto front. Numerical validation is conducted using seasonal local datasets from a PV plant in Australia's Northern Territory.

Implementing Learning from Excellence in a postanaesthesia care unit: a qualitative study of healthcare professionals’ experiences after six months,"Background: Prevailing efforts to ensure patient safety have primarily focused on learning from errors and adverse events (Safety-I). However, it is advocated that complex systems also learn from success (Safety-II) and focus on healthcare professionals’ well-being at work to increase resilience. Learning from Excellence is a British initiative designed to learn from successful practices and provide positive feedback to the staff. It has gained enthusiastic followers in several countries, including Norway. However, how it influences learning, well-being and quality improvement, has not been studied in-depth. This study intends to address these gaps.

Multivariate rolling decomposition hybrid learning paradigm for power load forecasting,"Very-short-term power load forecasting (VSTLF) is essential for supporting government planning in the transformation and expansion of power grids, as well as in the formulation of sustainable green development strategies. The traditional hybrid VSTLF method utilises future information using the one-off data decomposition method. This causes information leakage and significantly reduced the practical applicability of model engineering. Although rolling decomposition solves these issues, the prediction model shows poor performance and inefficiency in its utilisation of annual power load data. This study proposes a flexible VSTLF framework for a multivariable rolling decomposition hybrid learning paradigm to overcome these deficiencies. Specifically, a real-time rolling decomposition module based on annual power load features is utilised to adaptively denoise and strengthen the learnability of the sequences; this approach avoids using future information and improves data utilisation efficiency. Then, the main forecasting module, which integrates the long short-term memory network, attention mechanism, and ensemble learning optimised by the multiobjective dung beetle optimiser, performs point and interval predictions. Experimental results from two real-world power load datasets from China and Spain demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 2 % for point predictions and high-quality average interval scores for interval predictions. Performance evaluations demonstrated that the proposed optimiser can effectively obtain solutions along the Pareto frontier, outperforming traditional optimisation algorithms in terms of both convergence and diversity. This accurate and stable VSTLF system is expected to improve the efficiency of power grid planning and support effective energy management policies. © 2025","Xu, Aiting School of Statistics and Mathematics, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China","Xu, Aiting and Chen, Jiapeng and Li, Jinchang and Chen, Zheyu and Xu, Shenyi and Nie, Ying",10.1016/j.rser.2025.115375,UNKNOWN,13640321,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2025,False
Building a health systems science bridge between medical school and the clinical learning environment via a pilot faculty development cohort program,"Background: Clinical faculty development focused on Health Systems Science (HSS) is crucial for integrating HSS concepts into medical education. The 2021 HSSIP Faculty Development program was created to support faculty in effectively creating and incorporating comprehensive HSS content into the clerkship experience. Methods: Nine clinical champions, selected for their diverse backgrounds and interest in HSS, participated from November 2021 through October 2022 in monthly day-long, in-person workshops, and bi-monthly self-directed sessions, covering both HSS domains and foundational learning in curriculum development. Using a community of practice model, clinical champions gained expertise in HSS domains and developed curricula throughout the year-long program. Evaluation methods included surveys and feedback, focusing on satisfaction, self-efficacy, and curricular content creation. Results: Post-engagement surveys showed increased comfort in teaching HSS content, with significant improvement in specific areas. Participants valued learning from experts and collaborating with peers but found virtual sessions challenging. Despite systemic challenges and time constraints, clinical champions successfully created and implemented HSS-focused curricular content. They also contributed to broader HSS education efforts, presenting scholarly work and integrating HSS into various educational activities. Conclusions: This study showcases an innovative approach to preparing faculty to integrate HSS into clinical education. Key lessons included the value of subject matter experts, community engagement, and the challenges of virtual participation. Despite limitations such as low response numbers and context-specific results, the program demonstrated the potential for broad HSS integration. Further research with more participants and more rigorous data collection protocols is needed to more fully understand the generalizability of such an innovation. The initiative serves as a model for other academic health centers. © The Author(s) 2025.","Harendt, Sarah M.

Digital nudging model for learning management systems: Saudi Arabia perspective,"Decisions related to education are complex and have long-term consequences. For higher education students, most of these decisions are made when students are young and with little academic experience; these decisions can potentially influence students to postpone the completion of academic tasks or make unwise decisions. In this research, an e-nudging model is proposed for higher education in Saudi Arabia (SA), offering early and low-cost support for universities to encourage students to make better. A mixed-methods approach (an explanatory sequential design) was adopted, and two online surveys were designed to target academics and IT staff. The survey of academics and IT staff yielded two new factors: training and support for both instructors and students and awareness of e-nudges. The students' survey showed that 45.30% of university students are struggling to maintain attention and 29.66% have issues with memory. The interview phase was conducted with twenty-five expert academics who were invited to give their perceptions about the e-nudging model, and two new factors were generated, namely “define students' barriers: behavior, cognitive and environmental” and “ethics of e-nudge”. The position of the evaluation stage in the e-nudging model was changed to make the purpose and functionality of this stage clearer to the readers. In the future, this research can be re-conducted in other developing countries, especially the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries which share many common characteristics such as culture, religion, social mores, languages, and economic and financial systems. © 2025 The Author(s)","Alotaibi, Salihah Information Systems Department, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Riyadh, 11432, Saudi Arabia; Issa, Tomayess Faculty of Business and Law, Curtin University, Hayman Road, Bentley, 6102, WA, Australia; Abu-Salih, Bilal King Abdullah II School of Information Technology, The University of Jordan, Amman, 11942, Jordan; Aljaafari, Mohammed King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, 31982, Saudi Arabia; Almiani, Muder Department of Management Information System (MIS), Gulf University for Science and Technology, Kuwait City, Kuwait","Alotaibi, Salihah and Issa, Tomayess and Abu-Salih, Bilal and Aljaafari, Mohammed and Almiani, Muder",10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e42672,UNKNOWN,24058440,Heliyon,2025,False
Model-free reinforcement learning-based transient power control of vehicle fuel cell systems,"Transient power control of vehicle fuel cell systems is the basis for performing energy management strategies, which are critical to the control of fuel cell vehicles. Nevertheless, the nonlinearity and the time-varying property in the model of characteristics of fuel cell dynamics make transient power control challenging. This study employs a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to control transient power in fuel cells precisely. This approach combines the feedforward mechanism of prior knowledge with the feedback mechanism of critic–actor neural networks. It validates its effectiveness through a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell system and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. Experimental results from a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell system indicate that under rapidly changing load conditions, the proposed control strategy exhibits rapid dynamic response, precise steady-state tracking performance, and high robustness against unmodeled dynamics, effectively addressing complex dynamic response challenges. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Zhang, Yahui School of Mechanical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, 066004, China; Li, Ganxin State Key Laboratory of Crane Technology, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, 066004, China; Tian, Yang School of Vehicle and Energy, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, 066004, China; Wang, Zhong State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University, Changchun, 130025, China","Zhang, Yahui and Li, Ganxin and Tian, Yang and Wang, Zhong and Liu, Jinfa and Gao, Jinwu and Jiao, Xiaohong and Wen, Guilin",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125614,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False
Human robot interaction (HRI): An artificial cognitive autonomy approach to enhance Decision-Making,"This study explores the critical role of artificial cognitive autonomy in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), focusing on scenarios where quick and safe decisions are imperative. We investigate a progressive autonomy strategy supported by advanced artificial cognition techniques to improve decision-making in unforeseen situations and in the face of unknown conditions. We highlight the importance of these systems in performing essential safety functions through a three-dimensional approach: advanced perception for detailed environmental analysis; decision making based on robust algorithms for logical assessment of risk scenarios; and precise action and control to perform essential autonomous tasks. Additionally, we present a conceptual modeling that illustrates the progression of autonomy levels from total dependence to completely autonomous operation, highlighting the evolution of HRI systems through artificial cognitive autonomy. This article argues that decision-making optimization in HRI can be significantly improved through a detailed and incremental understanding of autonomy. By adopting enabling technologies, we enable autonomous agents to not only evolve within their environments, but also learn, understand and fulfill their responsibilities effectively. This theoretical approach promotes a systematic evolution of autonomy, as well as ensuring that robotic systems adapt and respond appropriately to the complex and dynamic demands of the environments in which they operate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Lima Junior, Walter Teixeira Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil","Lima Junior, Walter Teixeira and Welter, Rudinei André and Ferreira, Wellington Pacheco and Souza, Rodrigo Ferreira and Eduardo, Tiago",10.1016/j.cogsys.2025.101336,UNKNOWN,13890417,Cognitive Systems Research,2025,False
"A survey on graph neural networks for remaining useful life prediction: Methodologies, evaluation and future trends","Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a critical aspect of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), aimed at predicting the future state of a system to enable timely maintenance and prevent unexpected failures. While existing deep learning methods have shown promise, they often struggle to fully leverage the spatial information inherent in complex systems, limiting their effectiveness in RUL prediction. To address this challenge, recent research has explored the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model spatial information for more accurate RUL prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GNN techniques applied to RUL prediction, summarizing existing methods and offering guidance for future research. We first propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages of adapting GNNs to RUL prediction, systematically categorizing approaches into four key stages: graph construction, graph modeling, graph information processing, and graph readout. By organizing the field in this way, we highlight the unique challenges and considerations at each stage of the GNN pipeline. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation of various state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN methods, ensuring consistent experimental settings for fair comparisons. This rigorous analysis yields valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, serving as an experimental guide for researchers and practitioners working in this area. Finally, we identify and discuss several promising research directions that could further advance the field, emphasizing the potential for GNNs to revolutionize RUL prediction and enhance the effectiveness of PHM strategies.

Early warning of complex climate risk with integrated artificial intelligence,"As climate change accelerates, human societies face growing exposure to disasters and stress, highlighting the urgent need for effective early warning systems (EWS). These systems monitor, assess, and communicate risks to support resilience and sustainable development, but challenges remain in hazard forecasting, risk communication, and decision-making. This perspective explores the transformative potential of integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling. We highlight the role of AI in developing multi-hazard EWSs that integrate Meteorological and Geospatial foundation models (FMs) for impact prediction. A user-centric approach with intuitive interfaces and community feedback is emphasized to improve crisis management. To address climate risk complexity, we advocate for causal AI models to avoid spurious predictions and stress the need for responsible AI practices. We highlight the FATES (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Sustainability) principles as essential for equitable and trustworthy AI-based Early Warning Systems for all. We further advocate for decadal EWSs, leveraging climate ensembles and generative methods to enable long-term, spatially resolved forecasts for proactive climate adaptation. © The Author(s) 2025.","Reichstein, Markus Amazon Web Services, Seattle and Santa Clara, CA, United States; Benson, Vitus ELLIS Unit Jena, Jena, Germany; Blunk, Jan Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany; Camps-Valls, Gustau ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Creutzig, Felix University of Jena, Jena, Germany; Fearnley, Carina J.

Exploring the impact of robot interaction on learning engagement: a comparative study of two multi-modal robots,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using robots within educational environments due to their potential to augment student engagement and motivation. However, current research has not adequately addressed the effectiveness of these robots in facilitating inclusive learning for diverse student populations, particularly those with dyslexia. This study proposes an inclusive learning system developed on two multi-modal robots, Kebbi and Minibo, with interactive (i.e., movable hands) and straightforward features. The system integrates various interactive elements, such as animations, songs, dance, gestures, and touch, to enhance students’ learning engagement, interaction, and motivation and cater to their diverse needs. The study aims to examine the influence of different features from two unique multi-modal robots on the engagement levels of students with/without dyslexia and their needs when engaging with robot learning. Two research questions are posed: (1) What are the features of multi-modal robots that could effectively improve the learning engagements of students with/without dyslexia? (2) What are the needs of students with/without dyslexia when engaging with robot learning? To this end, a comparative study is conducted where 64 students participate in a five-day robot-led training program, while another 73 students receive traditional teacher-led training. Pre/post questionnaires are administered to evaluate students’ engagement levels, and semi-structured interviews are conducted to obtain additional insights. The findings reveal that students with dyslexia are better suited to the interactive and multi-modal features of Kebbi. In contrast, students without dyslexia may prefer the more straightforward features of Minibo, which can still effectively promote engagement and learning. Multi-modal robots can boost engagement and motivation in students with and without dyslexia through novelty and cognitive load management. Emotional connections and interactive elements, such as empathetic and customizable features, enhance engagement and improve learning outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.","Fung, Ka Yan Interdisciplinary Programs Office (Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (IIP)), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong; Fung, Kwong Chiu Institute of Special Needs and Inclusive Education, ISNIE, The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK), Hong Kong; Lui, Tze Leung Rick Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; Sin, Kuen Fung Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong; Lee, Lik Hang Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong","Fung, Ka Yan and Fung, Kwong Chiu and Lui, Tze Leung Rick and Sin, Kuen Fung and Lee, Lik Hang and Qu, Huamin and Song, Shenghui",10.1186/s40561-024-00362-1,UNKNOWN,21967091,Smart Learning Environments,2025,False
Blockchain and timely auction mechanism-based spectrum management,"The rapid development of 5G/B5G communication networks and the exponential growth of next-generation wireless devices require more advanced and dynamic spectrum management and control architecture. Dynamic spectrum management and control based on blockchain is efficient and robust, but the cost of traditional consensus mechanisms is too high. In this paper, we propose a new spectrum management and control architecture based on blockchain and deep reinforcement learning, which proposes a new energy-saving consensus mechanism called proof of hierarchy to encourage blockchain users to perform spectrum sensing and detect spectrum violations. Meanwhile, we propose a timely auction mechanism based on deep reinforcement learning for dynamic spectrum management, achieving secure, efficient, and dynamic allocation of spectrum resources. Through intelligent resource allocation and trusted transaction mechanism, efficient spectrum management is realized to improve spectrum utilization and alleviate the shortage of spectrum resources. The simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. We construct a spectrum management scenario and compare it with the traditional spectrum management method. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can allocate spectrum resources more efficiently and provide a better user experience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Zhang, Hongyi State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Shaanxi, Xi'an, 710071, China; Liu, Mingqian Department of Engineering, University of Durham, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; Chen, Yunfei School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, China","Zhang, Hongyi and Liu, Mingqian and Chen, Yunfei and Zhao, Nan",10.1016/j.future.2024.107703,UNKNOWN,0167739X,Future Generation Computer Systems,2025,False
Knowledge Visualization of Internet Usage Pattern to Improve Students’ Academic Performance Using Prescriptive Analytic,"The knowledge discovery from graphical graphs could be challenging. Most of the time, the visual analysis cannot be done solely based on naked eyes interpretation. Therefore, knowledge visualization is vital to assist the process, especially in business intelligence and analytics to improve data insights and cognitive abilities. To effectively facilitate knowledge discovery from visual graphs, different analytical techniques should be explored in analyzing and visualizing the datasets. This study proposes an intelligent system to discover hidden knowledge from educational data by using interactive visualization and prescriptive analytic techniques. It focuses on model processing, as well as the development of an intelligent system to improve students’ academic performance. The method adapted Design Research, comprising of four stages which are 1) problem definition, 2) suggestion, 3) development, and 4) evaluation. Additionally, three stages of data analytics were applied in the development stages, namely 1) descriptive-analytic on Internet usage pattern and students’ academic performance, 2) predictive analytic of students’ academic performance based on Internet usage pattern, and 3) prescriptive analytic to recommend the suitable action to improve students’ academic performance. All these techniques involve data visualization by using the Microsoft Power BI tool. This approach is tested using a real dataset from Higher Learning Institutions, collected from 2017 to 2019. As a result, this leads to the desired knowledge visualization that facilitates the decision-making related to student performance enhancement. Theoretically, this study contributes to enhance the visualization and interpretation of data by using cognitive and reasoning components in prescriptive analytic. Besides, the proposed model enables decision maker in educational domain to make meaningful decisions regarding Internet usage management. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AI-Assisted Gamification Platform for Smart City Food Waste Management,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) can streamline gamification strategies in smart cities by enabling dynamic adjustments to sustain engagement and encourage behavioral change. This work presents an AI-assisted gamification platform, which relies on two core components. The first is a gamification strategy (GS) that focuses on a single rewarded task, making it adaptable for policymakers and practical for adoption. The second is an integrated AI mechanism incorporating a machine learning (ML) model that automatically adjusts gamification rules using Internet of Things (IoT) data and user behavior analysis. These two components are interdependent: the AI mechanism depends on task singularity for transparency, adaptability, and user control, while the single-task GS depends on AI for practicality and long-term flexibility. The strategy centers on positive feedback for rewarding food-related businesses and their employees for adopting a food waste (FW) digestion system at the source, through an interactive platform. A controlled deployment confirmed the system’s feasibility and coherence, highlighting its potential for broader adoption in a unified smart city FW management application.

Patient- and public-driven health research: a model of coleadership and partnership in research priority setting using a modified James Lind Alliance approach,"Objectives: To describe the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Evidence Alliance's methodological approach to systematically identify 23 high priority health research topics (three in 2021 and 20 in 2023) from patient partners (including caregivers) and members of the public across Canada and beyond. Study Design and Setting: In 2021 and 2023, we collaborated with patient and public partners to co-design and co-conduct two priority setting initiatives. These initiatives involved a diverse group of patients, the public, clinicians, researchers, and health system decision-makers to systematically and collectively prioritize research topics based on their perceived importance and anticipated impact. We used a modified James Lind Alliance approach, where all participants were engaged as equal partners. The prioritization process consisted of the following steps: 1) identification and collection of research priorities from patients and the public; 2) summarizing the research priorities gathered; 3) conducting semistructured interviews (1-on-1 or focus groups depending on the number of submissions for each unique topic), conducting literature searches on each topic to identify relevant knowledge synthesis and appraising the quality of relevant evidence using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) checklist, and preparing lay summaries (1–2 pages) for each unique topic using a predefined template cocreated with patient partners; 4) conducting a priority setting exercise with a multidisciplinary panel consisting of an interim priority setting rating questionnaire to score each topic based on nine questions, followed by a virtual workshop to reach consensus on the final rating and ranking of topics; and 5) facilitating research by funding selected topics and providing capacity-building support to research teams. We conducted a formal process evaluation of engagement, transparency, information management, and considerations of values and context in 2023.

"Performance indicators on long-term care for older people in 43 high- and middle-income countries: literature review, web search and expert consultation","Background: Long-term care (LTC) for older people is an area of focus for many health and social policies in high- and middle-income countries. Performance Indicators are used to provide national and subnational jurisdictions with insights to ensure quality of the provided LTC services for older people. Although LTC systems vary across jurisdictions, there is demand for internationally comparable indicators to support countries in monitoring LTC and facilitate mutual learning. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of indicators currently employed to monitor the performance of LTC systems and services in high- and middle- income countries and describe their key characteristics. Methods: A review of the literature in six scientific databases (literature review) and web searches of relevant sites across 43 selected countries (web search) was conducted. We asked country representatives from the Working Party on Health Care Quality and Outcomes of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where most of these countries are represented, to cross-validate the sources of information found (expert consultation). We then extracted and analysed the data from all obtained sources based on a predetermined set of characteristics. Results: The search of scientific databases yielded 12,960 records, from which forty papers were selected for inclusion. The scientific literature findings were complemented by 34 grey literature sources. In total, we identified performance indicators being used to monitor LTC systems and services across 29 national and subnational jurisdictions in 24 out of 43 countries. In total, 620 indicators were identified. All jurisdictions used indicators related to institutional LTC and 16 also used indicators on home care. The most frequently monitored structures, processes, and results were pressure ulcers, falls, use of restraints and pain management. Conclusions: We identified LTC performance indicators currently being monitored in 29 jurisdictions across 24 countries. Many jurisdictions are monitoring similar structures, processes, and results. This presents an opportunity to develop internationally comparable LTC performance indicators based on existing efforts across countries. © The Author(s) 2025.","Poldrugovac, Mircha Department of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Wammes, Joost D.

Enhanced Channel Estimation Using Dilated Convolutional LSTM in CRN-IoT Systems,"Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) inside the Internet of Things (IoT) provide dynamic spectrum management, improving communication efficiency through the utilization of underutilized frequency segments. Current deep learning models for channel estimation in cognitive radio networks encounter issues including elevated computing complexity, sluggish adaptability to swiftly changing settings, and limitations in managing the varied characteristics of IoT devices. The Adaptive Skip-based Convolutional Deep-Skip Long Short-Term Memory (AdSk-based ConvD-SkipLSTM) model effectively resolves these challenges by delivering expedited and precise spectrum sensing and channel estimation, hence enhancing overall network performance. The identification of unused spectrum bands is conducted by the energy detection method. Subsequently, channel estimation is executed utilizing the proposed AdSk-based ConvD-SkipLSTM model. The suggested model improves the precision and efficacy of channel estimation, guaranteeing dependable communication. The proposed channel estimation model is evaluated using metrics such as normalized mean square error (NMSE), outage probability, and bit error rate (BER), demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional channel estimation techniques. The proposed method achieved a minimal BER of 1.62E-06 in comparison to current channel estimating techniques. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Danesh, K.

Integrating reinforcement learning and large language models for crop production process management optimization and control through a new knowledge-based deep learning paradigm,"Efficient and sustainable crop production process management is crucial to meet the growing global demand for food, fuel, and feed while minimizing environmental impacts. Traditional crop management practices, often developed through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms, their application within crop management, and the use of crop management simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Chen, Dong Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Mississippi State University, 39762, MS, United States; Huang, Yanbo United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service, Genetics and Sustainable Agriculture Research Unit, 39762, MS, United States","Chen, Dong and Huang, Yanbo",10.1016/j.compag.2025.110028,UNKNOWN,01681699,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,2025,False

Supporting Unhealthy Substance use care Through a whole person Approach and user centered INtegration into primary care (SUSTAIN): Study protocol for a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial,"Background: Unhealthy substance use (USU) is common and ranges from use above guideline-recommended levels to severe substance use disorder. USU results in substantial morbidity and mortality yet primary care practices rarely systematically screen, diagnose, and treat USU. Supporting Unhealthy Substance use care Through a whole person Approach and user centered INtegration into primary care (SUSTAIN) tests whether the implementation of a co-designed change package for USU improves patient function. The protocol for SUSTAIN is presented here. Methods: SUSTAIN is a cluster randomized controlled implementation trial of a customized approach to identify and treat USU in primary care. The sample includes 24 primary care clinics in two practice-based research networks (PBRNs). In phase one, primary care practice champions and patients with lived USU experience co-design a change package to identify and treat USU. In phase two, we test the effectiveness of the change package versus usual care and evaluate the implementation of the change package. Data will be collected from 24 clinics (50 patients per clinic for total of 1200 patients) through patient surveys and the electronic health record. Patients surveyed must be 18 or older and screen positive for USU using the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication and other Substance use part one (TAPS-1) tool. Primary outcomes include mental and physical health patient function scales measured using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29-v2). Secondary outcomes are prevalence of USU, recovery, health care utilization, USU screening rates, provision/referral to behavioral health services and prescription of appropriate medications. We will also evaluate implementation outcomes by surveying 96 practice representatives (4 at each clinic) and conduct qualitative interviews with 20 patients and 20 practice leaders to assess their experience with the intervention and its implementation. Conclusions: The SUSTAIN trial creates and tests an implementation package approach to address USU in diverse primary care settings. The SUSTAIN change package aims to transform how primary care practices care for individuals with USU to improve patient outcomes and enhance community well-being. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","Simon, Claire B.

Estimate state of charge in lithium-ion batteries with unknown data,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital for sustainable energy solutions, with the state of charge (SOC) serving as a critical indicator of their energy levels, directly influencing safety and efficiency. However, accurately estimating SOC remains challenging due to complex internal chemical processes and factors such as unknown data distribution, error accumulation, delayed feedback, and sensitivity to input data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a physics-guided meta-learning framework for cross-task adaptation in SOC estimation. During the model adaptation phase, the challenge of acquiring the maximum capacity prevented the calculation of the SOC at the beginning of the discharge process, which is critical for adaptation or fine-tuning. This framework adapts quickly to new data distributions with the most similarly distributed data and learns adaptive strategies, enabling rapid model updates across various attributes, such as LIB types, temperatures, and operating conditions. Moreover, to further enhance the accuracy and generalization performance of the model, the Coulomb counting method is integrated into the network training process. The physical parameters utilized in Coulomb counting are provided and refined by the neural network, which also generates a separate estimate. Additionally, physical constraints are added to the loss function to guide the update of network parameters. This approach combines physical guidance with the estimation of neural network, thereby partially mitigating the errors inherent in the training process with similar data. We evaluated the estimation model through five-fold cross-validation on 56 datasets. The framework demonstrates strong generalization, achieving robust SOC estimation across varying capacities and conditions. Our work highlights the potential of meta-learning for fast adaptation in SOC estimation under unknown distributions and demonstrates the importance of physical information guidance in improving robustness and performance. This framework can be applied to a wide range of batteries, providing robust support for battery management systems (BMS). © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Hu, Jingwei School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Li, Xiaodong Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials (iChEM), State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Fang, Zheng Kehua Data Co., Ltd., Xiamen, China","Hu, Jingwei and Li, Xiaodong and Fang, Zheng and Cheng, Jun and Yi, Longqiang and Zhang, Zhihong",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125736,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False
Multimodal deep ensemble classification system with wearable vibration sensor for detecting throat-related events,"Dysphagia, a swallowing disorder, requires continuous monitoring of throat-related events to obtain comprehensive insights into the patient’s pharyngeal and laryngeal functions. However, conventional assessments were performed by medical professionals in clinical settings, limiting persistent monitoring. We demonstrate feasibility of a ubiquitous monitoring system for autonomously detecting throat-related events utilizing a soft skin-attachable throat vibration sensor (STVS). The STVS accurately records throat vibrations without interference from surrounding noise, enabling measurement of subtle sounds such as swallowing. Out of the continuous data stream, we automatically classify events of interest using an ensemble-based deep learning model. The proposed model integrates multiple deep neural networks based on multi-modal acoustic features of throat-related events to enhance robustness and accuracy of classification. The performance of our model outperforms previous studies with a classification accuracy of 95.96%. These results show the potential of wearable solutions for improving dysphagia management and patient outcomes outside of clinical environments. © The Author(s) 2025.","Song, Yonghun Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea; Yun, Inyeol Future IT Innovation Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea; Giovanoli, Sandra Data Analytics & Rehabilitation Technology (DART), Lake Lucerne Institute (LLUI) & cereneo Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CEFIR), Vitznau, Switzerland; Easthope, Chris Awai Department of Semiconductor Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea; Chung, Yoonyoung Center for Semiconductor Technology Convergence, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea","Song, Yonghun and Yun, Inyeol and Giovanoli, Sandra and Easthope, Chris Awai and Chung, Yoonyoung",10.1038/s41746-024-01417-w,UNKNOWN,23986352,npj Digital Medicine,2025,False
Deep learning-based classification of dementia using image representation of subcortical signals,"Background: Dementia is a neurological syndrome marked by cognitive decline. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia cases (AD and FTD) is crucial for effective medical care, as both conditions have similar early-symptoms. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing EEG derived scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique are utilized. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to validate the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (128 channels, comprising 16 AD, 13 FTD, and 19 healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (64 channels, including subjects with 10 AD, 9 MCI, and 8 HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes in both data sets. Results: The best results were achieved using a product of probabilities from classifiers for left and right subcortical regions in conjunction with the DenseNet model architecture. It yield accuracies of 94.17% and 77.72% on the BrainLat and IITD-AIIA datasets, respectively. Conclusions: The results highlight that the image representation-based deep learning approach has the potential to differentiate various stages of dementia.

Adaptive manufacturing control with Deep Reinforcement Learning for dynamic WIP management in industry 4.0,"In the context of Industry 4.0, manufacturing systems face increased complexity and uncertainty due to elevated product customisation and demand variability. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive Work-In-Progress (WIP) control in semi-heterarchical architectures, addressing the limitations of traditional analytical methods that rely on exponential processing time distributions. Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) enables model-free control of flow-shop production systems under non-exponential, stochastic processing times. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent dynamically manages WIP levels in a CONstant Work In Progress (CONWIP) environment, learning optimal control policies directly from system interactions. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments with varying machine numbers, processing times, and system variability. The results show robust performance in tracking the target throughput and adapting the processing time variability, achieving Mean Absolute Percentual Errors (MAPE) in the throughput – calculated as the percentage difference between the actual and the target throughput – ranging from 0.3% to 2.3% with standard deviations of 5. 5% to 8. 4%. Key contributions include the development of a data-driven WIP control approach to overcome analytical methods’ limitations in stochastic environments, validating DQN agent adaptability across varying production scenarios, and demonstrating framework scalability in realistic manufacturing settings.

Comparative analysis of correlation and causality inference in water quality problems with emphasis on TDS Karkheh River in Iran,"Water quality management is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran where water scarcity is compounded by quality degradation. This study delves into the causal relationships influencing water quality, focusing on Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) as a primary indicator in the Karkheh River, southwest Iran. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning 50 years (1968–2018), this research integrates Machine Learning (ML) techniques to examine correlations and infer causality among multiple parameters, including flow rate (Q), Sodium (Na+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Calcium (Ca2+), Chloride (Cl−), Sulfate (SO42−), Bicarbonates (HCO3−), and pH. For modeling the causation, the “Back door linear regression” approach has been considered which establishes a stable and interpretable framework in causal inference by focusing on clear assumptions. Predictive modeling was used to show the difference between correlation and causation along with interpretability modeling to make the predictive model transparent. Predictive modeling does not report the causality among the variables as it showed Mg is not contributing to the target (TDS) while the findings reveal that TDS is predominantly positive influenced by Mg, Na, Cl, Ca and SO4, with HCO3 and pH exerting negative (inverse) effects. Unlike correlations, causal relationships demonstrate directional and often unequal influences, highlighting Mg as a critical driver of TDS levels. This novel application of ML-based causal inference in water quality research provides a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional experimental methods. The results underscore the potential of ML-driven causal analysis to guide water resource management and policy-making. By identifying the key drivers of TDS, this study proposes targeted interventions to mitigate water quality deterioration. Moreover, the insights gained lay the foundation for developing early warning systems, ensuring proactive and sustainable water quality management in similar hydrological contexts. © The Author(s) 2025.","Shakeri, Reza School of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran; Amini, Hossein School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom; Fakheri, Farshid Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran","Shakeri, Reza and Amini, Hossein and Fakheri, Farshid and Lam, Man Yue and Zahraie, Banafsheh",10.1038/s41598-025-85908-0,UNKNOWN,20452322,Scientific Reports,2025,False

A Reliable Model for Predicting Methane Solubility in Brine: Toward Effective Methane Emission Mitigation,"Methane solubility in brine is a critical parameter in various natural and industrial processes, including gas production, storage, chemical engineering, and environmental studies. This study develops and validates explicit predictive correlations for methane solubility in brine using two robust white-box machine learning techniques, including the multigene genetic programming (MGGP) and the group method of data handling (GMDH). A comprehensive database of 684 experimental data points, covering extensive operational conditions of pressure (0.433-140 MPa), temperature (273.15-493.15 K), and NaCl molality (0-5.4 mol/kg), was employed to train and test the proposed correlations. The accuracy of the correlations was assessed using statistical metrics, error distribution analyses, and graphical techniques. Results revealed that both correlations yielded excellent predictive accuracy, with the MGGP-based scheme consistently outperforming the GMDH model by achieving a lower total RMSE value of 0.000243. Furthermore, the trend analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method demonstrated that the MGGP-based correlation successfully captured the physical trends of methane solubility in methane with respect to the input features. Additionally, a comparison with some prior paradigms showed the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of the MGGP-based correlation. Lastly, the applicability domain of the MGGP-based correlation was defined using the Leverage approach, confirming its robustness, with 98.538% of the data points falling within the trust region. The explicit nature of the MGGP-based correlation allows for its integration into environmental management and sustainability frameworks, facilitating improved assessments of methane behavior in natural systems. This integration enables the development of more efficient and effective strategies for methane emission mitigation and climate change mitigation efforts. Furthermore, these models enhance sustainability by supporting the design of environmentally responsible industrial operations.

This research comprehensively reviews the existing literature on traditional and AI-based IAQ management, focusing on privacy-preserving techniques. The analysis reveals that while significant progress has been made in IAQ monitoring, most systems prioritize accuracy at the expense of privacy. Existing approaches often fail to adequately address the risks associated with data collection and the implications for occupant privacy. Emerging AI-driven technologies, such as federated learning and edge computing, offer promising solutions by processing data locally and minimizing privacy risks. This research introduces a novel AI-based IAQ management platform incorporating the SITA (Spatial, Identity, Temporal, and Activity) model. By leveraging customizable privacy settings, the platform enables users to safeguard sensitive information while ensuring effective IAQ management. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, edge computing, and advanced privacy-preserving technologies, the proposed system delivers a robust and scalable solution that protects both privacy and health. © 2025 The Authors","Quang, Tran Van Department of Architectural Engineering, Kyung Hee University, 1732, Deogyeong-daero, Giheung-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Yongin-si, 17104, South Korea; Doan, Dat Tien Department of Built Environment Engineering, School of Future Environments, Auckland University of Technology, 55 Wellesley Street East, Auckland Central, Auckland, 1010, New Zealand; Ngarambe, Jack School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, 123000, China","Quang, Tran Van and Doan, Dat Tien and Ngarambe, Jack and Ghaffarianhoseini, Ali and Ghaffarianhoseini, Amirhosein and Zhang, Tongrui",10.1016/j.jobe.2024.111712,UNKNOWN,23527102,Journal of Building Engineering,2025,False
"Efficient cooling capability in microchannel heat sink reinforced with Y-shaped fins: Based on artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, Pareto front, and numerical simulation","Microchannel heat sinks play a vital role in modern technology due to the increasing demand for efficient thermal management in compact electronic devices. These systems enhance heat dissipation and maintain optimal operating temperatures, yet conventional heat sinks often fail to meet the stringent cooling demands of modern technologies. To address this, a novel microchannel heat sink reinforced with Y-shaped fins was introduced as an advanced cooling solution. Unlike traditional straight fins, Y-shaped fins improve flow distribution, reduce hot spots, and enhance temperature uniformity across the system's surface. Artificial neural network models were developed to evaluate the impact of fin geometry on performance. Key geometric parameters, including fin attack angle, vertical spacing, and horizontal spacing, were used as input variables, while the Nusselt number and pressure drop were selected as performance outputs. The results revealed that the fin attack angle was the most influential parameter affecting the outputs. The applied cost functions demonstrated the high accuracy of the models in predicting system performance. A genetic algorithm was employed for single-objective optimization targeting three criteria: maximizing total efficiency, minimizing pressure drop, and maximizing the Nusselt number. Two optimized designs were proposed. Design 1 (with an attack angle of 60°, vertical spacing of 120 μm, and horizontal spacing of 400 μm) was optimal for maximizing total efficiency and minimizing the pressure drop. This design achieved a 69.26 % increase in the Nusselt number and a 42.9 % improvement in total efficiency compared to the finless design. Design 2 (with an attack angle of 120°, vertical spacing of 175.650 μm, and horizontal spacing of 200 μm) focused on only maximizing heat transfer, resulting in a 109.28 % increase in the Nusselt number and a 27.1 % improvement in total efficiency. A multi-objective optimization process was conducted in response to the need to balance these multiple objectives. The TOPSIS analysis and Pareto fronts for the Nusselt number and pressure drop were generated to provide a comprehensive framework for designing an efficient and practical microchannel heat sink. © 2025 The Authors","Ma, Xiang Xijing University, Shaanxi, Xi'an, 710123, China; Basem, Ali Faculty of Engineering, Warith Al-Anbiyaa University, Karbala, 56001, Iraq; Singh, Pradeep Kumar Department of Mechanical Engineering, Institute of Engineering & Technology, GLA University, U.P., Mathura, 281406, India; Dara, Rebwar Nasir Department of Earth Sciences and Petroleum, College of Science, Salahaddin University-Erbil, Erbil, 44001, Iraq; Almadhor, Ahmad Department of Petroleum Engineering, College of Engineering, Knowledge University, Erbil, 44001, Iraq; Hajri, Amira K.

Decoding effort: Toward a measure – and a new understanding – of effort intensity in accounting research,"This study introduces pupillometry – the measurement of pupil diameter changes – as a direct approach to capturing effort intensity in management accounting research. Traditional approaches using self-reports or performance-based proxies have limited researchers’ ability to study how management control systems influence behavior through effort. Using a controlled experiment with a decoding task, we examine how piece-rate versus flat-wage compensation influences effort intensity and performance. Our findings show that pupil dilation partially mediates the relationship between incentives and performance, with this mediation strongest in early experimental rounds before weakening over time. This dynamic pattern suggests that while incentives initially influence performance through effort intensity, other mechanisms such as implicit learning emerge in later rounds. Beyond demonstrating pupillometry's validity for measuring effort intensity, we highlight its potential applications across management accounting research streams, enabling researchers to better understand how control system elements influence behavior through effort. © 2025 The Authors","Hecht, Gary University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States; Rotaru, Kristian Monash University, Australia; Schulz, Axel K.-D.

Adaptive trajectory tracking of the unmanned surface vessel based on improved AC-MPC method,"Trajectory tracking is one of the key technologies for ensuring safe navigation of the unmanned surface vessel (USV), whose main challenges are the low control accuracy and uncertainties caused by environmental disturbances. In this study, an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed based on the Actor-Critic (AC) reinforcement learning strategy. First, a traditional MPC method is used for USV trajectory tracking. Then, the AC strategy is integrated to continuously adjust the state weight coefficients in the model predictive controller to address the increased error problem resulting from suboptimal control parameters. Finally, the prediction step size in the MPC is adaptively improved based on changes in reinforcement learning reward values and the selection of state-weight parameters. Simulation results show that the AC-MPC method adjusts the state-weight parameters quickly, and selects the appropriate prediction step size according to the change of the reward value. The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of parameter adjustment when using the model predictive controller for trajectory tracking, thereby enhancing the adaptability of the controller in performing trajectory tracking tasks across various environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Zhang, Lei School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Energy Power Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Zhang, Shengzhuo School of Navigation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Du, Zhe Hubei Key Laboratory of Inland Shipping Technology, Wuhan, China; Li, Hui Key Laboratory of High Performance Ship Technology (Wuhan University of Technology), Ministry of Education, Wuhan, China; Gan, Langxiong The Development and Research Center of Changjiang River Shipping, China; Li, Xiaobin State Key Laboratory of Maritime Technology and Safety, China","Zhang, Lei and Zhang, Shengzhuo and Du, Zhe and Li, Hui and Gan, Langxiong and Li, Xiaobin",10.1016/j.oceaneng.2025.120455,UNKNOWN,00298018,Ocean Engineering,2025,False
A two-stage multi-task learning model for predicting and interpreting received answers in online mental health communities,"Online mental health communities (OMHCs) have emerged as a vital platform for individuals with mental health issues to seek supports through questioning. However, there is a scarcity of research focusing on improving the quality of help-seekers’ questions. Furthermore, previous methods have overlooked the complexity of answerers’ decision-making process when answering to questions. To this end, we propose a Two-stage Multi-task Learning Approach (TsMLA) that predicts and interprets received answers for the given question. Our model considers interactions between different views of information by introducing early and late fusion mechanisms to capture memory activation between titles and descriptions. Then, we incorporate the number of answers over a specific period as an auxiliary task to enhance predictive performance. More importantly, motivated by answerers’ decision-making behavior, we design a two-stage approach to consider interactions between different pieces of features. Our experiments demonstrate that TsMLA significantly outperforms several benchmark methods and obtains better performance. Case studies demonstrate the interpretability of our model. Our results have critical implications for health information system to design computational artifacts. Furthermore, our proposed model contributes to management of OMHCs and help-seekers’ experience. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Yin, Qiuju School of Management, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China","Yin, Qiuju and Yang, Liang and Kuang, Junwei and Yan, Zhijun",10.1016/j.eswa.2025.126583,UNKNOWN,09574174,Expert Systems with Applications,2025,False
Dynamics of self-regulated learning: The effectiveness of students’ strategies across course periods,"Proper self-regulating skills are essential in the new reality of digital learning in higher education. Research has shown that the trace data of students’ learning management system activity can identify various online learning tactics and strategies, but also their transitional dynamics, which are linked to academic performance. This study builds on this work by examining how learning tactics and strategies change within individual courses and how this relates to academic performance. A substantial dataset of 41 courses over two academic years at one university is analyzed. Employing Markov models on trace data, we identify prevalent tactics and strategies students use throughout courses. Our study examines shifts in strategy usage, comparing patterns between the initial and latter stages of the courses. The results reveal distinct clusters of learning strategies and their impact on academic achievement. Notably, deep learning strategies show significantly superior performance to surface approaches, especially when maintained over time. Moreover, students who consistently apply the same strategy score higher than those who are inconsistent. However, consistent surface learners score significantly lower than inconsistent learners. Underscoring such longitudinal trends could help interventions, aiding educators in targeting students with weaker strategies at specific times to boost their effectiveness and efficiency. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of self-regulated learning behaviors in online educational contexts by showing the importance of dynamic transition of learning strategies for educators, instructional designers, and policymakers to enhance student learning experiences and outcomes. © 2025","Cristea, T.S.

A systemic approach to identifying sustainable community-based interventions for improving adolescent mental health: a participatory group model building and design protocol,"Background: The deteriorating mental health of children and young people in the United Kingdom poses a challenge that services and policy makers have found difficult to tackle. Kailo responds to this issue with a community-based participatory and systemically informed strategy, perceiving mental health and well-being as a dynamic state shaped by the interplay of broader health determinants. The initiative works to explore, define and implement locally relevant solutions to challenges shaping the mental health and well-being of young people. Kailo unfolds in three stages within each locale. These stages encompass: “early discovery”, “deeper discovery and co-design” and “implementation”. This document delves into the participatory group model building and design protocol occurring in the “deeper discovery and co-design” stage of the project. Methods: Participatory methods, such as group model building, are effective in articulating and building consensus on complex issues like the social determinants of adolescent mental health. This paper describes the protocol for application of group model building within the Kailo design process to develop causal loop diagrams and pinpoint leverage points for improving adolescent mental health. It also suggests a method for considering modifications to delivery within a unique project context and in alignment with participants’ needs. This paper sets out to define the approach and clarify the objectives these engagements aim to fulfil. The method adapts existing group model building (GMB) protocols for use in a community setting. The engagements will involve groups of local young people and existing community members. To assess the success of the session’s implementation post-delivery, the study utilizes existing frameworks for fidelity evaluations, which define a core and flex model. Discussion: The method described enables an integration of diverse local understandings of complex processes which provides a platform for creating co-designed interventions. This protocol can be used to further strengthen research and design through incorporating complexity and participation into the formulation of contextually relevant policies and practices. The strengths and limitations of the approach are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024.","Keenan, Megan Dartington Service Design Lab, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Freeman, Leanne Dartington Service Design Lab, Buckfastleigh, United Kingdom; Santana de Lima, Ediane Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, United States; Potter, Katie University College London, London, United Kingdom","Keenan, Megan and Freeman, Leanne and Santana de Lima, Ediane and Potter, Katie and Hobbs, Tim and Ballard, Ellis and Fonagy, Peter",10.1186/s12961-024-01247-y,UNKNOWN,14784505,Health Research Policy and Systems,2025,False

Learnings from Implementation Strategies to Improve Lipid Management,"Purpose of Review: Lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduces cardiovascular risk. International lipid management guidelines recommend LDL-cholesterol goals or thresholds for initiating lipid-lowering therapy. However, contemporary real-world studies have shown that many high- and very high-risk patients are not attaining LDL-cholesterol goals and are not receiving intensive lipid-lowering therapies. In this review, recent examples of implementation strategies for optimising lipid management are discussed. Recent Findings: Implementation studies are heterogenous in their strategies and design. At the clinician level, multidisciplinary team-based care (including multidisciplinary lipid clinics), pharmacist- or nurse-led interventions, decision-support algorithms or protocols, and educational initiatives have shown potential to improve lipid management. Various strategies to improve patient adherence to lipid-lowering therapies have demonstrated at least short-term efficacy, including education, shared decision-making, behavioural support and nudges. Electronic health records can be leveraged at low cost to identify patients requiring initiation or intensification of lipid-lowering therapies, but the optimal method of integrating automated alerts or nudges to influence decision-making requires further research. Moreover, telehealth and remote care delivery models can improve access to healthcare and facilitate lipid-lowering. Summary: Multifaceted strategies with a systematic approach to targeting clinician, patient and system related factors can be successful in improving lipid management. Future implementation research should evaluate longer-term outcomes and follow implementation science theories, models and/or frameworks at all stages. By doing so, ongoing implementation studies will help researchers better understand the impact, sustainability and scalability of strategies, and where barriers and facilitators to lipid management may exist in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2025.","Lan, Nick S.

"Development, implementation, and evaluation of an innovative clinical trial operations training program for Africa (ClinOps)","Background: Africa’s involvement in clinical trials remains very low. Although the crucial role of training initiatives in building clinical trial capacity in Africa has been documented, current efforts fall short as they lack alignment with local contexts. This study aimed to design, develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative clinical trial operations training program for Africa. Methods: We developed ClinOps, a novel 10-week clinical trial operations training program for study coordinators in Africa to enhance their expertise in four fundamental areas: designing, conducting, managing, and reporting clinical trials. To streamline the learning process, we used cloud-based applications that minimize the need for software installations while maximizing student engagement. VoiceThread facilitated interactive content that could be accessed offline. Moodle, an open-source learning management system, offered a platform for sharing learning tools, mentorship, and rubric-driven competency assessments, including quizzes, forums, tutorials, and group assignments. We utilized Zoom for live tutorials and mentoring as required. Effectiveness of the program was evaluated through quantitative pre- and post-surveys, qualitative end-course evaluations, and a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework. The pre- and post-surveys measured changes in trainees’ confidence in clinical trial domains and leadership and coordination skills. End-course evaluations gathered feedback on the course content, organization, technology, and instructional methods. We used Wilcoxon rank test to analyze pre- and post-survey scores and thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data. Results: In the initial cohort, 88 study coordinators from 19 countries participated, including 56 (64%) females, with 57 (65%) actively employed as study coordinators during the training, and 85 (97%) possessing prior experience in clinical trial roles.

Soft-switching predictive Type-3 fuzzy control for microgrid energy management,"Because each mode has distinct optimization requirements, optimizing the economic performance of microgrids (MGs) in grid-connected and islanded modes presents unique issues. This research offers a novel methodology to overcome this difficulty and better use renewable resources while satisfying the growing needs of the energy market. To maximize the MG’s performance, this approach combines fuzzy control, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with soft switching technologies. Two predictive rules are used in the design of the control system to handle the particular requirements of either the grid-connected or islanded mode depending on the MG’s operational condition. The study’s findings demonstrate that, in addition to lowering energy expenses in large commercial buildings, the suggested strategy optimizes the use of renewable energy sources and storage capacity in a range of network scenarios.

Physics-informed machine learning estimation of the temperature of large-format lithium-ion batteries under various operating conditions,"The thermal issues of lithium-ion batteries significantly affect their performance, safety, and lifespan, and are one of the main obstacles hindering the further development of electric vehicles. Accurate tracking and prediction of the temperature distribution of lithium-ion batteries provide feedback for the Battery Management System, which is crucial for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the battery system. At present, temperature estimation methods for battery systems mostly rely on physical models with numerous parameters, which fail to reflect the overall temperature distribution of large-format batteries. On the other hand, data-driven models for battery temperature require large amounts of training data and are prone to overfitting and other problems. These models lead to problems such as low accuracy in temperature estimation for battery systems, a high demand for training data, and poor model interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network model based on the thermal physical model of large-format batteries. By embedding the thermal-physical model information of the battery into the neural network, the model can accurately predict the evolution of the lithium-ion batteries temperature under various operating conditions. Experimental results show that under different constant current and dynamic conditions, the maximum Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error of the Physics-Informed Neural Network model do not exceed 0.6 °C. Compared with traditional methods, this approach significantly enhances the precision and interpretability of the model with smaller datasets, providing a more accurate basis for temperature distribution in battery management system. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Shen, Kai School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China; Xu, Wendong State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China","Shen, Kai and Xu, Wendong and Lai, Xin and Li, Dawei and Meng, Xiangqi and Zheng, Yuejiu and Feng, Xuning",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2025.126200,UNKNOWN,13594311,Applied Thermal Engineering,2025,False
Enhancing PV power forecasting accuracy through nonlinear weather correction based on multi-task learning,"Accurate short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for optimizing energy management and maintaining grid stability within the rapidly growing renewable energy sector. However, the inherent high sensitivity of PV systems to varying weather conditions poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. Existing research endeavours to enhance short-term forecasting accuracy through two primary approaches. On the one hand, some studies incorporate weather variables as input features to improve prediction precision, yet this method often falls short of fully capturing the intricate and dynamic interactions between diverse weather factors and PV output. On the other hand, most correction methods utilize error correction (EC) techniques that adjust initial PV forecasts based on predicted errors. Nonetheless, the highly volatile nature of error sequences substantially restricts the effectiveness of EC, as these unpredictable errors compromise the reliability of the corrective adjustments. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage framework that leverages weather information from multiple perspectives to enhance short-term PV power forecasting accuracy. In the first stage, a customized multi-task learning (MTL) framework employs a task interaction matrix to differentiate between task-specific and shared features, thereby facilitating meaningful interactions between PV output and weather variables while providing interpretability. Additionally, a dynamic loss weighting mechanism ensures balanced training across tasks. In the second stage, we implement a nonlinear weather correction (WC) module using neural networks, which refines the initial PV predictions by effectively incorporating the predicted weather variables, thereby enhancing both accuracy and robustness. Experimental validation using real PV data from the Northern Territory, Australia, demonstrates that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models across various seasons and confirms the effectiveness of each component within the framework through ablative experiments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Tian, Zhirui School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Chen, Yujie School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, Dalian, Liaoning, China; Wang, Guangyu School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, Dalian, Liaoning, China","Tian, Zhirui and Chen, Yujie and Wang, Guangyu",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125525,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False
Intelligent wearable system design for personalized knee motion and swelling monitoring in osteoarthritis care,"Daily knee monitoring is critical for osteoarthritis management, aiding in both prevention and rehabilitation. Current wearable solutions for daily use typically capture knee-bending angles as a single feature but lack evidence for comprehensive knee-state recognition. Here we introduce SyncKnee, a knee-monitoring system that tracks both joint angles and swelling patterns, providing detailed knee-state monitoring for daily use. SyncKnee consists of three components: a stretch sensor pad, a multi-modal machine-learning model, and personalized information support. The sensor, made from poly(SBS) fiber and eutectic gallium-indium alloy, tracks skin deformation from bending and swelling. Robotic-arm-driven tests confirm sensor accuracy in responding to bending and swelling.

A Stackelberg-based deep reinforcement learning approach for dynamic cooperative advertising in a two-echelon supply chain,"Dynamic market design through cooperative advertising programs is conducive to generating immediate sales as well as win-win or Pareto-efficient yields. However, in a decentralized supply chain, there is no known optimal advertising and ordering policy for different participants. Motivated by this, we integrate inventory control with the expectation-based reference price in a two-player supply chain where a manufacturer provides a cooperative advertising program for a retailer. After eliciting the problem as an infinite-horizon Stackelberg game, we propose a novel Leader-Follower Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LFDDPG) algorithm.

Implementation of prehospital point-of-care ultrasound using a novel continuous feedback approach in a UK helicopter emergency medical service,"Background: There has been increased use of prehospital point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) in recent years. Lack of governance structure and evidence of benefit have been described as major barriers to its implementation. This paper describes a novel approach to implementation of prehospital PoCUS and clinical governance framework in a UK HEMS. Methods: A retrospective database review was undertaken at London’s Air Ambulance (LAA) from 1st September 2021 to 31st March 2023. All patients who had PoCUS examination were included. Scans were archived in a cloud-based server and reviewed weekly by expert clinicians. They were graded in adequacy, agreement between reviewer and clinician was recorded and fed back to the clinicians allowing continuous feedback learning. In-hospital diagnosis was sought for patients having the full Pump, Pleura and Pouring blood (PPPB) protocol. Cohen’s Kappa (ƙ) was calculated for inter-rater reliability. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was performed using 2 × 2 tables. Results: LAA attended 3,068 missions. Our reviewers identified 701 PoCUS scanning encounters and 628 were included in the final analysis. Clinicians performed 420 scans for pneumothorax, 308 for free fluid and 305 pericardial effusions respectively. Majority of the population were male (85%) who sustained traumatic (93.5%) thoracic injuries (65%). Paramedics performed 29% of the scans. Reviewers deemed 83% of the scans of adequate quality. Inter-rater reliability between clinicians and reviewers was 0.6 for pericardial effusion, 0.67 for pneumothorax and 0.71 for free fluid respectively. A full PPPB protocol was performed in 52 patients out of which 46 were included. The sensitivity and specificity of PPPB protocol for diagnosis life-threatening injuries was 0.5 and 0.9 respectively. Conclusion: Introduction of prehospital PoCUS in a HEM service utilizing high quality training, user-friendly workflow and image archiving system, robust governance framework and continuous feedback may be feasible allowing high quality ultrasound examinations. The bespoke PPPB protocol in prehospital may improve diagnosis of life-threatening injuries. © The Author(s) 2025.","Naeem, Salman London’s Air Ambulance Charity, Royal London Hospital, London, United Kingdom; Aziz, Shadman Department of emergency medicine, William Harvey Hospital, East Kent Hospitals University Foundation Trust, Ashford, United Kingdom; Hirst, Thomas Department of Research, Audit, Innovation, and Development, East Anglian Air Ambulance, Norwich, United Kingdom; Strobel, Johannes Department of emergency medicine, Queen’s Hospital Romford, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Barking, Romford, United Kingdom; Mulvey, Jamin M.

A framework to guide future farming research with Indigenous communities,"We present a framework to guide applied research with Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous cropping systems are relevant to scientifically addressing many of the shortcomings and problems regarding current cropping systems. Indigenous food sovereignty movements are currently preserving and expanding their cropping system food ways. The knowledge underlying these efforts is not static but dynamic, incorporating contemporary tools in ever changing environments. We highlight four principles of Indigenous farming that are reflected in both practice and cultural traditions: polycultures, seed-keeping, sustainability, and community. These principles have been pivotal to the primary author’s doctoral research as they collaborate with Indigenous communities in Wisconsin to trial organic farming practices that utilize their traditional values and knowledge. We encourage more applied research in farming and natural sciences that uphold Indigenous ways of knowing as equal to Western science through collaborating with Indigenous Peoples. Researchers should be aware of the implications of research in Indigenous communities, involving the cultural boundaries associated with crops and seeds, which are often not regulated and thus warrant protection. As Western science seeks to find sustainable alternatives to current farming norms, as seen in other areas of land management, we encourage creating shared learning environments between researchers and Indigenous Peoples to foster relevant and equitable outcomes for farming practices. © 2025 by the Authors.","Hayden, Daniel Department of Plant Pathology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1630 Linden Drive RM 383, Madison, 53706, WI, United States; Hayden, Amber Arizona State University, United States","Hayden, Daniel and Hayden, Amber",10.5304/jafscd.2025.141.022,UNKNOWN,21520801,"Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development",2025,False
"Data's big three: How learning health systems, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics are transforming healthcare","Pharmacotherapies are common therapeutic interventions in patient care. Despite most medications being self-managed by patients at home, little attention has been paid to medication risks in the outpatient medication management process. As community pharmacies dispense medicines to outpatients, they are well-positioned to decrease preventable harm by implementing systemic medication risk management practices. This article is a mid-term review of a national development programme to enhance community pharmacies’ involvement in outpatient medication risk management in Finland (Valo programme 2021–2026). The article comprises the programme description utilising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's framework, and the programme's preliminary mid-term results. Through the programme: 1) the same patient safety incident reporting and learning system used by most Finnish health- and social care (HSC) organisations was implemented in community pharmacies, 2) medication safety culture was promoted by enhancing community pharmacists’ competencies in medication safety, 3) regional collaboration between community pharmacies and HSC organisations was supported through networks, and 4) a national research strategy was created to support outpatient medication safety research. Involving community pharmacies in outpatient medication risk management supports HSC systems. This article introduces nationwide actions that could be utilised in other countries to enhance community pharmacies’ involvement. © 2025","Butler-Henderson, Kerryn Digital Health, School of Nursing, Paramedicine and Healthcare Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia","Butler-Henderson, Kerryn and Arabi, Salma and Wang, Wei",10.1136/bmjhci-2024-101414,UNKNOWN,26321009,BMJ Health and Care Informatics,2025,False
Fog Service Placement Optimization: A Survey of State-of-the-Art Strategies and Techniques,"The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various smart city-based applications such as healthcare, traffic management systems, environment sensing systems, and public safety systems produce large volumes of data. To process these data, it requires substantial computing and storage resources for smooth implementation and execution. While centralized cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and resource sharing, it faces significant limitations in IoT-based applications, especially in terms of latency, bandwidth, security, and cost. The fog computing paradigm complements the existing cloud computing services at the edge of the network to facilitate the various services without sending the data to a centralized cloud server. By processing the data in fog computing, it satisfies the delay requirement of various time-sensitive services of IoT applications. However, many resource-intensive IoT systems exist that require substantial computing resources for their processing. In such scenarios, finding the optimal computing node for processing and executing the service is a challenge. The optimal placement of various IoT applications services in heterogeneous fog computing environments is a well-known NP-complete problem. To solve this problem, various authors proposed different algorithms like the randomized algorithm, heuristic algorithm, meta heuristic algorithm, machine learning algorithm, and graph-based algorithm for finding the optimal placement. In the present survey, we first describe the fundamental and mathematical aspects of the three-layer IoT–fog–cloud computing model. Then, we classify the IoT application model based on different attributes that help to find the optimal computing node. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis of the service placement problem in detail. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of both single-objective and multi-objective IoT service placement strategies in fog computing. Additionally, we highlight new challenges and identify promising directions for future research, specifically in the context of multi-objective IoT service optimization. © 2025 by the authors.","Apat, Hemant Kumar School of Computer Applications, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, 751024, India; Goswami, Veena Department of Computer Science Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, 769008, India; Sahoo, Bibhudatta Biomedical Sensors & Systems Lab, University of Memphis, Memphis, 38152, TN, United States; Barik, Rabindra K.

Co-producing a safe mobility and falls informatics platform to drive meaningful quality improvement in the hospital setting: A mixed-methods protocol for the insightFall study,"Introduction Manual investigation of falls incidents for quality improvement is time-consuming for clinical staff. Routine care delivery generates a large volume of relevant data in disparate systems, yet these data are seldom integrated and transformed into real-time, actionable insights for frontline staff. This protocol describes the co-design and testing of a safe mobility and falls informatics platform for automated, real-time insights to support the learning response to inpatient falls. Methods Underpinned by the learning health system model and human-centred design principles, this mixed-methods study will involve (1) collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, data scientists and researchers to co-design a safe mobility and falls informatics platform; (2) co-production of natural language processing pipelines and integration with a user interface for automated, near-real-time insights and (3) platform usability testing. Platform features (data taxonomy and insights display) will be co-designed during workshops with lay partners and clinical staff. The data to be included in the informatics platform will be curated from electronic health records and incident reports within an existing secure data environment, with appropriate data access approvals and controls. Exploratory analysis of a preliminary static dataset will examine the variety (structured/unstructured), veracity (accuracy/completeness) and value (clinical utility) of the data. Based on these initial insights and further consultation with lay partners and clinical staff, a final data extraction template will be agreed. Natural language processing pipelines will be co-produced, clinically validated and integrated with QlikView. Prototype testing will be underpinned by the Technology Acceptance Model, comprising a validated survey and think-aloud interviews to inform platform optimisation.

Enhancing Blended Learning Evaluation Through a Blockchain and Searchable Encryption Approach,"With the rapid development of information technology, blended learning has become a crucial aspect of modern education. However, the fragmented use of various teaching platforms, such as Xuexitong and Rain Classroom, has led to the dispersion of teaching data. This not only increases the cognitive load on teachers and students but also hinders the systematic recording of teaching activities and learning outcomes. Moreover, existing blended learning evaluation systems exhibit significant shortcomings in large-scale data storage and secure sharing. To address these issues, this study designs a blended teaching evaluation management system based on blockchain and searchable encryption. First, an on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage model is established using the Ethereum blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure secure and large-scale storage of student work data. Next, a role-based access control scheme utilizing smart contracts is proposed to effectively prevent unauthorized access. Simultaneously, a searchable encryption scheme is designed using AES-CBC-256 and SHA-256 algorithms, enabling data sharing while safeguarding data privacy. Additionally, the smart contract comprehensively records students’ grade information, including weekly regular scores, midterm scores, final scores, overall scores, and their rankings, ensuring transparency in the evaluation process. Based on these technical solutions, a general-purpose teaching evaluation management system (B-Education) is developed. The experimental results demonstrate that the system accurately records teaching activities and learning outcomes, improving the transparency of teaching evaluations while ensuring data security and privacy. The system’s gas consumption remains within a reasonable range, demonstrating good flexibility and usability. Educational institutions can flexibly configure course evaluation criteria and adjust the weighting of various grades based on their specific needs. This study provides an innovative solution for blended teaching evaluation, offering significant theoretical value and practical implications. © 2025 by the authors.","Ren, Fei Key Laboratory of Educational Informatization for Nationalities, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, 650500, China","Ren, Fei and Zhao, Bo and Wang, Jun and Zhou, Ju-Xiang and Xie, Tian-Yu",10.3390/electronics14051039,UNKNOWN,20799292,Electronics (Switzerland),2025,False
Overcoming Barriers to the Adoption of Decision Support Systems in Integrated Pest Management in Some European Countries,"Decision support systems (DSSs) can improve decision making in integrated pest management (IPM), but are still underutilised despite proven environmental and economic benefits. To overcome the barriers to DSS adoption, this study analyses survey data from 31 farmers and 94 farm advisors, researchers and developers across 11 European countries. Using machine learning techniques, respondents were first categorised into clusters based on their responses to the questionnaire. The clusters were then explained using classification trees. For each cluster, customised approaches were proposed to overcome the barriers to DSS adoption. For farmers, these include building trust through co-development, offering free trials, organising practical workshops and providing clear instructions for use. For farm advisors and researchers, involvement in the development of DSS and giving them access to information about the characteristics of the DSS is crucial. IPM DSS developers should focus on 14 key recommendations to improve trust and the ease of use, increase the transparency of DSS descriptions and validation, and extend development to underserved sectors such as viticulture and vegetable farming. These recommendations aim to increase the uptake of DSSs to ultimately improve the implementation of IPM practises and help reduce the risk and use of pesticides across Europe despite the ever-growing challenges in agriculture. © 2025 by the authors.","Marinko, Jurij Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia; Kuzmanovski, Vladimir Department of Knowledge Technologies, Jožef Stefan Institute, SI, Ljubljana, 1000, Slovenia; Ramsden, Mark RSK ADAS Ltd., WA, Cambridge, 6 0AR, United Kingdom","Marinko, Jurij and Kuzmanovski, Vladimir and Ramsden, Mark and Debeljak, Marko",10.3390/agronomy15020426,UNKNOWN,20734395,Agronomy,2025,False
Electricity terminal multi-label recognition with a “one-versus-all” rejection recognition algorithm based on adaptive distillation increment learning and attention MobileNetV2 network for non-invasive load monitoring,"With the integration of distributed renewable energy into smart grids, the uncertainty of distributed systems and new energy generation seriously affect the stable operation of power grids. Demand-side management is a method for solving distributed electricity usage issues, thus monitoring the types of loads connected to the system has become a hot research topic. Load monitoring includes invasive load monitoring (ILM) and non-invasive load monitoring (NILM). Currently, NILM lacks an incremental capability and has a low recognition accuracy. The study proposes an electricity terminal multi-label recognition with a “One-Versus-All” rejection recognition algorithm based on adaptive distillation increment learning and attention MobileNetV2 network (ET-MR “OVA” RR-ADIL-AMN). The algorithm combines multi-label recognition with a “One-Versus-All” rejection recognition algorithm (MR “OVA” RR), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive distillation increment learning (ADIL), attention MobileNetV2 network (AMN) for electricity terminal recognition. The AMN consists of channel attention mechanism (CAM), co-attention, and MobileNetV2. The CAM significantly enhances the ability to characterize different channels, while the co-attention mechanism focuses on the spatial dimension to extract information about the feature map at different locations. The MobileNetV2 network is employed to optimize computational efficiency and model size through an inverted residual structure, depth separable convolution (DSC), and a linear bottleneck layer. The integration of attention mechanisms (AMs) into MobileNetV2 allows the model not only to maintain the original computational efficiency but also to process input data more efficiently than the MobileNetV2 network by dynamically readjusting the weights of the feature channels and spatial information. ADIL includes an adaptive distillation selector (ADS) and a variable learning rate controller (VLRC). The ADS can select suitable distillation samples by introducing distillation strategies. The distillation strategy allows the algorithm to absorb new categories of information while retaining the learning of old knowledge, contributing to balancing the transfer of old and new knowledge and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The VLRC can reduce the learning rate in the specific direction of the co-attention mechanism, preventing shocks during the incremental learning process. The MR “OVA” RR algorithm adopts a “One-Versus-All” strategy to convert multi-label problems into many binary classification problems (BCPs). The rejection recognition operation is accomplished by comparing the confidence probability values output by SVM with a set threshold. By incorporating a rejection recognition strategy into multi-label recognition, unreliable decisions of the classifier are retained, consequently enhancing the accuracy of load type recognition. Experimental results show that ADIL saves 49 min compared to retraining after completing the incremental learning task for all 10 load types. After integrating the MR “OVA” RR algorithm, the average accuracy of the first-round model reaches 97.13 %. When the rejection recognition samples are inputted into a simple MobileNetV2 model for identification, the accuracy of the overall algorithm reaches 99.84 %. In contrast to other neural networks, the AMN demonstrates optimal performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98.38.60 %, 98.27 %, 98.31 %, and 98.38 % respectively, showing improvements of 2.78 %, 2.21 %, 2.53 %, and 2.78 %. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Yin, Linfei Guangxi Key Laboratory of Power System Optimization and Energy Technology, Guangxi University, Guangxi, Nanning, 530004, China","Yin, Linfei and Wang, Nannan and Li, Jishen",10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125307,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False

"Behavioural Systems Mapping of Solid Waste Management in Kisumu, Kenya, to Understand the Role of Behaviour in a Health and Sustainability Problem","Poor solid waste management in Kisumu, Kenya, contributes to adverse health, social, and environmental outcomes as a result of open burning, illegal dumping, and reliance on landfills. Taking Kisumu as a case study, we use behavioural systems mapping (BSM) for the purpose of understanding the role of behaviour in this complex problem. We qualitatively analysed transcripts from focus groups and interviews with 45 stakeholders in Kisumu to construct a BSM of the perceived actors, behaviours, and behavioural influences affecting waste management, as well as causal links. Influences were analysed using the capability, opportunity, and motivation model of behaviour (COM-B). The resulting BSM connects 24 behaviours by 12 different actors and 49 unique influences (30 related to opportunity, 16 to motivation, and 3 to capability). It reflects three sub-systems: policy-making, public waste management, and the policy–public interface. Six key feedback loops are described, which suggest that cycles of underfunding are interlinked with problematic practices around the build-up, handling, and segregation of waste and conflicting public and political views around responsibility. We demonstrate how the BSM method can be used with transcript data and provide steps that others can follow to inform the design of systemic behaviour change interventions. Further research to validate and adapt this approach may extend the learnings to other countries and health and sustainability challenges. © 2025 by the authors.","Davan Wetton, Joanna Centre for Behaviour Change, Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, WC1E 7HB, United Kingdom; Santilli, Micaela African Population and Health Research Center, P.O.

Hydraulic Microhabitats at a Regulated River Confluence Influence Chinook Salmon Migratory Routing During Drought,"Successful upstream adult migration of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) from estuary to spawning grounds is critical to population recovery, especially during increasingly extreme droughts that degrade migratory habitat. In regulated systems, river confluences can pose significant navigation impediments given complex operational flow release criteria and other cumulative effects. Differing discharge magnitudes and ratios between tributaries may cause divergent confluence hydraulics and hydraulic microhabitat selectivity, influencing migratory routing. This study asks with respect to confluences: (1) Do magnitudes of discharge in each confluence tributary (and resulting combined discharge) influence availability of preferred hydraulic microhabitats in one river versus the other? (2) Does the ratio of discharge magnitudes influence availability of preferred hydraulic microhabitats in one river versus the other? We used data collected from California Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at the confluence of the Feather and Yuba Rivers as a model system to investigate. We combined observations of migratory behavioural responses to hydraulic microhabitats from dual-frequency identification sonars, spatially explicit, meter-resolution hydrodynamic modelling, and machine learning to generate a hydraulic microhabitat selectivity index and simulate upstream migratory pathways for nine pertinent discharge scenarios with four discharge ratios. Statistically significant (p < 0.01) differences in preferred hydraulic habitat were found among both discharge scenarios and ratios, with the Feather River selected in five out of nine scenarios. Discharge magnitude and ratio act as controls on distribution of preferred hydraulic microhabitats, and under certain conditions relevant to drought operations in this system, they can influence migratory routing and propensity of straying. © 2024 The Author(s).

What are end-users' needs and preferences for a comprehensive e-health program for type 2 diabetes? - A qualitative user preference study,"Introduction Type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence is rising, which imposes a significant burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and economies worldwide. Lifestyle factors contribute significantly to the escalating incidence of T2D. Consequently, there is an increasing need for interventions that not only target at-risk populations for prevention but also empower individuals with T2D to achieve better self-management and possibly attain remission through sustained lifestyle modifications. Technological tools may improve health outcomes compared to traditional in-person care, and can include registration of important health parameters, provide follow-up and support, and enhance self-management. The aim of this study was to receive feedback from end-users to inform the development of a comprehensive e-health program focusing on lifestyle modification in pre-diabetes and T2D. Methods During eight focus group meetings, sixteen adults with pre-diabetes or T2D from all over Norway informed the study about needs and preferences for an e-health program, including essential functionalities and design choices. A questionnaire and paper prototyping were used to complement the discussions in the focus group meetings. Results Lack of necessary diabetes knowledge was common, and education was considered essential for improved self-management. Essential functionalities included registration and overview of several health parameters, long-term follow-up and coaching through communication platforms within the program, automatic data transfer from different devices such as blood glucose monitors and smartwatches, and educational courses. To ensure end-users’ satisfaction with the program and increase motivation for long-term usage, the participants rendered tailoring of desired functionalities and content as crucial. Conclusion Based on the findings, a list of recommendations was created, containing the most crucial functionalities and features to include when developing e-health and/or m-health tools for people with pre-diabetes and T2D. Future work should include health care personnel to explore their needs and preferences, and ways such an e-health program may enhance patient interaction without increasing workload and resource use. © 2025 Rishaug et al.

"Profiles of instructional practices and associations with teachers’ self-efficacy, classroom autonomy, teacher collaboration, and school climate in Korea","The dearth of large-scale profile studies in the context of the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) has limited the understanding of classroom praxis and factors that predict instructional practices. To fill this gap, we employed the data from the 2018 Teaching and learning international survey to identify instructional profiles of Korean schoolteachers in relation to cognitive activation, the clarity of instruction, classroom management, and the use of enhanced activities. We then examined how teachers’ perceived self-efficacy, satisfaction with classroom autonomy, engagement in teacher collaboration, and school climate differed across each profile. A latent profile analysis revealed four distinct profiles: Laissez-faire, Controlling, Typical, and Versatile, primarily distinguished by the use of classroom management practices. First, Laissez-faire and Controlling teachers reported strong levels of self-efficacy in classroom management. Second, as satisfaction with classroom autonomy increased, the likelihood of belonging to the Controlling and Versatile profiles increased. Third, collaboration was the key to Versatile profile membership. Fourth, innovative instructional practices and a positive school climate were related. Finally, controlling membership was associated with a negative school climate and a low sense of efficacy in engaging students. These findings have important implications for professional development programs and policies in the Korean educational system. © Education Research Institute, Seoul National University 2023.","Jang, Jaehong Byulnae Elementary School, Seoul, South Korea; Yoo, Hawon Department of Education, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea; Rubadeau, Ksan Institute of Foreign Language Studies, Korea University, 208A, International Studies Hall, 145 Anam-Ro, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul, 02841, South Korea","Jang, Jaehong and Yoo, Hawon and Rubadeau, Ksan",10.1007/s12564-023-09892-8,UNKNOWN,15981037,Asia Pacific Education Review,2025,False

Methods From the perspective of students, a virtual simulation experimental project for nursing of acute leukemia patients was constructed, which including four modules:knowledge preview, virtual simulation practice mode, virtual simulation test mode, and experimental evaluation and feedback. The project involved six categories of response actions, namely, safety, communication, assessment, intervention, medication/intravenous management, and effect evaluation. The project was applied to the experimental teaching of leukemia for 78 undergraduate nursing students from the 2020 and 2021 grades at one university. After the teaching, students' training duration, number of visits, and experimental scores were collected. A self-designed questionnaire was used to invite students to evaluate the system and teaching effects. Results In the practice mode, students visited 3 (1, 5) times with an online training duration ranging from 29 to 346 [53(48, 132)] minutes, and the average practice score was (78.34±16.96) points. In the assessment mode, students scored (92.28±4.75) points with an exam duration of (45.09±5.23) minutes. Besides, 84.6%(66/78) of students rated ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the system overall, 78.2%(61/78) found the system ""easy"" or ""very easy"" to use, and 80.8%(63/78) considered the system ""effective"" or ""very effective"" in terms of effectiveness. Between 75.6% and 93.6% of students agreed that the virtual simulation experimental project had several positive teaching effects, including improving the ability to observe leukemia conditions, exercising clinical thinking in leukemia, enhancing nurse-patient communication skills, stimulating interest in learning about leukemia, improving leukemia nursing abilities and strengthening the spirit of humanistic care, and enhancing the level of related operational skills covered in the project.

Adaptive reinforcement learning for energy management – A progressive approach to boost climate resilience and energy flexibility,"Energy management in urban areas is challenging due to diverse energy users, dynamics environmental conditions, and the added complexity and instability of extreme weather events. We incorporate adaptive reinforcement learning (ARL) into energy management (EM) and introduce a novel approach, called ARLEM. An online, value-based, model-free ARL engine is designed that updates its policy periodically and partially by replacing less favorable actions with those better adapted to evolving environmental conditions. Multiple policy update mechanisms are assessed, varying based on the frequency and length of updates and the action selection criteria. ARLEM is tested to control the energy performance of typical urban blocks in Madrid and Stockholm considering 17 future climate scenarios for 2040–2069. Each block contains 24 buildings of different types and ages. In Madrid, ARLEM is tested for a summer with two heatwaves and in Stockholm for a winter with two cold waves. Three performance indicators are defined to evaluate the effectiveness and resilience of different control approaches during extreme weather events. ARLEM demonstrates an ability to increase climate resilience in the studied blocks by increasing energy flexibility in the network and reducing both average and peak energy demands while affecting indoor thermal comfort marginally. Since the approach does not require any information about the system dynamics, it is easy to cope with the complexities of building systems and technologies, making it an affordable technology to control large urban areas with diverse types of buildings. © 2025","Nik, Vahid M.

A hierarchical deep learning-based recurrent convolutional neural network for robust voltage and frequency operation management in microgrids,"Microgrids (MGs) integrate various dynamic energy sources, often making it challenging for traditional control techniques to manage these complexities. This study addresses key requirements faced by MG systems, particularly in the robust regulation of voltage and frequency (V/F) components. The proposed two-coating and layer control strategy aims to optimize MG operation effectively. To determine the coefficients for the power droop controller (PDC), a novel method called the hierarchical deep learning-based recurrent convolutional neural network (HDL-RCNN) is presented. This method incorporates feedback from system components and formats the measured data into a grid structure before inputting it into the RCNN platform. This formatting allows for the automatic extraction of temporal and spatial features crucial for V/F stability. The RCNN architecture includes several layers, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, convolutional layers, highly coupled layers, and other cascaded features. Results show significant improvements in voltage and frequency control: voltage oscillations in MG1 were reduced from 0.028pu to 0.004pu, and frequency fluctuations in MG2 decreased from 0.025pu to 0.007pu. Additionally, the method ensures the voltage stabilizes at 1pu, with minimal fluctuations, and provides robust performance across dynamic load changes and noisy conditions. These findings were validated through extensive testing on a MATLAB/Simulink platform, demonstrating the effectiveness of the HDL-RCNN in enhancing V/F stability and operational reliability in MGs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Khosravi, Nima Centre of Research Impact and Outcome, Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, Rajpura, 140401, India; Abdolmohammadi, Hamid Reza Electrical and Computer Engineering Group, Golpayegan College of Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Golpayegan, 87717-67498, Iran","Khosravi, Nima and Abdolmohammadi, Hamid Reza",10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112645,UNKNOWN,15684946,Applied Soft Computing,2025,False

IntelliGrid AI: A Blockchain and Deep-Learning Framework for Optimized Home Energy Management with V2H and H2V Integration,"Featured Application: IntelliGrid AI revolutionizes smart home energy management by integrating blockchain, deep learning, and vehicle-to-home (V2H) technology, enabling optimized energy consumption, secure peer-to-peer energy trading, and adaptive scheduling. It demonstrated that 20% reduction in energy costs and scalability makes it ideal for renewable-powered communities and smart city applications. The integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles has become a focal point for industries and academia due to its profound economic, environmental, and technological implications. These developments require the development of a robust intelligent home energy management system (IHEMS) to optimize energy utilization, enhance transaction security, and ensure grid stability. For this reason, this paper develops an IntelliGrid AI, an advanced system that integrates blockchain technology, deep learning (DL), and dual-energy transmission capabilities—vehicle to home (V2H) and home to vehicle (H2V). The proposed approach can dynamically optimize household energy flows, deploying real-time data and adaptive algorithms to balance energy demand and supply. Blockchain technology ensures the security and integrity of energy transactions while facilitating decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. The core of IntelliGrid AI is an advanced Q-learning algorithm that intelligently allocates energy resources. V2H enables electric vehicles to power households during peak periods, reducing the strain on the grid. Conversely, H2V technology facilitates the efficient charging of electric cars during peak hours, contributing to grid stability and efficient energy utilization. Case studies conducted in Tunisia validate the system’s performance, showing a 20% reduction in energy costs and significant improvements in transaction efficiency. These results highlight the practical benefits of integrating V2H and H2V technologies into innovative energy management frameworks. © 2025 by the authors.","Binyamin, Sami The Applied College, King Abdulaziz University, P.O.

Designing Deep Reinforcement Learning enhanced edge-terminal collaborative AIoT for Intelligent Visitor Management System,"Intelligent Visitor Management System (IVMS) is crucial for enhancing security and operational efficiency in smart factories and intelligent office buildings. Leveraging AIoT-driven image analysis will facilitate real-time visitor authentication and access control. However, the growing volume of interactions and the limited processing power of local terminals complicate the delivery of timely and accurate image analysis. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-terminal collaborative AIoT framework for real-time visitor management. The framework solves the limitations of traditional approaches, where local terminals are unable to handle the computational load and edge solutions experience high latency due to transmission delays. Specifically, it integrates three key components to improve system performance: a local analysis module for initial processing, an image communication module for efficient data transmission, and an edge analysis module for advanced processing. Moreover, the framework jointly optimizes image task offloading, wireless channel allocation, and image compression, all formulated as an optimization problem to ensure fast and accurate analysis. Additionally, a novel multi-level Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is further designed to dynamically refine the selection of compression and offloading strategies. By learning in real-time, the DRL model adapts to network variations, addressing the scalability and adaptability limitations of existing methods. Simulation results show that our proposed edge-terminal collaborative AIoT framework significantly outperforms both edge-only and terminal-only methods in terms of latency and accuracy. © 2025","Liao, Yong School of Communications and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China; Zhu, Zhiyuan Advanced Network and Intelligent Connection Technology, Key Laboratory of Chongqing Education Commission of China, Chongqing, 400065, China; Tang, Tong Chongqing Key Laboratory of Ubiquitous Sensing and Networking, Chongqing, 400065, China","Liao, Yong and Zhu, Zhiyuan and Tang, Tong and Wu, Dapeng and Wang, Ruyan",10.1016/j.adhoc.2025.103756,UNKNOWN,15708705,Ad Hoc Networks,2025,False

What I Wish I Had Known: Examining Parent Accounts of Managing the Health of Their Child With Intellectual Disability,"Background: Appropriate support for the health of children with an intellectual disability by parents and healthcare professionals is pivotal, given the high risk of chronic conditions. However, there is limited research that has collected important insights from parents on their learnings for supporting their child's evolving healthcare needs. Aim: This study focuses on parents' experiences and learnings from managing and supporting the health of their child with intellectual disability. It aims to understand what parents wish they had known earlier, the essential knowledge and skills they needed to manage their child's health. Method: A qualitative study was carried out using semi-structured interviews with 21 parents of adolescents and young people with intellectual disability. The children had chronic health conditions that fell into six health domains, including (1) difficulties with movement and physical activity, (2) epilepsy, (3) dental care, (4) respiratory health and infection, (5) behaviour, mental health or sleep and (6) gastrointestinal health. Results: Thematic analysis yielded five themes: (1) optimising mutual engagement between healthcare professionals and families; (2) planning and practising effective healthcare; (3) having the right information at the right time; (4) finding the support that was needed and (5) navigating healthcare and disability systems. Over time, parents developed specific skills and knowledge for managing their child's health effectively. Some parents expressed regret for not seeking support and information about their child's health conditions earlier. Parents described how mutual engagement between healthcare professionals and parents optimised the management of their child's healthcare. Conclusion: The study found that managing the health of a child with intellectual disability is complex. The themes were consistent across health comorbidities, indicating important common experiences. The themes aligned with conceptualisations of health literacy, suggesting that improving health literacy skills can help parents better manage their children's health conditions. Patient or Public Contribution: We developed the project in consultation with members of the public who have lived experience of parenting a child with intellectual disability.

Enhancing difficult airway management training: the role of virtual reality and adaptive learning,"Emergency physicians play a central role in healthcare. They often must make quick and accurate decisions to save patients’ lives. Among the critical procedures they have to master is difficult airway management (DAM), a procedure required to establish and maintain a patient’s airway for adequate ventilation and oxygenation. To ensure optimal proficiency in DAM, the clinical skills that comprise this procedure must be regularly practiced and updated. However, traditional training approaches present significant organizational challenges in terms of time and cost. In response to these issues, we have developed an innovative education and training application employing immersive Virtual Reality (VR) for teaching basic to advanced DAM procedures, supported by an Adaptive Learning system. To evaluate the effectiveness of our DAM training system, we conducted experiments with a control group trained using traditional methods and two VR subgroups, one with and one without the Adaptive Learning component.

Applications of unmanned vehicle systems for multi-spatial scale monitoring and management of aquatic ecosystems: A review,"Aquatic ecosystems are facing intensifying challenges, such as pollution, habitat destruction, and climate perturbations; hence, high-resolution, cost-effective monitoring tools are becoming increasingly important to provide timely and accurate data for effective conservation and management strategies. This review investigates the crucial role of unmanned vehicle systems (UVS) in conducting multi-spatial scale monitoring across different facets of aquatic ecosystems, including ecosystem habitat, algal bloom, vegetation conditions, and animal behaviors. Using a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review techniques, we assess UVS applications over the past decade (2013−2023), track research trends and evaluate the effectiveness, challenges, and prospects of UVS technologies. Our findings reveal a 12-fold increase in UVS applications in aquatic research during this period, with 60–70 % focusing on habitat monitoring and animal behavior research, and less than 10 % addressing algal blooms and eutrophication. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), representing 70 % of the published applications, have been the primary research instrument, outpacing Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles/Remotely Operated Vehicles (AUV/ROV). While enhancing monitoring at various scales with broad coverage, integrated applications between UAVs and USVs or AUVs/ROVs still need to solve crucial issues, such as weather impacts, communication complexities, and data processing needs. The systematic analysis highlights the gap in UVS applications for multi-spatial scale monitoring and reveals significant opportunities for integrating UVS with Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which are improving UVS integration, security, and efficiency, and enabling better resource management and navigation accuracy. Furthermore, object tracking, Digital Image Processing (DIP), Geographic Information System (GIS), and data management platforms enable efficient, multi-spatial scale monitoring and advanced research capabilities, offering the potential to enhance data collection and management of aquatic ecosystems. © 2024","Liu, Xingzhen Department of Animal Sciences and Aquatic Ecology, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium","Liu, Xingzhen and Ho, Long and Bruneel, Stijn and Goethals, Peter",10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102926,UNKNOWN,15749541,Ecological Informatics,2025,False
Generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: A pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin,"Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures. © 2025 The Authors","Huang, Jeffrey Institute of Computer and Communication Sciences (IINFCOM), School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), Media and Design Laboratory (LDM), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland","Huang, Jeffrey and Bibri, Simon Elias and Keel, Paul",10.1016/j.ese.2025.100526,UNKNOWN,26664984,Environmental Science and Ecotechnology,2025,False
Investigating EFL Students' Experiences and Perceptions about Blackboard in the Preparatory Year,"This study investigated university students' experiences and perceptions about using the Blackboard online learning management system in the Preparatory Year at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University, Dammam, KSA. Blackboard has been used as a technological tool to support students' blended learning and seamless involvement by means of a set of integrated features. The study used a mixed-methods descriptive explanatory design including quantitative and qualitative tools. A survey was administered to 225 male and female students from a population of 756 participants with various levels of English language competency (beginner, intermediate and advanced). The results indicated that Blackboard had numerous positive effects on university students' attitudes owing to its convenience, effectiveness, and flexibility in learning without place and time constraints. They also revealed that university students encountered no technical difficulties in using all the built-in features thanks to their prior knowledge of Blackboard. Finally, the study included several recommendations for enhancing the use of this learning tool based on current research findings and students' suggestions. © Authors Sami Al-Mubireek, Ahmed Momene, Montasser Mahmoud IJLTER.ORG.

"Correction to: Introducing listening as a weak method for advancing sustainability and interdisciplinary scholarship (Sustainability Science, (2025), 20, 1, (77-94), 10.1007/s11625-024-01571-w)","In this article, the layout of table1, table 2 and boxes were incorrectly processed. These should appear as in this correction. The original article has been corrected. The SMARTer Greener Cities project gathered twelve researchers with diverse backgrounds and levels of seniority, (seven of which are co-authors of the manuscript), from five research institutions, situated in four countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, USA) (Table 2). Such structure and arrangement are common to projects in sustainability research, making it an instructive real-life case. The project was designed to be interdisciplinary with a work package dedicated to theoretical integration and synthesis across three different experimental case studies, each with a separate set of methods, objectives, and research leaders. The Social–Ecological–Technological Systems (SETS) framework was used to foster such integration. During the process, the team realised the need for an even softer and more inclusive method for integration before we could successfully apply the SETS framework across the case studies. From that point, the listening framework guided our collaboration and enabled us to connect insights across case studies, apply SETS with much more ease, and overcome the roadblocks. The aim of overcoming these roadblocks is to maintain the collaboration in an I/TD mode, providing greater integration, convergence and cross-communication than a mono-disciplinary or multidisciplinary mode of collaboration, as shown in Fig. 2. Each mode engages with the listening process to a different degree, shaping the amount of integration achieved and the time required, illustrated as increasingly greater overlap between the framework (open arrow circle) and individual disciplines (dark arrows). Awareness of these modes of collaboration brings clarity around their objectives and the various impediments to realising them. Participants naturally will engage in or move through different modes of collaborating at once, in a single meeting or partnership. In discussion, we explore how the practice of good listening can help a group stay more effectively in or return to the I/TD mode by balancing convergence with pluralism in ways that lead to exchange and enrichment, without necessitating consensus. One of the persistent roadblocks facing sustainability science is the question of who is in the room and feels able to participate. Missing voices—from different academic disciplines, educational, or cultural backgrounds; from people of diverse races, genders, ethnicities, and languages—limit the range, scope, and effectiveness of sustainability solutions. Moreover, being present is not the same as having a voice or being heard. All too often a limited spectrum of viewpoints and knowledges are present in sustainability science spaces. When care is taken to include more diverse perspectives it is not always followed by appropriate framing and organising the conversation to support the inclusion of diverse perspectives. While this challenge rests on the choices of individuals to convene and structure collaborations, it is also a deeply structural challenge. Ideas about what knowledge is, how and where it is produced, and who is involved are shaped and reinforced by systemic, identity-based inequalities, the structure of universities, the organisation and allocation of funding, and mechanisms of policy creation and implementation. While listening alone is not adequate to the task of dismantling structural, systemic hierarchies and inequalities, we believe it can help scholars and practitioners address some of the effects. First, Receiving, as the first step of good listening, asks us to open up and consider what is not being heard and to be curious about what signals we could pick up if we turned our attention to them. Second, Interpretation, as part of a framework for good listening, provides a guide for how to work across difference, acknowledging that not all signals will initially make sense. Rather than ignoring nonsensical voices, or requiring their revision to fit pre-determined formats, good listening urges us to examine our own values and assumptions with mindfulness, to reach for different mental models and new explanatory information with curiosity and cognitive complexity, and to engage in dialogue via being wrong with intellectual humility, asking questions and experimenting to find shared meaning with empathy, care and compassion. Finally, listening itself supports initiating collaboration. Framing first steps as listening can build trust and establish a space for curiosity and learning without the goal of reaching conclusions or solutions right away. Participation in academic collaborations to a large extent is pre-determined by project proposals. It was also true for the Smarter Greener Cities project (see Box 1) which aimed to achieve a balance in gender and seniority, in line with the listening framework attribute of inclusive participation. Work on nature-based solutions in cities transcends academic boundaries, therefore, guided by the curiosity of good listening, case study owners created local knowledge alliances and organised three living pavilions in three capital cities to expand the breadth of perspectives beyond the walls of the project and enable a channel for feedback. In one event, we emphasised the plurality of paths for achieving a goal of “listening to the voices of nature”, as promoted by the intellectual humility and cognitive complexity of good listening. Also, in line with empathy and compassion of good listening, these events redistributed the power of academic knowledge by giving a stage and more space to non-academic voices, such as artists, chefs, urban planners, city officials, psychologists and ecological entrepreneurs and facilitated more collaborations. Closely related to issues concerning who is in the room are those connected to group dynamics. Here, I/TD collaborations must contend with several challenges, including the outsize role and reliance on facilitators, management of personalities, and variation in individuals’ qualities as a participant. For example, there can be a tendency to rely on designated facilitators to do the work of listening and bridging, which can simultaneously overwhelm these individuals (frequently sustainability scientists themselves, not professional facilitators) and absolve participants of these responsibilities. There can also be dominant voices—due to length of experience, seniority, or identity—that risk drowning out younger or less empowered participants. Digital technologies can structure unequal participation platforms, as digital meetings make using non-verbal facilitation cues more challenging and hybrid forums may privilege in-person dialogue over inclusion of remote participants. Such disproportion can also result from individual qualities; some participants will have more comfort or experience “putting themselves out there” while others prefer more quiet, observational roles. Moreover, in sustainability science one might be coming to the collaboration with strong, individually held views regarding particular ideas or methods that motivate engagement. There are both individual and structural reasons for challenges related to group dynamics, and we find that our framework for good listening, which traverses a course from individual to structural considerations, to be useful. Once again, the framework itself can be used as a tool for structuring group processes (as discussed above), but is also a tool that can be given to individuals within the group to help guide them in how to participate. Receiving reiterates the importance of being present, caring and curious, and paying attention to where and how signals are being transmitted. Such an orientation can support collectively defining and performing roles, particularly with regard to facilitation, and support sensitive awareness with regards to digital or hybrid forms. Framing engagement in this way asks all to take part in facilitation. Loud voices are reminded to soften or to be silent to receive information, but also to be mindful about their power and predisposition to speak and are encouraged to practise intellectual humility. They are aware that by doing so they enhance the quality of the collaboration by unlocking creativity in the group, building trust and deeply human working relationships, increasing engagement and commitment to the initiative and more. Quiet voices are reminded that there are aspiring good listeners in the room who are open and curious toward a diversity of voices, who wish to gain a wider understanding and are willing to engage in Feedback if they do not initially understand. Under such light, sharing their perspective would be a gift. Building a collaboration on the strong foundation of the listening framework not only encourages quiet voices to speak and be heard but also to be more engaged and better integrated in the collaboration. Good listeners set the tone for more inclusive communication by decreasing the amount of judgement and bias while maximising creativity and supporting more complex thinking. Although the scope of the project was developed by a team of senior scholars it still gave opportunities for early career researchers to lead joint projects. Such freedom and flexibility aligns with the intellectual humility and care of good listening that redistributes leadership and widens perspectives. This was further supported by an exchange of postdocs who, due to the COVID pandemic, relied on digital means to collaborate. Their collaboration applied the SETS framework to combine smart and green cities agendas (Branny et al. 2022). However, it was a challenge to maintain and support high quality receiving, processing and interpretation, required for good listening. To address this challenge using the attributes of presence, curiosity and cognitive complexity, we incorporated regular check-ins, mindfulness exercises, and mixed and small group discussions in our meetings and workshops. Sustainability science frequently requires working across differences of theory, method, epistemology and ontology. To work with and in spite of these differences there is a need to embrace shared goals, methods and products, the definition of which is often a fraught process due to perceived incommensurabilities. For example, epistemological traditions, common in the arts, humanities, and certain social sciences, that locate knowledge in the experience of the particular are often perceived as at odds with ways of knowing, more common in other social sciences and natural sciences, based on the replicability and transportability of findings. If we are to take seriously recent insights that both approaches are needed in sustainability science, then new processes and formats are needed. We anticipate our framework for good listening to be helpful for guiding practitioners of sustainability science through a process of defining shared goals, methods, and outputs as well as pursuing understanding and overcoming perceived incommensurability. This begins with Receiving, wherein curiosity, openness, and a lack of defensiveness encourage actually taking in what another is communicating, which allows diverse knowledges to enter the collaboration. This is followed by Processing, and particularly the opportunity for group processing. Here, the work of translating, connecting, and contextualising can be made explicit and engaged collaboratively and iteratively, for the ultimate goal of a good listening process is mutual intelligibility, not being ‘correct’. In our example of epistemological difference, this collective processing would reframe the goal of exchange from integrating different ways of knowing to collectively rendering different epistemological arguments into something everyone can interpret and respond to intelligibly. This would further efforts toward ‘knowledge weaving’, where good listening is not yet fully recognised although it underpins all the stages from mobilisation to application (Tengö et al. 2017), and thus ultimately support a sustainability science that recognises and values different knowledges. © The Author(s) 2025.","Branny, Artur Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden; Maurer, Megan Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark; Andersson, Erik Ecosystems and Environment Research Programme, Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; McPhearson, Timon Research Unit for Environmental Sciences and Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom, United States; Raymond, Christopher M.

Stochastic modeling of electric vehicle infrastructure using queueing-theoretical approach,"Queueing modeling is essential for enhancing battery management technologies, including battery swapping destinations, charging station management, and renewable energy management systems. The present study offers an in-depth analysis of queue-based stochastic modeling for the electric vehicle (EV) industries, extending the previous investigations. This investigation proposes three distinctive stochastic models: a single-server finite capacity queueing model, appropriate for smaller charging stations however restricted by its single-server assumption; a multiple-server finite capacity queueing model, more advantageous for larger stations while still presuming an infinite population; and a finite capacity and finite population queueing model, appropriate for circumstances with a predetermined number of individuals, although slightly more complex to analyze. The corresponding differential-difference equations for each developed model are formulated and examined, taking into account both transient and steady-state behaviors. Closed mathematical expressions of various system performance measurements are demonstrated for each established model to provide a comprehensive statistical overview. Additionally, to highlight the robustness of the finite population queueing model, several illustrations in terms of different graphs and tables are provided and emphasized with the help of an in-depth investigation for comparison purposes. The significant outcomes of the investigation indicate that integrating finite population considerations substantially enhances the accuracy of waiting time predictions, especially during peak demand intervals, in comparison to models that assume infinite populations. This research emphasizes the significance of model selection according to particular application constraints and presents essential managerial insights, such as optimal resource allocation, dynamic pricing strategies, and load balancing techniques, to assist system analysts and decision-makers. Concluding remarks and potential future perspectives are also included, with an emphasis on integrating cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, etc. to enhance adaptive management and model prediction. © 2025 The Author(s)","Varshney, Shreekant Department of Mathematics, School of Technology (SoT), Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Gujarat, Gandhinagar, 382426, India; Panda, Kaibalya Prasad Department of Electrical Engineering, School of Energy Technology (SoET), Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Gujarat, Gandhinagar, 382426, India; Gupta, Mayank Department of Physics, School of Energy Technology (SoET), Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Gujarat, Gandhinagar, 382426, India; Shah, Manthan Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Technology (SoT), Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Gujarat, Gandhinagar, 382426, India; Srinivas, Bhasuru Abhinaya Department of Electrical Engineering, Graphic Era (Deemed to be University), Dehradun, 248002, India; Bajaj, Mohit Hourani Center for Applied Scientific Research, Al-Ahliyya Amman University, Amman, Jordan; Blazek, Vojtech College of Engineering, University of Business and Technology, Jeddah, 21448, Saudi Arabia; Prokop, Lukas ENET Centre, CEET, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava, 708 00, Czech Republic","Varshney, Shreekant and Panda, Kaibalya Prasad and Gupta, Mayank and Shah, Manthan and Srinivas, Bhasuru Abhinaya and Bajaj, Mohit and Blazek, Vojtech and Prokop, Lukas",10.1016/j.rineng.2025.104149,UNKNOWN,25901230,Results in Engineering,2025,False
Development of Neural Networks and Performance Appraisal of Supervised Learning Models for Predicting Organic Carbon in Soils Under Different Cropping Systems,"Accurate prediction of soil organic carbon (TOC) is crucial for assessing soil health, fertility, and ecosystem functions and services. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of various supervised learning models in comparison to neural networks for accurately capturing the complex relationships between soil attributes and TOC in soils under three wheat-based ecosystems (viz. wheat-rice/maize/cotton). The study aimed to identify the most robust and precise models for predicting TOC levels, with the ultimate goal of informing sustainable land management practices and improving soil fertility and health in agricultural systems. We evaluated the performance of eight supervised learning models viz. linear (LR), ridge (RR), lasso (LAR), elastic net (ENR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GBR) and support vector regression (SVR) vis-à-vis artificial neural networks (ANNs) for capturing the complex relationships between soil attributes and TOC in soils under three wheat-based ecosystems. These results revealed that the proportion of micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in soils under rice-wheat system, compared with the other systems which themselves did not differ significantly. However, there was a non-significant (p < 0.05) difference in the proportion of macro-aggregates (> 0.25 mm) amongst the compared wheat-based systems. The proportion of total water stable aggregates (WSA) was significantly higher by ~ 13.1–18.7% for maize-wheat, compared with other systems. Maize-wheat soils exhibited ~ 21.6% reduction in dehydrogenase (DHA) activity as compared to rice-wheat soils. However, cotton-wheat soils exhibiting ~ 28.8% decrease in alkaline-P (Alk-P) activity, compared with rice-wheat soils. These results indicate that ANN8 − 15−1−1 model consisting of Tansig activation function and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm exhibited superior performance in accurately predicting TOC levels. Model (ANN8 − 15−1−1) validation of a comprehensive data-set underscored its robustness and precision with mean squared error (MSE) values of 1.055E-13, 4.950E-11 and 5.561E-03 for training, validation, and testing data-sets, respectively. Nonetheless, high values of the correlation coefficient (R; 0.9964**, 0.9845**, and 0.9989**; p < 0.01, respectively), underscored the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between soil attributes and agricultural practices. Amongst the various supervised learning models evaluated, DT model outperformed, exhibiting the highest coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.997** (p < 0.01). These findings highlight the importance of employing advanced modeling techniques, e.g., ANN and supervised learning algorithms for precise prediction of TOC concentration in agricultural soils. These insights have significant implications for sustainable land management practices, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions regarding soil fertility and health, thereby contributing to the mitigation of land degradation and climate change impacts. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo 2024.","Kaur, Gagandeep Yadavindra Department of Engineering, Talwandi Sabo, Punjab, Bathinda, India; Sharma, Sandeep Department of Soil Science, Punjab Agricultural University, Punjab, Ludhiana, India","Kaur, Gagandeep and Sharma, Sandeep and Singh, Pritpal",10.1007/s42729-024-02182-1,UNKNOWN,07189508,Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition,2025,False
Information Avoidance: Past Perspectives and Future Directions,"In the present age of unprecedented access to information, it is important to understand how and why people avoid information. Multiple definitions of “information avoidance” exist, and key aspects of these definitions deserve attention, such as distinguishing information avoidance from (lack of) information seeking, considering the intentionality and temporal nature of information avoidance, and considering the personal relevance of the information. In this review, we provide a cross-disciplinary historical account of theories and empirical research on information avoidance and seeking, drawing from research in multiple fields. We provide a framework of antecedents of information avoidance, categorized into beliefs about the information (e.g., risk perceptions), beliefs about oneself (e.g., coping resources), and social and situational factors (e.g., social norms), noting that constructs across categories overlap and are intertwined. We suggest that research is needed on both positive and negative consequences of information avoidance and on interventions to reduce information avoidance (when appropriate). Research is also needed to better understand temporal dynamics of information avoidance and how it manifests in everyday life. Finally, comprehensive theoretical models are needed that differentiate avoidance from seeking. Research on information avoidance is quickly expanding, and the topic will only grow in importance. © The Author(s) 2023.","Foust, Jeremy L.

Development of a Hint Suggestion System Based on Student's Learning Status in Server Management Exercises,"In recent years, more and more server administration exercises have been conducted at universities. Some students get stuck on the answer to a task. In this case, the student requests a hint for the task. The teacher hears the student, assesses the progress, and offers a hint. Also, teachers want students to conduct trial and error on a task before asking for hints. Many students ask for hints during exercises, which is a burden for teachers. We develop a system that presents hints based on the student's learning status. The teacher registers the learning status and corresponding hints in the system in advance. The student's command input/output and edited files are monitored by the system to check the student's progress. The system can suggest many hints based on learning status. As a result of the evaluation experiment, unnecessary hints were not presented to the students. Also, the system can guide students to conduct trial and error in the learning situation the teacher expects.

Exploiting Artificial Neural Networks for the State of Charge Estimation in EV/HV Battery Systems: A Review,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) improve battery management in electric vehicles (EVs) by enhancing the safety, durability, and reliability of electrochemical batteries, particularly through improvements in the State of Charge (SOC) estimation. EV batteries operate under demanding conditions, which can affect performance and, in extreme cases, lead to critical failures such as thermal runaway—an exothermic chain reaction that may result in overheating, fires, and even explosions. Addressing these risks requires advanced diagnostic and management strategies, and machine learning presents a powerful solution due to its ability to adapt across multiple facets of battery management. The versatility of ML enables its application to material discovery, model development, quality control, real-time monitoring, charge optimization, and fault detection, positioning it as an essential technology for modern battery management systems. Specifically, ANN models excel at detecting subtle, complex patterns that reflect battery health and performance, crucial for accurate SOC estimation. The effectiveness of ML applications in this domain, however, is highly dependent on the selection of quality datasets, relevant features, and suitable algorithms. Advanced techniques such as active learning are being explored to enhance ANN model performance by improving the models’ responsiveness to diverse and nuanced battery behavior. This compact survey consolidates recent advances in machine learning for SOC estimation, analyzing the current state of the field and highlighting the challenges and opportunities that remain.

Biophysical versus machine learning models for predicting rectal and skin temperatures in older adults,"This study compares the efficacy of machine learning models to traditional biophysical models in predicting rectal (Tre) and skin (Tsk) temperatures of older adults (≥60 years) during prolonged heat exposure. Five machine learning models were trained on data using 4-fold cross validation from 162 day-long (8–9h) sessions involving 76 older adults across six environments, from thermoneutral to heatwave conditions. These models were compared to three biophysical models: the JOS-3 model, the Gagge two-node model, and an optimised two-node model. Our findings show that machine learning models, particularly ridge regression, outperformed biophysical models in prediction accuracy. The ridge regression model achieved a Root-Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.27 °C for Tre, and 0.73 °C for Tsk. Among the best biophysical models, the optimised two-node model achieved an RMSE of 0.40 °C for Tre, while JOS-3 achieved an RMSE of 0.74 °C for Tsk. Of all models, ridge regression had the highest proportion of participants with Tre RMSEs within clinically meaningful thresholds at 70% (<0.3 °C) and the highest proportion for Tsk at 88% (<1.0 °C), tied with the JOS-3 model. Our results suggest machine learning models better capture the complex thermoregulatory responses of older adults during prolonged heat exposure. The study highlights machine learning models' potential for personalised heat risk assessments and real-time predictions. Future research should expand upon training datasets, incorporate more dynamic conditions, and validate models in real-world settings. Integrating these models into home-based monitoring systems or wearable devices could enhance heat management strategies for older adults. © 2025 The Authors","Forbes, Connor School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia; Coccarelli, Alberto Zienkiewicz Institute for Modelling, AI and Data, Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom; Xu, Zhiwei School Medicine and Dentistry, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia; Meade, Robert D.

Reinforcement Neural Network-Based Grid-Integrated PV Control and Battery Management System,"A reinforcement neural network-based grid-integrated photovoltaic (PV) system with a battery management system (BMS) was developed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems. In such a setup, the PV system generates electricity, which can be used immediately, stored in batteries, or fed into the grid. The challenge lies in dynamically optimizing the power flow between these components to minimize energy costs, maximize the use of renewable energy, and maintain grid stability. Reinforcement learning (RL) combined with NNs offers a powerful solution by enabling the system to learn and adapt its energy management strategy in real time. By using the proposed techniques, the convergence time was decreased with lower complexity compared with existing approaches. The RL agent interacts with the environment (i.e., the grid, PV system, and battery), continuously improving its decisions regarding when to store energy, draw from the battery, and supply power to the grid. This intelligent control approach ensures optimal performance, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient energy system. © 2025 by the authors.","Thajeel, Salah Mahdi Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Altınbaş University, Istanbul, 34218, Türkiye","Thajeel, Salah Mahdi and Atilla, Doğu Çağdaş",10.3390/en18030637,UNKNOWN,19961073,Energies,2025,False
Software Architecture for Autonomous Vehicles using MATLAB Simulink,"Autonomous vehicles utilise sensors, control systems and machine learning to independently navigate and operate through their surroundings, offering improved road safety, traffic management and enhanced mobility. This paper details the development, software architecture and simulation of control algorithms for key functionalities in a model that approaches Level 2 autonomy, utilising MATLAB Simulink and IPG CarMaker. The focus is on four critical areas: Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Detection (LD) and Traffic Object Detection. Also, the integration of low-level PID controllers for precise steering, braking and throttle actuation, ensures smooth and responsive vehicle behaviour. The hardware architecture is built around the Nvidia Jetson Nano and multiple Arduino Nano microcontrollers, each responsible for controlling specific actuators within the drive-by-wire system, which includes the steering, brake and throttle actuators. Communication between these components is facilitated through the CAN protocol, which ensures accurate and reliable data transfer essential for real-time decision-making. AEB achieves precise emergency braking and enhances driver comfort through the use of PID controllers, while ACC leverages radar data to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. LD employs the Hough Transform algorithm for accurate road edge detection. Furthermore, a trained neural network within the system identifies and responds to traffic signals, signage, pedestrians and vehicles. The camera interfaces directly with the Jetson Nano, while radar data is shared with the IMU through a dedicated CAN bus. This integrated approach represents a significant advancement in autonomous vehicle control, thus contributing to enhanced safety, comfort and reliability for both drivers and passengers. This software architecture is designed based on aBaja 2024 competition and according to its rules, regulations, requirements and specifications, the controllers and simulations were designed.  © 2025 SAE International.

An attention-based dynamic graph model for on-street parking availability prediction,"As cities grow denser, the need for sustainable urban transport solutions intensifies. Effective management of on-street parking is critical in addressing traffic congestion and promoting environmental sustainability. This study presents a machine learning model that leverages complex spatiotemporal dependencies and incorporates essential exogenous factors to accurately predict on-street parking availability. Our approach employs a combination of graph representations-static, dynamic time-warping, and hidden state-generated graphs-to capture distinct aspects of urban parking dynamics. An attention-based fusion mechanism integrates these graphs into a cohesive dynamic graph, providing a refined understanding of parking behavior. The inclusion of external temporal features through advanced gated recurrent units enhances the model's predictive accuracy. Rigorous testing on real datasets demonstrates the model's superior performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.0379 and a mean square error of 0.0067, thereby surpassing existing benchmarks. Our results highlight the model's efficacy as a decision-support tool for urban planners and policymakers, facilitating the development of more efficient and sustainable transport systems. Additionally, the model's interpretability and adaptability make it a valuable tool for better understanding the intricate dynamics of urban parking.

Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for Weld Defect Detection,"The work delves into the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as the critical aspect of quality control in manufacturing for the automated detection and classification of weld defects in Weld components. Weld defects, which encompass various inconsistencies such as corrosion, burn through, and misalignments, can significantly impact the structural integrity and performance of welded parts. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error, which often results in inconsistent and unreliable defect detection. Leveraging the capabilities of CNNs, this study aims to enhance the precision, efficiency, and reliability of weld defect detection processes. By utilizing a robust dataset comprising thousands of high-resolution images of welds, meticulously labeled for different defect types, the CNN model is trained to identify and classify these defects with high accuracy. The integration of IoT systems for real-time image capture and analysis further underscores the potential for CNN-based systems to revolutionize quality assurance in manufacturing by providing immediate feedback and enabling proactive defect management. The paper contains a detailed approach, beginning with the collection and preprocessing of a diverse dataset to train the CNN model, then testing of real weld pieces against the model and what the results imply. The CNN architecture is designed to effectively capture and analyze the patterns associated with different weld defects. Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and loss demonstrates the model's efficacy, achieving a significant improvement over traditional inspection methods. Future work will focus on the study also explores the practical implications of deploying CNN-based defect detection systems in settings, highlighting the possible benefits in terms of cost savings and reduced reliability further refining the model through techniques such as transfer learning and expanding its application to other types of defects and metals, helping to expand the way for broader adoption of AI-driven quality control solutions. © 2025 Author(s).","Balachandran, Nidhi Maya Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (MBCET), Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, India","Balachandran, Nidhi Maya and Subin, Siddarth and Vinu, Vaibhav",10.1063/5.0247694,978-073545105-6,0094243X,AIP Conference Proceedings,2025,False
Implications for developing global health education in China: Evidence from an undergraduate teamwork with role-play,"Background Since 2012, China has had one degreed undergraduate programme in global health for domestic students. The International Health Project Management course is a core component of this programme's curriculum, bridging theoretical knowledge to practice in global health engagement. This study aims to evaluate whether introducing a teamwork and role-play module would meet the learning objectives, including improving students' perception of global health, enhancing their understanding of the management processes for global health projects, and eventually developing competencies for effective global health involvement. Methods The teamwork role-play module was used in a scenario assuming that all students played a specific role in project management in the € Health System Enhancement for Pandemic Preparedness in Southeast and South Asian Countries' programme. This programme called for proposals to implement a project in at least one country in Southeast or South Asia. We conducted a content analysis using two types of materials from the students: (1) concept note and proposal presentations and (2) students' responses to the open-question feedback survey with four questions. Results Students addressed the colonial origins of global health and its evolving definition, emphasising the need for a broader interdisciplinary approach. They perceived China's role in global health as evolving from a recipient to a donor, collaborator or participator, with a focus on enhancing soft power. However, their inadequate background knowledge of global health issues hindered their ability to undertake the tasks in depth. Students provided positive feedback on the teamwork with the role-play module, highlighting improved efficiency, broader and deeper learning through communication, increased participation, etc. Challenges such as poor leadership in teamwork, communication breakdowns and unequal workload distribution were identified. Conclusions Students showed a comprehensive understanding of managing a global health project through their teamwork tasks. Introducing teaching assistants to support teamwork, providing more hands-on opportunities, and integrating a broader range of disciplines into the curriculum will be crucial for the continued development of effective global health education programmes.  © 2025 BMJ Publishing Group.

A non-invasive computer-aided personalized diagnosis system for Osteopenia and Osteoporosis,"Background: Osteoporosis is a common bone related disease that is characterized by a severe decrease in bone mineral density and an elevated risk of fracture. To achieve an effective disease management and fractures avoidance, the detection of the disease at its early stage, the Osteopenia stage, is extremely beneficial. Methods: For this purpose, this paper presents a non-invasive computer aided diagnosis system for disease's screening using knee X-ray scans in its two basic stages (i.e., Osteopenia and Osteoporosis). Furthermore, a probabilistic diagnosis is produced for each scan, offering a personalized diagnosis that in turn indicates the severity of the disease, if exist, for each individual independently. Accordingly, the proposed methodology consists of three main steps: (1) the X-ray scans of three groups (i.e., normal, Osteopenia, and Osteoporosis) are pre-processed to improve the scans’ quality, and to serve the feature extraction and the construction of the model; (2) the pre-trained VGG16 model is used to identify the descriminative characteristics of each studied group that are then; at stage (3) fed to the SVM classifier to accomplish the diagnosis task, including the severity grading task. Results: Evaluating the proposed framework showed promising results with an average overall accuracy of 94.85%. In the groups base, the results were around 93.75%, 96.77%, and 100% for the normal group's recall, F1-score, and precision, respectively. For the Osteopenia group, the results were around 93.95%, 100%, and 88.60% for F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively. Finally, the Osteoporosis group's results achieved an average of 93.91%, 90%, and 98% for F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively. Conclusion: These results reflect the powerful ability of the proposed work especially that it could outperform the related efforts. Accordingly, these results encourage further analysis to extract more related medical insights for consequent assistance in the relevant healthcare diagnosis and treatment plans. © 2025 The Authors","El-Sisi, Hadeel Osama Information Technology Dept., Faculty of Computers and Information, Mansoura University, Dakahlia, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt","El-Sisi, Hadeel Osama and El-Gamal, Fatma El-Zahraa Ahmed and Hikal, Noha Ahmed",10.1016/j.eij.2025.100634,UNKNOWN,11108665,Egyptian Informatics Journal,2025,False
Novice risk work: How juniors coaching seniors on emerging technologies such as generative AI can lead to learning failures,"Historically, junior professionals have mentored senior professionals around new technologies, because juniors are typically more willing than seniors to perform lower-level tasks to learn new skills, better able than seniors to engage in real-time experimentation close to the work itself, and more willing than seniors to learn innovative methods that conflict with traditional identities and norms. However, we know little about what happens when emerging technologies have a high level of uncertainty in their use, because they have wide-ranging capabilities and are exponentially changing. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, specifically learning algorithms and LLMs, such contexts may be increasingly common. In our study conducted with the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we interviewed 78 junior consultants in July–August 2023 who had recently participated in a field experiment that gave them access for the first time to generative AI (GPT-4) for a strategic business problem solving task. Drawing from junior professionals' in situ reflections soon after the experiment, we found that junior professionals may fail to manage risks around uncertain emerging technologies because juniors are likely to recommend three kinds of novice risk work tactics that: 1) are grounded in a lack of deep understanding of technologies that have uncertain and wide-ranging capabilities and are changing exponentially, 2) focus on change to human routines rather than system design, and 3) focus on interventions at the project-level rather than system deployer- or ecosystem-level. The implications of novice risk work are that, when junior professionals are expected to be a source of expertise in the use of uncertain, emerging technologies, this can lead to learning failures. This study contributes to our understanding of occupational learning around emerging technologies, risk work in organizations, and human-computer interaction. © 2025","Kellogg, Katherine C.

A FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS SAFETY TRAINING USING FLIPPED LEARNING,"Effective safety training plays an important part in safety management on construction sites. Construction workers safety and safety training education remain to be the main issues in the construction industry, as current practices rely on traditional methods. These methods often lack classroom interaction, hindering active worker engagement and fail to accommodate diverse learning paces and styles. To enhance safety awareness among workers, there is a need for a more effective system for safety training programs within the construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively analyse an experimental intervention using flipped learning to reduce costs and enhance learning outcomes in construction safety training. Flipped learning transforms traditional classroom learning by introducing students to web-based videos, presentations, and readings before class, freeing up in-class time for discussions and problem-solving. An intervention study was carried out to confirm the effectiveness of flipped learning approach within the construction industry. In this study, 40 personnel from a leading construction firm in Pakistan underwent safety training, with 20 following the traditional method and the remaining 20 following the proposed flipped model. The final quiz revealed a score increase from 27.9 to 31.5 in flipped learning, indicating a 12.90% increase. Based on these findings, it is suggested that adopting the flipped learning approach leads to better learning outcomes within the construction industry, as workers can pause, rewind, and replay the lectures at their leisure. This not only makes safety training more accessible but also enhances on-site safety in a cost-effective manner. © 2025 The Author(s).","Rehman, Abdul School of Civil & Environmental Engineering, NUST Institute of Civil Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan; Hassan, Muhammad Usman Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia","Rehman, Abdul and Hassan, Muhammad Usman and Zubair, Muhammad Umer and Aziz, Taha and Ahmed, Khursheed",10.3846/jcem.2025.23083,UNKNOWN,13923730,Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,2025,False

Environmental policy-driven electricity consumption prediction: A novel buffer-corrected Hausdorff fractional grey model informed by two-stage enhanced multi-objective optimization,"In the global quest for carbon neutrality, electricity is a critical sector for carbon reduction, for electricity consumption and carbon emissions are closely associated. Electricity consumption forecasts are divided into short-term and long-term, but previous studies have focused more on the former, while the latter is the foundation of power system planning and directly relates to urban development. To address the issue, this research proposed an innovative hybrid Hausdorff fractional grey model (HfGM) for electricity consumption prediction, weakening buffer operator (WBo) was incorporated to minimize interference of external shocks to original data, the optimal core parameters of HfGM were searched by a newly developed multi-objective enhanced version of slime mould algorithm in two stages, achieving Pareto optimal solutions theoretically. Experiments results demonstrated the proposed model outperformed comparative models, leading to its application in predicting electricity consumption trends in China during the 15th Five-Year Plan period and assessing the corresponding environmental impacts. Beyond advancing grey model theory, the research provides essential policy recommendations for integrating environmental management into electricity demand planning, assisting policymakers in addressing demand growth and supporting carbon reduction goals. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Qian, Yuansheng Department of Engineering Science, Faculty of Innovation Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, 999078, China; Zhu, Zhijie School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, NO.217 Jianshan Street, Shahekou District, Liaoning, Dalian, 116025, China; Niu, Xinsong Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China","Qian, Yuansheng and Zhu, Zhijie and Niu, Xinsong and Zhang, Linyue and Wang, Kang and Wang, Jianzhou",10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124540,UNKNOWN,03014797,Journal of Environmental Management,2025,False

"Enhanced Traffic Sign Management System using CNNs Based on Voice Interaction, and Live Visual Feedback","Traffic sign management is vital for road safety and efficiency. Existing approaches primarily focus on detecting a limited number of traffic sign categories, leaving a gap in managing the extensive inventory of signs. This project introduces a novel approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and recognize 43 traffic sign categories, significantly expanding the scope of automated traffic sign inventory management. Moreover, the system integrates voice interaction, allowing users to verbally engage with the system, and employs text-to-speech for conveying information. Additionally, it incorporates a live camera feed, displaying real-time video alongside detected signs, ensuring immediate recognition and providing live visual feedback. Furthermore, the system triggers alerts and warnings for critical signs, enhancing user interaction and road safety measures. The proposed system represents an innovative amalgamation of advanced computer vision techniques, voice interaction, and live visual feedback, presenting a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for effective traffic sign management. The system's robustness and accuracy pave the way for practical deployment, significantly reducing manual efforts in traffic sign inventory management while ensuring road safety. © 2025 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Carbon Emission Reduction in Traffic Control: A Signal Timing Optimization Method Based on Rainbow DQN,"To improve intersection traffic flow and reduce vehicle energy consumption and emissions at intersections, a signal optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. The algorithm uses Rainbow DQN as the core framework, incorporating vehicle position, speed, and acceleration information into the state space. The reward function simultaneously considers two objectives: reducing vehicle waiting times and minimizing carbon emissions, with the vehicle queue length as a weighted factor. Additionally, an ACmix module, which integrates self-attention mechanisms and convolutional layers, is introduced to enhance the model’s feature extraction and information representation capabilities, improving computational efficiency. The model is tested using an actual intersection as the study object, with a signal intersection simulation built in SUMO. The proposed approach is compared with traditional Webster signal timing, actuated signal timing, and control strategies based on DQN and D3QN models. The results show that the proposed strategy, through real-time signal timing adjustments, reduces the average vehicle waiting time by approximately 27.58% and the average CO2 emissions by about 7.34% compared with the actuated signal timing method. A comparison with DQN and D3QN models further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model, achieving a 15% reduction in average waiting time and a 6.5% reduction in CO2 emissions. The model’s applicability is validated under various scenarios, including different proportions of electric vehicles and traffic volumes. This study aims to provide a flexible signal control strategy to enhance intersection vehicle flow and reduce carbon emissions. It offers a reference for the development of green, intelligent transportation systems and holds practical significance for promoting urban carbon reduction efforts. © 2025 by the authors.","Lv, Juan College of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, 210037, China","Lv, Juan and Wang, Zhaowei and Ma, Jianxiao",10.3390/app15031101,UNKNOWN,20763417,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2025,False
Sustainability of a digital health intervention within Pakistan’s remote health system: learning from implementation research,"Pakistan faces significant challenges in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals for maternal and child health by the 2030 target. Separate vertical programmes, governance challenges due to paper-based systems, and limited availability of data contribute to the health system’s suboptimal functioning. An innovative mHealth tool, Hayat, was introduced in remote areas of Pakistan to digitalise record-keeping by frontline workers, provide evidence-based awareness content for dissemination, and track performance through transparency enhanced by geographical information system tracking. There has been a limited translation of mHealth evidence into policy change globally. Hayat is one of the few donor-funded programmes, and strengthens the health system in Pakistan. It secured matching funding from the government to sustain operations and for scale-up. The current paper was planned to describe the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that led to the intervention’s adoption by the government, including the technological and programmatic approaches, challenges and mitigation strategies, and policy recommendations for the long-term sustainability of similar mHealth interventions in low- and middle-income countries. © 2025 Pakistan Medical Association.

Mfe-net: a multiscale feature enhanced network for mesoscale convective systems identification,"Accurate identification of Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is important for disaster prevention and management. Traditional MCSs identification methods are based on temperature and area thresholds. These methods are highly accurate for MCSs identification, but consume large computational resources. Deep learning models have made significant progress in the field of object identification. However, existing deep learning models do not take into account the characteristics of excessive differences in MCSs area coverage and uneven spatial distribution. Direct application of these models to this task may lead to the problems of missed identification of small MCSs and ambiguous identification of MCSS boundaries. In this paper, we construct a MCSs recognition dataset and propose a Multiscale Feature Enhancement Network (MFE-Net) for identifying MCSs. This model consists of two main modules: Feature Alignment Distribution Module (FADM) and Asymmetric Feature Recovery Module (AFRM). The FADM, which is used to aggregate multiscale information during the downsampling phase, aims to improve the perception of small-scale MCSs and prevent them from being lost during the downsampling process of the model. AFRM is designed to extract and preserve spatial edge features of MCSs from different spatial dimensions and accurately identify the edges of MCSs. The experimental results show that our MFE-Net achieves excellent performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Li, Peng Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, 610225, China; Huang, Zhanao Chongqing Cigarette Industry Company Ltd., Chongqing, 400060, China","Li, Peng and Huang, Zhanao and Li, Yan and Kou, Yi and Li, Xiaojie",10.1007/s11227-025-07065-5,UNKNOWN,09208542,Journal of Supercomputing,2025,False
Using interpersonal meaning making resources to build relationships and improve engagement in online teacher professional learning,"As professional learning and development (PLD) for teachers moves online, it is increasingly important to consider what constitutes effective provision. While models of effective PLD abound, online PLD faces challenges to participant engagement. In particular, the critical need to build and maintain relationships in professional learning is complicated by the geographic and temporal distribution of online participants as well as the nuances of the technology in use. We argue that online PLD occurs in collaborative text-spaces within learning management systems, social media spaces and their attendant learning objects such as forums. As such, persistent challenges to engagement in online PLD may be met by considering the language-based interpersonal affordances of these text-spaces. We employ a small-scale corpus study and appraisal analysis to demonstrate the value of Systemic Functional Linguistics in addressing the challenges of online learning, particularly how the meaning making resources of the interpersonal metafunction can be used to improve participant engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.","Adlington, Rachael School of Education, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia","Adlington, Rachael and Quinn, Frances and Charteris, Jennifer and Rizk, Nadya and Volpe, Catherine Rita",10.1007/s13384-024-00713-4,UNKNOWN,03116999,Australian Educational Researcher,2025,False

Enhancing data-driven energy management strategy via digital expert guidance for electrified vehicles,"This study addresses data efficiency and reliability issues in reinforcement learning (RL)-based energy management strategies (EMS) for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). A novel expert-guided RL (EGRL) paradigm is proposed, combining deep ensemble methods with a digital expert model (DEM) for real-time EMS intervention across various scenarios. DEM, trained via domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), adapts to different driving conditions. An intervention mechanism, based on uncertainty evaluation in the deep ensemble, allows DEM to guide and supervise RL training, ensuring reliability. The EMS optimizes energy consumption, battery health, and electricity maintenance for the range-extended electric bus (REEB) system. Simulation results show the paradigm significantly improves energy management, nearing optimal performance and surpassing traditional RL methods. EGRL achieves an average 15.8% improvement in economic benefit across all test cycles. This research offers an innovative solution for EMS and has broad potential for other automation applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Hu, Dong Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; Huang, Chao Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; Wu, Jingda School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; Wei, Henglai School of Mechanical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Hu, Dong and Huang, Chao and Wu, Jingda and Wei, Henglai and Pi, Dawei",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125138,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False
Cities and Governance for Net-Zero: Assessing Procedures and Tools for Innovative Design of Urban Climate Governance in Europe,"Despite the collective promise of integrating more open (broader-based, participatory) city-level governance into the global energy governance regime, little attention has been paid to the different impact logics and assumptions underpinning local procedural governance tools (PGTs) in circulation and the degree to which they address key good governance dimensions dominantly thought to be indicative of transformation. This review aims to fill this gap by mapping and analyzing key energy transition PGTs circulating across four climate action initiatives that mobilize and provide support to cities and local governments. A framework—REPAIR: Reflexivity, Enabling/Embedding, Participatory, Integrative, Adaptive, and Radicality—is proposed based on a synthesis of common governance innovation design features, and a representative sample of 25 PGTs are evaluated against these dimensions. The analysis reveals a need for (1) more differentiation and tailored capacity relating to governance monitoring, evaluating, and learning systems; (2) more attention to prioritization and design factors across different governance interventions in relation to local climate actions; and (3) more nuanced theories of change for operationalizing local power/coalition/mandate building (across different dimensions of governance). This article concludes that there are real gaps in how the collective advantages, opportunities, and promise of traveling “ideal types” of good governance will be fulfilled and outlines future research directions for informing more aligned governance innovation for low-carbon transitions in urban areas. © 2025 by the authors.","Terwilliger, Joel Centre for Environment and Sustainability, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom; Christie, Ian Institute for Sustainable Futures, De Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, United Kingdom","Terwilliger, Joel and Christie, Ian",10.3390/su17062698,UNKNOWN,20711050,Sustainability (Switzerland),2025,False

Improving colonoscopy quality in the national VA healthcare system,"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is a Veterans Affairs (VA) priority. Colonoscopy quality, especially adenoma detection rate (ADR), is critical for effective screening. Our research indicates considerable variation in ADR among VA providers. Even a slight increase in ADR can reduce fatal CRC rates, and audit and feedback strategies have improved ADR in other settings. A recent report identified deficiencies in VA colonoscopy quality, highlighting the need for standardized documentation and reporting. To address this, we developed the VA Endoscopy Quality Improvement Program (VA-EQuIP), which aims to improve colonoscopy quality through benchmarking and collaborative learning, aligning with VA's modernization priorities and HSR&D and QUERI goals of accelerating evidence-based implementation. Methods: We will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate whether VA-EQuIP improves provider ADR compared to usual care, the implementation of VA-EQuIP, site-level factors associated with colonoscopy quality improvement, and components of provider behavior change. Using mixed methods our study will measure outcomes like reach, implementation, adoption, maintenance of VA-EQuIP, and provider behavior change. The analysis will include primary and secondary outcomes, such as overall and screening ADR, cecal intubation rate, and bowel preparation quality, using mixed effects generalized linear models and interrupted time-series analyses. Adoption and implementation will be evaluated through usage statistics, surveys, and qualitative interviews to identify factors influencing success. Discussion: This study will assess the impact of VA-EQuIP on colonoscopy quality metrics and factors associated with effective implementation. VA-EQuIP infrastructure allows for national-scale implementation and evaluation of quality reporting with minimal manual labor, guiding future quality improvement efforts to ensure optimal patient care. © 2024","Gawron, Andrew J.

Assessing the relationship between feedback strategies and learning improvement from a distance learning perspective,"Purpose: Feedback is crucial in a learning process, particularly in an online interaction where both learners and instructors are distantly located. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the association between feedback strategies, embedded course syllabus and learning improvement in the Sakai Learning Management System. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a survey design to collect cross-sectional data from adult distance learning students. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a standard multiple regression model in Stata. Findings: The results show that feedback strategies (timing, mode, quality and quantity) and embedded course syllabus have a significant relationship with learning improvement. However, the feedback strategy – target – is not significantly related to learning improvement though it is the highest feedback strategy. Originality/value: This paper has contributed to the extant literature by providing empirical evidence to support the constructivism theory of learning from a distance learning perspective in a developing country. The study has shown that if the feedback strategies are well managed and applied, they would make a considerable impact on distance education students' academic pursuits.

"Designing, implementing and evaluating multidisciplinary healthcare training programmes in the wartime humanitarian context of Ukraine","Introduction Civilian healthcare workers (HCW) and medical facilities are directly and indirectly impacted by armed conflict. In the Russia-Ukraine war, acute trauma care needs grew, the workforce was destabilised by HCW migrating or shifting roles to meet conflict needs, and facilities faced surge events. Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) exposure risks created unique preparedness needs. In response, an academic and international non-governmental organisation partnership was formed to design, implement and evaluate a locally prioritised training programme in Ukraine. Methods Seven in-person training courses (Advanced Trauma Life Support, Trauma Nursing Fundamentals, Pediatric Trauma Fundamentals, Prehospital Trauma Fundamentals, Stop the Bleed, Mass Casualty Management and CBRNE Preparedness) were adapted, translated, taught and evaluated in seven Ukrainian oblasts (regions; Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Lviv, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv) during the war. Topics were determined by available needs assessments and further adapted based on course participant feedback and evolving logistic and security challenges. Change in participant knowledge and confidence levels was assessed through precourse and postcourse knowledge and self-confidence evaluations and follow-up surveys. Initial courses were taught by international instructors and transitioned to Ukrainian instructors as they were trained. Web-based asynchronous videos in Ukrainian were developed to complement and reinforce in-person training. Results 4368 participants were trained in 164 courses from August 2022 to April 2023. 223 instructors were trained. Aggregate participant knowledge and self-confidence significantly improved in all courses. Interval follow-up responses indicated that the training was useful and 83.3% had used the skills within 8 weeks of training. Twenty-seven training videos were created which, as of April 2023, have been viewed over 1 700 000 times in 500 cities throughout Ukraine. Conclusions Locally prioritised training can be rapidly developed and delivered in an armed conflict setting providing civilians and frontline HCW with the skills and knowledge required to care for patients.

Final-year nursing students' placement experiences in a critical care setting: A qualitative study,"Background: Traditionally, ward placements have been utilized for nursing students to refine their management skills before registration. Whilst intensive care units (ICUs) offer unique learning opportunities, they are underutilized for student practice, and limited research has examined ICUs as conducive environments for developing management skills. Aim: This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of nursing students during their final-year placement in critical care. Study Design: An inductive methodology was employed to explore the complexities of being a final-year nursing student in critical care setting. Ten students were recruited between September 2019 and February 2020. Data were collected using individual, face-to-face semi-structured interviews before the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data. Results: Three themes were identified: barriers to learning, empowering transformation and a state of readiness. All the nursing students valued a placement that provided ‘real learning’ experiences and informed their needs and growth. Coaching and constructive feedback provided crucial markers and influenced students' learning performance. As their confidence increased, students became proactive in identifying complex caring activities to test and refine their knowledge and skills. Students visualized themselves working as a registered nurse within the critical care team. Conclusions: With appropriate support and supervision, a critical care placement for final-year nursing students is a stimulating and transformational experience. Relevance to Clinical Practice: This study highlights the importance of critical care placements for nursing students, aiding their transition to professional practice. Integrating well-supported placements into nursing curricula enhances decision-making abilities and readiness for future roles. Critical care nurse educators and managers should focus on developing effective support systems during these placements. By providing tailored support and preparing students for the demands of critical care, these experiences can improve job satisfaction and confidence, which are crucial for staff recruitment and retention in this challenging field. © 2025 The Author(s).

Improving real-time detection of laryngeal lesions in endoscopic images using a decoupled super-resolution enhanced YOLO,"Background and Objective: Laryngeal Cancer (LC) constitutes approximately one third of head and neck cancers. Detecting early-stage lesions in this anatomical region is crucial for achieving a high survival rate. However, it poses significant diagnostic challenges owing to the varied appearance of lesions and the need for precise characterization for appropriate clinical management. Conventional diagnostic approaches rely heavily on endoscopic examination, which often requires expert interpretation and may be limited by subjective assessment. Deep learning (DL) approaches offer promising opportunities for automating lesion detection, but their efficacy in handling multi-modal imaging data and accurately localizing small lesions remains a subject of investigation. Furthermore, the clinical domain may largely benefit from the deployment of efficient DL methods that can ensure equitable access to advanced technologies, regardless of the availability of resources that can often be limited. In this study, a DL-based approach, named SRE-YOLO, was introduced to provide real-time assistance to less-experienced personnel during laryngeal assessment, by automatically detecting lesions at different scales from endoscopic White Light (WL) and Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) images. Methods: During the training, the SRE-YOLO integrates a YOLOv8 nano (YOLOv8n) baseline with a Super-Resolution (SR) branch to enhance lesion detection. This last component is decoupled during inference to preserve the low computational demand of the YOLOv8n baseline. The evaluation was conducted on a multi-center dataset, encompassing diverse laryngeal pathologies and acquisition modalities. Results: The SRE-YOLO method improved the Average Precision (AP @IoU","Baldini, Chiara Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy; Migliorelli, Lucia Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering, University of Genoa, Genova, Italy; Berardini, Daniele Department of Information Engineering, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy; Azam, Muhammad Adeel Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES), University of Genoa, Genova, Italy; Sampieri, Claudio Department of Otolaryngology, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain; Ioppi, Alessandro Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, S.

"Leveraging artificial intelligence to reduce diagnostic errors in emergency medicine: Challenges, opportunities, and future directions","Diagnostic errors in health care pose significant risks to patient safety and are disturbingly common. In the emergency department (ED), the chaotic and high-pressure environment increases the likelihood of these errors, as emergency clinicians must make rapid decisions with limited information, often under cognitive overload. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to improve diagnostic errors in three key areas: information gathering, clinical decision support (CDS), and feedback through quality improvement. AI can streamline the information-gathering process by automating data retrieval, reducing cognitive load, and providing clinicians with essential patient details quickly. AI-driven CDS systems enhance diagnostic decision making by offering real-time insights, reducing cognitive biases, and prioritizing differential diagnoses. Furthermore, AI-powered feedback loops can facilitate continuous learning and refinement of diagnostic processes by providing targeted education and outcome feedback to clinicians. By integrating AI into these areas, the potential for reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient safety in the ED is substantial. However, successfully implementing AI in the ED is challenging and complex. Developing, validating, and implementing AI as a safe, human-centered ED tool requires thoughtful design and meticulous attention to ethical and practical considerations. Clinicians and patients must be integrated as key stakeholders across these processes. Ultimately, AI should be seen as a tool that assists clinicians by supporting better, faster decisions and thus enhances patient outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Unlocking the potential of technology usage in fostering education quality and students' satisfaction: a case of Pakistani higher education,"Purpose: This research aims to determine the levels of education quality (EQ), technology usage (TU), students' satisfaction (SS) and the impact of EQ on SS. Also, it seeks to find out how TU as a moderator affects EQ and SS in Pakistani private higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 440 postgraduate students at eleven private universities in Lahore, Punjab Province, Pakistan, participated in empirical research and data were obtained through the use of an online questionnaire. Simple random sampling was used to choose participants and partial least square structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. Findings: The findings revealed that Pakistani private HEIs have a medium level of EQ, TU and SS. Furthermore, the data reveal the existence of a significant positive relationship between EQ and SS, whereas TU as a moderator was found to negatively affect EQ and SS. Research limitations/implications: Postgraduate students of private HEIs in Pakistan were considered for this investigation and this study was limited to testing only in Punjab province. Another limitation of this study is that it was based on a research framework from previous research and literature. This study employed questionnaire surveys to conduct evaluations of teachers' teaching quality by university students. Furthermore, the questionnaire employed student self-evaluations to assess the quality of teaching. The research data would be more detailed if it were possible to include teachers' self-evaluations of their teaching quality. Practical implications: The current study provides key insights for policymakers, higher education commission and HEIs. The results suggest leveraging the identified medium levels of EQ, TU and student satisfaction in Pakistani private HEIs. In an effort to boost the medium levels, policymakers are encouraged to enhance the teaching and learning experience by robustly integrating Web 4.0 technologies. Institutions can intervene strategically by investing in infrastructure and innovative tools aligned with students' technological needs. Likewise, policymakers and institutions can optimize learning management systems (LMS) by developing and implementing policies that encourage their adoption and optimization across HEIs. This may contribute to the accomplishment of the United Nations' sustainable development goal of providing quality education. Moreover, with the help of this research HEIs can establish minimum quality standards regarding academic teaching and learning materials. Implementing the above-mentioned practical implications might boost student satisfaction in HEIs which would benefit not only students but also the institutions. Originality/value: The novelty of the article lies in the fact that it addresses the gap in the existing literature by exploring the levels of EQ, TU and student satisfaction in the context of private higher education in Pakistan. Furthermore, this study investigated whether TU served as a moderator in the relationship between student satisfaction and UNESCO-recommended EQ. This study elaborates on EQ indicators recommended by UNESCO in Pakistan’s private higher education sector. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ikram, Maryam Department of Educational Management, Planning and Policy, Faculty of Education, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Kenayathulla, Husaina Banu School of Technology Management and Logistics, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Sintok, Malaysia","Ikram, Maryam and Kenayathulla, Husaina Banu and Saleem, Syed Muhammad Umer",10.1108/K-03-2023-0452,UNKNOWN,0368492X,Kybernetes,2025,False
Unsupervised disaggregation of aggregated net load considering behind-the-meter PV based on virtual PV sample construction,"Most of the distributed photovoltaics (PV) are installed behind the meter (BTM), single-meter deployments permit distribution system operators to monitor only the net load and exclude the BTM PV generation, so the growing prevalence of BTM PV installations negatively affects distribution system planning and the local balance of supply and demand. However, existing methods for net load disaggregation mainly rely on the installation of expensive monitoring devices and high-resolution sensors, and face challenges such as privacy concerns, data diversity, and communication barriers. In this paper, an unsupervised method for aggregated net load disaggregation is proposed that achieves accurate separation of BTM PV outputs and actual loads using only net load data and exogenous variables. First, a data-driven method is developed to construct the actual load sample matrix of customers. Then, a virtual PV sample construction method based on the self-feedback decoupling algorithm (SFDA) is proposed to tackle the invisibility of BTM PV resources. The method performs self-feedback learning and constructs the virtual PV samples by minimizing the long-term decomposition residuals, and generates the virtual PV sample matrix. Finally, the model learning results are employed to achieve net load disaggregation through the contextually supervised source separation (CSSS) algorithm. The study utilized real open-source data whereby analyses reveal the method greatly enhances the decoupling accuracy of unsupervised algorithms. Furthermore, it eliminates a series of problems associated with traditional supervised algorithms and expands the scope of unsupervised decoupling methods. © 2024","Qu, Ziyu Department of Electrical Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, 071003, China; Ge, Xinxin State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, 102206, China; Lu, Jinling Hebei Key Laboratory of Distributed Energy Storage and Microgrid, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, 071003, China","Qu, Ziyu and Ge, Xinxin and Lu, Jinling and Wang, Fei",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.125007,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False
A digital twin of multiple energy hub systems with peer-to-peer energy sharing,"As climate change has become a global concern, the decarbonization of energy systems has become a prominent solution for CO2 emission reduction. The recent emergence of multi-energy hub systems (MEHs), characterized by interconnected energy hubs (EHs) and facilitated by energy sharing, presents a promising solution for seamlessly integrating a significant share of renewable energy sources (RESs) and flexibility among EHs. Faced with the intricate interplay and uncertainty of future energy markets, an extensive digital twin (EXDT) is proposed to perform predictive testing and evaluate the performance of MESs. This EXDT provides energy system operators with insights into the coordinated behavior of interconnected EHs under various future scenarios, thus contributing to smarter decision-making processes. Specifically, an array of scenarios including different decision-making strategies and P2P energy sharing strategies were considered. For each of these scenarios,""what-if"" tests were conducted using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based method to model the stochastic decision-making process of EHs belonging to different stakeholders with access to local information. Uncertainties during operation can be mitigated using Markov Game (MG) by capturing knowledge from historical energy data. Subsequently, the economic and technical performance were evaluated using multidimensional evaluation indexes. The proposed MARL-based EXDT was applied to a representative 4-EH multi-energy system in China. Simulation results indicate that P2P energy sharing facilitates the local consumption of renewable energy, providing additional financial benefits and self-sufficiency to each EH and offering peak shaving to the upstream grid. Additionally, system performance under various decision-making and P2P sharing strategies was tested and evaluated to identify the impact of these strategies on system operation. © 2024","Li, Shiyao School of Mechanical Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Zhou, Yue School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom; Wu, Jianzhong School of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Pan, Yiqun Sino-German College of Applied Sciences, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; Huang, Zhizhong Energy Technologies Area, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States","Li, Shiyao and Zhou, Yue and Wu, Jianzhong and Pan, Yiqun and Huang, Zhizhong and Zhou, Nan",10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124908,UNKNOWN,03062619,Applied Energy,2025,False

However, the lack of physical properties and the varied operating conditions in real-world use further increase the difficulty of traditional SOH estimation, making it a significant challenge in current research. For this reason, this paper proposes a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) method for accurate SOH estimation of LIBs varied operating conditions. Considering the fully charged relaxation voltage data obtained easily in practical applications, firstly, this paper discussed the relaxation voltage data related to the battery's aging characteristics from the experimental tests. Secondly, the fractional-order equivalent circuit model (FOECM) is constructed and parameters characterizing battery degradation are identified for extracting the physical features. Ultimately, a novel PIML framework based FOECM of LIB is developed, then the datasets of three different battery types under different temperatures and discharge rates are used and validated for SOH estimation without considering any usage information. Experimental results show that the PIML method proposed in this paper can quickly achieve SOH estimation and keep the accuracy in 0.84 % for different types of batteries under varying experimental conditions. In addition, compared with other feature extraction methods, the PIML-based SOH estimation has obvious advantages with 16.2 %, which provides an important reference for the design and optimization of advanced battery management systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Lin, Chunsong School of Information Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, 621010, China; Tuo, Xianguo College of Mechanical Engineering, Anhui Science and Technology University, Chuzhou, 233100, China; Wu, Longxing School of Mechanical Engineering, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Yibin, 64400, China; Zhang, Guiyu School of Internet, Anhui University, Anhui, Hefei, 230039, China","Lin, Chunsong and Tuo, Xianguo and Wu, Longxing and Zhang, Guiyu and Lyu, Zhiqiang and Zeng, Xiangling",10.1016/j.energy.2025.134937,UNKNOWN,03605442,Energy,2025,False

Bayesian optimized ensemble learning system for predicting conceptual cost and construction duration of irrigation improvement systems,"Linear construction projects, such as pipeline irrigation projects, are prone to delays and cost overruns owing to inaccurate cost and duration estimates. The research gap pertains to studies that concentrated exclusively on predicting costs or durations using backbox artificial intelligence models. Consequently, this study introduces an innovative approach that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence to forecast the conceptual cost and duration of irrigation projects simultaneously. This study analyzed data from 1,277 historical cases using factor analysis and stepwise regression to distill 25 parameters down to five key drivers. It evaluates 12 machine learning models, including multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and decision tree-based ensemble methods. Bayesian optimization was employed to fine-tune the performance of each algorithm. The light gradient boosting machine is identified as the most effective algorithm for cost prediction, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.989 % and an Adjusted Determination Coefficient (R⁎2) of 0.931. For duration prediction, the extremely randomized tree model stands out, achieving a MAPE of 2.533 % and an R⁎2 of 0.961.

Dynamic proactive–reactive scheduling for URLLC in 5G: Leveraging XGBoost and network virtualization,"In this paper, we focus on service coexistence within the 5G network. Specifically, we aim to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) for Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) within 5G networks. We propose a smart scheduler by integrating machine learning models. Real-time channel reports are used to make data-driven decisions based on current network conditions, thereby centralizing scheduling tasks to streamline operations and enhance adaptability. The key contributions include the development of an adaptive scheduling strategy that dynamically switches between reactive and proactive approaches, ensuring optimal balance between low latency and ultra-reliability for URLLC services. Additionally, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is applied to accurately predict URLLC traffic delays, assuring effective prioritization and timely delivery of time-sensitive services. Furthermore, the proposed solution combines network virtualization and machine learning techniques to address security risks and potential service interruptions linked to reactive scheduling policies. The proposed approach enhances existing methods by improving network virtualization features, which are integrated with machine learning models, specifically XGBoost to optimize the scheduling of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Unlike previous work, our proposal uses network virtualization to enable a dynamic combination of proactive and reactive scheduling strategies that can be adapted in real-time. Network virtualization features provide centralized control and resource management, resulting in reduced complexity and more efficient resource allocation. This helps the scheduler react quickly to changing network conditions, ensuring low latency and high reliability of URLLC services. In addition, network virtualization enhances the security level by isolating different types of traffic and mitigating risks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and impersonation attacks. Subsequently, the integration of advanced network virtualization functions with machine-learning predictions not only optimizes planning but also enhances security and resource management. The proposed system is evaluated through simulations, demonstrating robust performance with low latency and high reliability for URLLC services. The XGBoost model achieves impressive results with low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on both validation and holdout datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Hendaoui, Saloua Department of Computer Science, Jouf University, Jouf, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia; Hendaoui, Fatma Department of Computer Science, Applied College, University of Ha'il, Saudi Arabia; Zangar, Nawel University Gustave-Eiffel, LIGM-CNRS UMR 8049, ESIEE Paris, France","Hendaoui, Saloua and Hendaoui, Fatma and Zangar, Nawel",10.1016/j.phycom.2024.102553,UNKNOWN,18744907,Physical Communication,2025,False
Agent-Based Modeling as a Tool for Ecological Comanagement of Grazing Lands,"Rangeland management necessitates addressing complex and dynamic social-ecological challenges and opportunities at scales appropriate to target landscapes. We combine geospatial and climate data in an agent-based system dynamics model to simulate temporally and spatially scalable rangeland human-environment-animal-forage relationships. Modeling highly variable grazing system elements requires both adaptability and mathematical realism. Agent-based modeling makes it possible to test alternative approaches to real-world scenarios without taking risks associated with actual experimentation on working operations. Our agent-based model, Ecological Comanagement of Rangelands, or ECo-Range, allows managers to simulate cattle grazing scenarios by setting environmental conditions and management decisions that affect simulation outcomes. In this sense, ECo-Range is not just a product of scientific inquiry, but a tool to be used for collaborative discovery, as it illuminates relationships among environmental conditions, management decisions, and ecological and livestock outcomes for modeled landscapes. ECo-Range explores the complexities of grazing management, embracing rather than excluding variability and heterogeneity inherent in rangeland social-ecological systems. We first present ECo-Range, explaining the model's relevance to the fields of simulation modeling and rangeland management. We then present a case study on the Colorado Front Range as proof of concept to test the utility, validity, and applicability of ECo-Range as a learning tool to explore scenarios related to government-owned landscapes that necessitate comanagement approaches to cattle grazing. © 2025 The Author(s)","Monlezun, Anna Clare Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, 80523, CO, United States; Boone, Randall B.

Home video review in a pediatric clinical neurophysiology led multidisciplinary team meeting,"Objective: Assessment of the value of review of home videos by a pediatric multidisciplinary team (MDT) in a pediatric neurophysiology department. Methods: We describe and evaluate the review of home videos alongside clinical history and previous investigations from patients referred to the Evelina pediatric EEG department at a twice-monthly MDT meeting between 01/2021 and 09/2022. We retrospectively analyzed measures of video quality, quantity and duration, time taken from referral to MDT meeting, pre-MDT and post-MDT meeting proposed diagnosis and clinical outcomes. Feedback from referring doctors was obtained by a survey. Results: There were 36 referrals for 34 patients totalling 123 videos. There was a median delay of 10 days between video upload and final report. After the MDT meeting the number of referrals classified as uncertain fell from 15 to 2. The number of referrals classified as non-epileptic events increased from seven to 18. The number classified as infantile spasms fell from six to two. Overall, 26 of 36 referrals had a change in diagnosis and 26 of 36 referrals were triaged away from the video-EEG telemetry (VT) waiting list. Nine out of ten referring doctors reported that MDT discussion improved their understanding of the events. Significance: HVR is a useful tool that has been successfully incorporated into our neurophysiology department's workflow. These early results suggest benefits from adopting an MDT meeting may include an early diagnosis and management approach based upon consensus. Using HVR in a pediatric population may help triage urgent cases, conserve specialized neurophysiological investigations and streamline workflows to improve the efficiency of pediatric referrals. © 2024 The Author(s).

Explore the Prediction of Formative Assessment to Academic Success in Blended Learning: A Case Study,"The objective of this study is to predict students' final achievement based on their ongoing engagement and formative assessment results within learning management systems (LMSs). This study incorporates ongoing assessment performance as a key factor in measuring student engagement and predicting final exam performance. The results indicate that in the blended teaching process, firstly, including ongoing engagement activities in the final assessment has a positive effect on final exam scores. Secondly, the predictive effect of multiple continuous tasks is superior to that of a single continuous task, and ongoing engagement activities are better predictors of final exam scores than formative assessments. Thirdly, using a standard level as a reference for prediction yields relatively high accuracy, while using an average level as a reference can better identify at-risk students.
