This paper further delves into the development and implementation of AI-aided tutoring systems for the purpose of boosting increased engagement to enhance learning in the elementary school set-ups. This study will concentrate on how technology can be applied to the learning environment to meet the needs of young learners in as much diverse ways as possible, apart from trying to understand various impacts that the use of AI in education can bring about. Central to the problem in this study was the nature of varying learning profiles found in elementary classrooms. General, traditional one-size-fits-all methods normally have difficulties responding well to the individual needs of students and, in doing so, often result in the differences in the levels of engagements and achievements of students. This means that therefore, dynamic learning experiences can be created using the artificial intelligence technology to cater for the unique strengths, weaknesses, and preferences of each student. AI-assisted tutoring systems have the potential to help provide targeted support, hence leading to a sense of engagement and mastery. Time-oriented feedback and adaptive scaffolding are most important for the success of AI-assisted tutoring systems. In so doing, such systems can dynamically adapt difficulty levels and content delivery to make the best use of learning trajectories by constantly assessing a student’s progress and performance.","","979-8-3503-6810-9","10.1109/ICICAT62666.2024.10923307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10923307","AI-Assisted Tutoring Systems;Elementary Education;Engagement;Learning Outcomes;Artificial Intelligence;Pedagogical Practices;Personalized Learning;Adaptive Feedback;Socio-Emotional Support;Qualitative Analysis;Quantitative Analysis","Privacy;Ethics;Data privacy;Adaptive systems;Statistical analysis;Education;Learning (artificial intelligence);Trajectory;Digital divide;Artificial intelligence","","","","46","IEEE","20 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding and satisfying client expectations are crucial for growth in the retail industry, which is becoming increasingly competitive. The level of consumer awareness that is typically required for traditional customer relationship management (CRM) solutions to function properly is frequently in excess of what is possible. The present CRM systems' incapacity to process huge, complicated information places a cap on the insights that may be obtained from these data. Specifically, this importance is brought to light by the findings of the study. This is despite the fact that AI and ML have been widely adopted over the past several years. In order to fill in this knowledge vacuum, this study investigates how Deep Support Vector Machines (SVMs) might be utilised to turn consumer data into actionable insight for improved decision-making in retail customer relationship management (CRM). This paper investigates the challenges that can arise when attempting to improve customer relationship management (CRM) in the retail industry by employing AI and ML, more specifically through the application of Deep Support Vector Machines (Deep SVM). The capability of the model to anticipate the actions and preferences of customers will be trained and validated using data collected from actual customers shopping in a number of different retail situations. One of the outcomes that is anticipated is the development of a much improved customer relationship management system that has the capacity to give more accurate customer insights and predictions.","","979-8-3503-7105-5","10.1109/ICDT61202.2024.10488981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10488981","Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Retail Industry;Deep SVM","Support vector machines;Industries;Measurement;Decision making;Customer relationship management;Machine learning;Real-time systems","","1","","16","IEEE","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The role of mechanism evaluation in consumption structure under artificial intelligence is very important, but there is a problem of inaccurate outcome evaluation. The traditional consumption model cannot solve the problem of evaluation of the mechanism of consumption structure under artificial intelligence, and the evaluation is unreasonable. Therefore, this paper proposes a data mining algorithm to evaluate and analyze the mechanism of optimization and innovation. Firstly, the relative income consumption theory is used to evaluate the consumer market, and the indicators are divided according to the requirements of the mechanism evaluation to reduce the interference factors in the evaluation of the mechanism. Then, the relative income consumption theory evaluates the mechanism of consumption upgrading level, forms a mechanism evaluation scheme, and comprehensively analyzes the evaluation results of the mechanism. MATLAB simulation shows that under certain evaluation criteria, the evaluation accuracy of the mechanism of data mining algorithms on the level of consumption upgrading and the quality of consumption structure transformation and upgrading are better than those of traditional consumption patterns.","","979-8-3503-8269-3","10.1109/ICITEICS61368.2024.10625343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10625343","relative income consumption theory;data mining algorithms;consumption structure;Artificial intelligence","Deep learning;Technological innovation;Production;Interference;Mathematical models;Data mining;Artificial intelligence","","","","11","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional approaches find it challenging to satisfy the real-time, efficiency, and safety standards for reorganizing train schedules during such critical situations. This paper introduces a parallel railway traffic management (RTM) system to address the rescheduling of high-speed trains during such emergencies. The design and implementation of the parallel system are detailed using the ACP (Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution) methodology. An agent-based modeling approach is employed to construct the artificial RTM system. The computational experiments are designed and executed to forecast the system's status and assess the rescheduling strategies and algorithms utilizing computer-based simulation technology within the artificial RTM system. Through enabling real-time interaction and closed-loop feedback between the physical RTM system and the actual RTM system, the rescheduling strategies can be continuously assessed and iteratively optimized in real-time. Finally, a case study is conducted in two typical scenarios, involving temporary speed limit and complete blockage, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method through computational experiments. Timetable rescheduling during emergencies is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with various constraints.

Specifically, we will focus on the early development of skills in engineering students, such as numerical manipulation for problem-solving, proficient spreadsheet management, experimental implementation, and mastery of mathematical modeling complemented by informed decision-making with graphics understanding and interpretation. The effective utilization of available technological resources helps to enhance the student learning experience and prepare them for the challenges in their engineering professional practice. Physics courses often present high rates of low academic performance, but these innovative approaches can enhance active student engagement and help nurture essential skills. However, integrating technology into innovative teaching methods can have implications; one seen recently is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (G-AI) in many instruction courses; as a technology of easy access and manipulation, it can result in a confused tool if students don't have the appropriate instruction in its use. Therefore, educating students on the ethical and proper use of AI technology is crucial, guiding them in formulating relevant questions and accurately interpreting the results. To achieve this, we used the Learning Science and Engineering with Electronic Spreadsheets Cycle (LSEESC) methodology, which has been rigorously tested across various contexts over the last four years and has shown promising results. We will support its implementation with comprehensive guidance and use Artificial Intelligence as a prompt/chat tool (e.g., Chat GPT) as a supplementary tool. This strategy aimed to help students develop effective study habits for independent study sessions and promote autonomous learning. We examine how students ask for help from AI, including their choice of words and language. We will also investigate the effects of using casual or informal language and suggest guidelines for constructing practical questions. Our goal was to assist students in obtaining a better understanding and explanations of physics concepts and problem-solving exercises with the help of AI combined with a well-defined methodology, like the LSEESC, which promotes the development of skills like numerical manipulation, mathematical modeling, variables understanding, graphics generation, interpretation, and understanding. The learning intervention considers N = 140 students for working on the LSEESC methodology and using G-AI in physics courses during spring 2024, with students in the first year of academic engineering programs. The topics to evidence the learning process are kinematics and electrics. The results were analyzed with the Normalized Conceptual Gain (NCG) given a value of <g> = 0.75 and 0.67, the Concentration Factor (CF), Rasch's index, and qualitative students' question formulation. This is particularly important because, in some instances, the results provided by G-AI were incorrect owing to the system's inability to detect specific implications that a human can easily recognize; the teacher explained the confused results presented by G-AI and student received the corresponding feedback about these issues with artificial intelligence.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893032","Learning Physics in Engineering Courses;LSEESC Methodology;Artificial Intelligence in the autonomous learning process;Engineering Students;Active learning strategies","Graphics;Generative AI;Active learning;Learning (artificial intelligence);Mathematical models;Cognition;Numerical models;Problem-solving;Springs;Physics","","","","21","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the framework of parallel control, the developed ETDQN incorporates information of actions into the feedback and constructs a dynamic control policy. First, in the realization of the dynamic control policy, we integrate the current state and the previous action to construct the augmented state as well as the augmented Markov decision process. Meanwhile, it is shown theoretically that the goal of the developed dynamic control policy is to learn the variation rate of the action. The augmented state contains information of the current state and the previous action, which enables the developed ETDQN to directly design the immediate reward considering communication loss. Then, based on dueling double deep Q-network (dueling DDQN), we establish the augmented action-value, value, and advantage functions to directly learn the optimal event-triggered decision-making policy of autonomous driving without an explicit triggering condition. It is worth noticing that the developed ETDQN applies to various deep Q-networks (DQNs).

As an emerging privacy-protection method, federated learning (FL) has been used to prevent data breaches in the MMG-related field. However, with the ever-growing participants, the underlying communication burden existing in FL is evident. Besides, since the neural network layers collectively determine an agent’s performance, the possible difference in layer convergence speeds would cause the inconsistency problem, that is, the FL may degrade the convergence rate of those fast-convergent layers, which weakens the overall performance of the agent. To address these issues, a communication-efficient FL (CEFL) algorithm is proposed in this study. Considering the cooperative relationship among layers, a layer evaluation (LE) mechanism is developed in CEFL to evaluate layer contribution through the Shapley value (SV), a profit distribution approach for coalitions. In this way, only partial layers with the highest contributions are selected to be uploaded to the server. In addition, instead of average parameters aggregation, a communication-efficient parameter aggregation method is proposed in CEFL to update the parameters of the global model (GM), in which an aggregation model (AM) is developed to receive parameters for aggregation. The performance of the proposed CEFL is verified by the numerical analysis of MMGs with 3–8 MGs participating. Furthermore, experiments investigate the influence of the hyperparameter in the CEFL and also demonstrate performance improvements, compared with the other four state-of-the-art algorithms.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3432137","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62422308,62233006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701009","Federated learning (FL);multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL);multimicrogrid (MMG);Shapely value (SV)","Energy management;Servers;Privacy;Data privacy;Training;Data breach;Convergence;Federated learning;Data models;Numerical models","","","","","IEEE","1 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

First, to achieve parallel control, an augmented nonlinear system (ANS) with an augmented performance index (API) is proposed to introduce the control input into the feedback system. The control stability relationship between the ANS and the original system is analyzed, and it is shown that, by choosing a proper API, optimal control of the ANS with the API can be seen as near-optimal control of the original system with the original performance index (OPI). Second, based on parallel control, a novel event-triggered scheme is proposed, and then a novel ETNOC method is developed using the time-triggered optimal value function of the ANS with the API. The control stability is proved, and an upper bound, which is related to the design parameter, is provided for the actual performance index in advance. Then, to implement the developed ETNOC method for unknown DT nonlinear systems, a novel online learning algorithm is developed without reconstructing unknown systems, and neural network (NN) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques are employed in the developed algorithm. The convergence of the signals in the closed-loop system (CLS) is shown using the Lyapunov approach, and the assumption of boundedness of input dynamics is not required.

The special manufacturing capability of AM shows great application potential in various fields. However, an open-loop control method cannot guarantee the reliability and repeatability of an AM process. Defects often occur to deteriorate product quality and lead to material and time waste, which hinders the development of AM industry. In this regard, a lot of efforts have been made to make an AM process more controllable. This work proposes an AM control framework that divides the related studies into three feedback loops, including the in-situ monitoring of process defects, fault diagnosis of 3-D printers, and closed-loop control of an AM process. These three loops constitute the inspection and control of AM from the machine level to product level. Specifically, the measurement requirements for monitoring techniques, defect detection, fault diagnosis, and closed-loop control are summarized. The challenges and future trends in realizing a more reliable and repeatable AM process are discussed. Note to Practitioners—This survey is motivated by urgent need to solve product quality problems in additive manufacturing (AM) caused by open-loop control. Three feedback loops can be established to solve them. The first one is defect detection that inspects part quality during fabrication. The second one is the fault diagnosis of a 3-D printer that monitors the health and operation conditions of its actuators. The last one is closed-loop control that improves AM process reliability and repeatability by regulating process variables in real time. These three loops are all based on the feedback signals of in-situ monitoring systems. This paper reviews the related studies and provides guidance for establishing the monitoring systems, performing defect detection and fault diagnosis, and designing closed-loop control systems, which helps realize more reliable and repeatable AM.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3215258","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1702700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1909204,U1909218); Scientific Instrument Developing Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(grant numbers:YZQT014); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021B1515140034); Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Team Project(grant numbers:2018IT100142); Youth Foundation of the State Key Laboratory for Management and Control of Complex Systems(grant numbers:Y6S9011F1G); Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciencias e da Tecnologia (FDCT)(grant numbers:0047/2021/A1); CAS Science and Technology Service Network Initiative (STS) Dongguan Joint Project(grant numbers:20201600200072); CAS Key Technology Talent Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950053","Additive manufacturing (AM);in-situ monitoring;defect detection;fault diagnosis;closed-loop control","Process control;Printers;Manufacturing;Fault diagnosis;Three-dimensional printing;Closed loop systems;Defect detection;Closed loop systems","","41","","278","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main reason behind the growth is the demand for online studies created due to the corona pandemic. The ODL system involves study that is not limited by geographical boundaries and extends to many knowledge areas electronically. In practice the study tends to extend to knowledge areas beyond those offered by the standard contact or traditional universities. At the University of South Africa (UNISA), the adoption of the ODL framework to theoretical subjects has been successful by making use of the Sakai virtual learning environment (VLE). The practical subjects or practical knowledge areas on the other hand have previously been taught face-to-face. Therefore, the practical modules have not been effectively taught online particularly in the electrical engineering curriculum. This issue can contribute to graduates who are unskilled in the practical component of a knowledge area, which can lead to unemployment. Virtual learning environments (VLE's) play a vital role when it comes to teaching and learning online. In this paper, the impact of VLE’s on the practical skills of students and practical knowledge is investigated. This is done by analyzing the change in pass rates of students in a practical subject such as Electrical Engineering when taught face-to-face as compared to when taught through a VLE such as Sakai online. Two groups termed as emerging centered learner (ECL) and a developed centered learner (DCL) are investigated. The method evaluates students who study electrical engineering practical module part-time. In this paper the Sakai platform was used as a VLE to teach and then evaluate students in the electrical engineering practical module. The practical guide with the full set of experiments was uploaded on Sakai under additional resources. The students were given the necessary guidelines and tasks via Sakai online, examined and then the pass rates achieved were analyzed at the end of the program and compared to the pass rates achieved using previous face-to-face teaching method used for the same practical’s. It was determined that a VLE can be used to improve the pass rates of a practical module such as electrical engineering taught online in ODL.","","978-1-6654-8422-0","10.1109/icABCD54961.2022.9856040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856040","Electrical Engineering;Open Distance Learning (ODL);Practical’s;Pass rates;Sakai;Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)","Electrical engineering;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Pandemics;Education;Data communication;Unemployment","","1","","20","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They enhance code maintainability, scalability, and efficiency. However, adopting design patterns presents significant challenges. Developers often face a steep learning curve, misconceptions about the applicability of design patterns, and resistance to change. When design patterns are not used, it can lead to increased technical debt, poor maintainability, and scalability issues. This paper comprehensively analyzes current trends in the usage of design patterns, the challenges faced in their adoption, and the problems resulting from their non-usage. It also explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help mitigate these challenges. AI technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing, offer innovative solutions to promote the adoption of design patterns. These solutions include AI-driven code analysis, pattern recognition, automated refactoring, and intelligent code suggestions. Statistical analysis, case studies, and real-world examples are used to demonstrate AI's potential to transform software development practices. The findings suggest that AI not only facilitates the adoption of design patterns but also significantly enhances the overall software development process. AI-driven tools can analyze code to identify existing design patterns and recommend appropriate ones, thereby helping developers implement them more effectively. Automated refactoring tools can incorporate design patterns into code, improving maintainability and scalability while reducing manual effort. Additionally, AI systems can provide real-time code suggestions, assisting developers in making informed design decisions. By addressing the learning curve and misconceptions associated with design patterns, AI-powered educational tools can further promote their adoption. These tools offer interactive tutorials, code examples, and real-time feedback to help developers understand and apply design patterns correctly. This study contributes to the field by providing actionable insights and practical recommendations for leveraging AI in the adoption and implementation of design patterns. The findings pave the way for more robust and maintainable software systems, highlighting the significant role of AI in overcoming the challenges associated with design patterns. In conclusion, while the adoption of design patterns is fraught with challenges, AI technologies offer promising solutions to facilitate their use. By enhancing the overall software development process, AI can help create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient software systems, ultimately benefiting the entire software engineering field.","","979-8-3315-1905-6","10.1109/ICACCTech65084.2024.00128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10918478","Software Engineering;Design Patterns;Design Principle Developer Productivity;Clean Code;Maintainability;Coding Standards;AI assisted programming;code refactoring","Resistance;Codes;Scalability;Manuals;Software systems;Real-time systems;Natural language processing;Artificial intelligence;Software engineering;Software development management","","","","18","IEEE","13 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, tailoring training for each manufacturer’s model may lead to proprietary information leaks and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present “CSI Meta-knowledge Support”, a cutting-edge CSI feedback network deployment strategy using Learngene, enabling seamless transfer of CSI meta-knowledge across heterogeneous networks. This method captures a Learngene unit enriched with vital CSI meta-knowledge during comprehensive training sessions, serving as a plug-and-play prior to facilitate swift convergence and efficient local fine-tuning for manufacturers. The approach introduces adaptable and scalable CSI feedback network configurations, emphasizing reusability, cost-effectiveness, and resource management while safeguarding intellectual property. Our tests demonstrate enhanced performance, reduced training sample demands, and faster convergence relative to conventional techniques.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2024.3381211","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0701602,2018AAA0100104); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62261160576,62125602,62076063); Key Technologies Research and Development Program of Jiangsu (Prospective and Key Technologies for Industry)(grant numbers:BE2023022,BE2023022-1); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2023A1515110732); National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:MOST 111-2221-E-110-020-MY3); Sixth Generation Communication and Sensing Research Center, funded by Taiwan’s MOE under the Higher Education SPROUT Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10487786","Massive MIMO;CSI feedback;deep learning;transfer learning;meta-knowledge","Artificial intelligence;Data models;Training;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Transfer learning","","","","51","IEEE","1 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, knowing how useful conversational AI is as a virtual tutor is useful during the advancement of education. The Embedded Self-Regulated Learning Framework was based on the LSTM structure of an AI-based chatbot that was used to engage with the student in natural language and assist the student in language exercises in real-time while helping the student navigate learning paths that had been constructed to specifically address the student's needs. A total of 176 junior college students from the University of Alicante Spain, and Silesian University of Technology, Poland participated in the study with B2-C1 language proficiency level of the CEFR and both native and non-native English users were included in the study. Data was collected from February to May, during the Spring term of the 2022 academic year and using two, two hour sessions per week whereby the participants devoted one month of their curriculum to this study. To determine the improvement on the language of the students, tests on the language Proficiency were given both before and after the intervention focusing on the changes on their use of vocabulary, grammar and fluency of the conversation. Quantitative feedback was obtained by use of quantitative questionnaires and tracking of the amount of time users invested in the chatbot and perception of learning. Altogether the study reveals that use of LSTM-based chatbots improves language learning outcomes especially in terms of vocabulary ability and grammatical skills. The participants also expressed higher involvement in terms of participating more in the interactions involving the chatbot and compliments for responsiveness and individuality of the chatbot. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that some obstacles including the provision of the complex language and emotional context were mentioned. Based on the findings, this study suggests that LSTM-based chatbots are very useful in language learning and still, more enhancements could still be made to mitigate these drawbacks and harness the chatbots' functionality for learning enhancement to the maximum.","","979-8-3315-1795-3","10.1109/ICAIQSA64000.2024.10882366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10882366","LSTM-based Chatbots;English Language Learning;Student Engagement;Conversational AI;Language Proficiency","Vocabulary;Quantum computing;Navigation;Natural languages;Oral communication;Learning (artificial intelligence);Chatbots;Real-time systems;Springs;Long short term memory","","","","15","IEEE","21 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To detect pain experiences in infants, we first trained seven Transfer Learning (TL) models (VGG19, DenseNet121, MobileNetv2, InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNetB0, Xception, and ResNet-50) using synthetic images generated with the stable diffusion model. Furthermore, to optimize the model’s performance, we employed a majority vote ensemble method where the final prediction is based on the majority of predictions from these TL models. We analyzed the combined effect of TL models by aggregating predictions from the top three, top five, and all seven TL models through majority voting. Using three TL models, achieved the highest accuracy of ${9 5 . 0 5 \%}$.

One of the greatest potentials of AI is to personalize higher education to the needs of students and offer timely feedback. This could benefit students with disabilities tremendously if their needs are also considered in the development of new AI educational technologies (EdTech). However, current reviews have failed to address the perspective of students with disabilities, which prompts ethical concerns. For instance, AI could treat people with disabilities as outliers in the data and end up discriminating against them. For that reason, this systematic literature review raises the following two questions: To what extent are ethical concerns considered in articles presenting AI applications assessing students (with disabilities) in higher education? What are the potential risks of using AI that assess students with disabilities in higher education? This scoping review highlights the lack of ethical reflection on AI technologies and an absence of discussion and inclusion of people with disabilities. Moreover, it identifies eight risks associated with the use of AI EdTech for students with disabilities. The review concludes with suggestions on how to mitigate these potential risks. Specifically, it advocates for increased attention to ethics within the field, the involvement of people with disabilities in research and development, as well as careful adoption of AI EdTech in higher education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3365368","swissuniversities Project: P7—Accessible teaching in higher education; Swissuniversities Project: P8—Swiss digital skills academy: accessible open educational resources; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10433192","Artificial intelligence;disabilities;higher education;educational technologies (EdTech);ethics;risk assessment","Artificial intelligence;Education;Ethics;Bibliographies;Educational technology;Protocols;Privacy;Assistive technologies;Educational technology;Risk management","","4","","123","CCBY","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study introduces a comprehensive comfort-related processing framework that integrates physiological, environmental, and individual factors, examining physiological signals through occupant preference measurements within interventional chambers. Physiological signals, including skin temperature, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and airflow, are employed to portray an occupant’s physiological response to essential feature parameters. Additionally, variables such as age, sex, and body mass index are utilized to represent occupant preferences. The results reveal a highly significant relationship (p < 0.01) between physiological responses, taste, and satisfaction. This information serves as inputs to assist standard machine learning (ML) algorithms, categorized into probability, geometry, and logical expression, in encoding PTC and effectively predicting occupant satisfaction. The outcomes demonstrate that the logical decision tree, representing logical expression, along with k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks, representing geometry, achieved approximately 90%, 89%, and 80% of the average F-measure, respectively.

Knowledge integration is becoming essential to alleviate the problem. Despite the availability of knowledge representations like the knowledge graph, there is a need for a richer semantic model to capture relationships among products in a domain. Recommender systems inspired by case-based reasoning uses rich domain knowledge in their recommendation process. Conversational case-based reasoning recommender systems (CCBR-RS) are session-based recommender systems that operate under cold-start assumptions. User preferences in such scenarios can only be learned based on the context of the current session. Tradeoffs have been used in literature to model the relationship among products in recommending appropriate products. The models in earlier works have been based on crisp sets, which lack flexibility in capturing varying degrees of tradeoffs, which is a more natural way of dealing with tradeoffs. This work proposes a flexible tradeoff representation scheme based on fuzzy sets to model tradeoffs in terms of linguistic terms and a fuzzy inference system that measures the similarity among tradeoffs represented in linguistic terms.

This paper therefore presents a new approach of increasing feedback enhancement by incorporating a Double Integral Transformer (DIT) model within the assessment process. The DIT model is an improved version of the regular Transformer architecture which employs two, or rather dual integral attention modules, to handle both the local and global contextual semantics of the language use more efficiently. With help of this model, the feedback process can be more accurate, accurate and individual for each learner. The Double Integral Transformer evaluates linguistic data by employing double attention layer that combines data at the syntactic and semantic level to enhance the quality of feedback given accurately. It improves the recognition of learners' strengths and weaknesses concerning the language in question and provides customized feedback that is apparently more accurate. The enhanced feeback mechanism reduces problems that are associated current assessment practices: for example, general feedback and lack of context awareness. In this study, the author presents the empirical support for the effectiveness of the DIT model to enhance the quality of the feedback is a major contribution of this study as it results in better learner performance and satisfaction.

Evaluation results from various companies indicate significant gains in beam management and positioning through AI integration. While AI can replace traditional mechanisms to enhance performance, it also introduces new overheads. For example, the introduction of AI models necessitates addressing model life cycle management (LCM) issues, such as model identification, activation/deactivation, monitoring, updating/finetuning, selection, switching. These operations result in a significant amount of overhead. In this paper, we present the progress of model LCM in 3GPP, and also propose a tree-structured model to reduce the overhead associated with LCM operations. This model can be used in scenarios where multiple models serve the same functionality by merging similar structures, thereby saving storage space, and making the processes of model switching, expansion, and deletion more effective.

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities.

However, in reality, most machine learning models, despite achieving good technical solutions to predictive problems wind up not being deployed. The reasons for this are many and have their origin in data scientists and machine learning practitioners not paying enough attention to issues of deployment in production. The issues range all the way from establishing trust by business stakeholders and users, to failure to explain why models work and when they do not, to failing to appreciate the importance of establishing a robust quality data pipeline, to ignoring many constraints that apply to deployed models, and finally to a lack of understanding the true cost of production deployment and the associated ROI.

However, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) - AI systems using transformer technology, with billions of parameters and trained on large text datasets - offers innovative solutions to these challenges by enhancing rubric-based grading as it can produce content that matches or exceeds human quality. This study explores the potential of LLMs to complement human judgment in evaluating graduate-level statistics projects, addressing a critical gap in research on AI applications in statistics education. Using a comparative methodology, the study examines grading outcomes from human instructors and LLMs to evaluate consistency and accuracy. Key findings revealed a moderate to strong alignment between ChatGPT and human evaluators, with an ICC of 0.72 in objective areas, and 0.65 in more subjective sections. Integrating LLMs like ChatGPT enhances grading reliability, reduces bias, and provides students with detailed, constructive feedback. These results highlight the significance of adopting a hybrid AI-human framework to develop more equitable and consistent grading practices, ultimately advancing the effectiveness of assessments in higher education.","2159-5119","979-8-3503-6735-5","10.1109/ICTMOD63116.2024.10878239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10878239","Large Language Models (LLMs);AI-driven as-sessment;Grading consistency;Hybrid AI-human framework;Rubric-based evaluation","Technology management;Accuracy;Large language models;Education;Chatbots;Transformers;Reliability;Faces","","","","24","IEEE","19 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generative models including ChatGPT 3.5 turbo and Gemini 1.5 flash get enhanced presence when trained using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. First, the ability for users to speak English makes for an almost informal procedure when learning since the user and the computer are communicating with one another by use of words. In addition to this, targeted feedback modules make an assessment of the user's input and give an immediate-feedback of what is required in terms of improving a user's vocabulary, grammar, and fluency. It offers another learning approach since it presents the content in a manner that is suited more to the current ability level of the user and the usage of preferred learning objectives.

However, existing methods for log anomaly detection face several challenges, including limitations in recognizing current types of anomalous logs and difficulties in performing online incremental updates to the anomaly detection models. To address these challenges, this paper introduces DRLLog, which applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) networks to detect anomalous events. DRLLog uses Deep Q Network (DQN) as the agent, with log entries serving as reward signals. By interacting with the environment generated from log data and adopting various action behaviors, it aims to maximize the reward value obtained as feedback. Through this approach, DRLLog achieves learning from historical log data and perception of the current environment, enabling continuous learning and adaptation to different log sequence patterns. Additionally, DRLLog introduces low-rank adaptation by using two low-rank parameter matrices in the fully connected layer of the DQN to represent changes in its weight matrix. During online model learning, only low-rank parameter matrices of the model are updated, effectively reducing the model’s overhead. Furthermore, DRLLog introduces focal loss to focus more on learning the features of anomalous logs, effectively addressing the issue of imbalanced quantities between normal and anomalous logs. We evaluated the performance on widely used log datasets, including HDFS, BGL and ThunderBird, showing an average improvement of 3% in F1-Score compared to baseline methods. During online model learning, DRLLog achieves an average reduction of 90% in parameter count and a significant decrease in training and testing time as well.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2025.3542595","the Key Research and Development Program of Hubei Province(grant numbers:No. 2022BAA050); the National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:No. 2022YFB3104001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10891191","Log anomaly detection;Deep reinforcement learning;Low rank adaptation;Focal loss","Anomaly detection;Adaptation models;Data models;Training;Feature extraction;Vectors;Deep reinforcement learning;Semantics;Real-time systems;Q-learning","","","","","IEEE","17 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It does not rely on the support of external systems or software, and can complete various tasks and operations autonomously. Autonomous systems are often highly intelligent and adaptive in that they can acquire environmental information through sensors, analyze and process that information to make appropriate responses, and perform tasks without human intervention. Autonomous systems have a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, automated control and other fields, which can improve production efficiency, reduce costs, improve safety and reliability. However, most of the existing methods of autonomous systems are based on traditional machine learning or reinforcement learning. This paper proposes an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to improve the learning efficiency of autonomous systems - LHU algorithm. The simulation dialogue experience is obtained from the interaction between autonomous systems and trainable user models. A posterior-session experience is the synthesis of successful session data by the posterior-module by acting on those failed session fragments and user goals. The dialogue experiences obtained from the user model and the posterior module provide more dialogue examples and positive feedback on dialogue strategy learning respectively. Finally, the reliability of the model is verified by experiments.","","979-8-3503-1467-0","10.1109/ICIPCA59209.2023.10257710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257710","innovative research;LHU algorithm;autonomous system","Machine learning algorithms;Autonomous systems;Reinforcement learning;Production;Data models;Software;Sensor systems","","","","16","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches typically overlook the abundant annotations contained in the ESC dataset, such as the situation descriptions and feedback scores of seekers, which limits their performance. In an effort to utilize the annotation information to enhance the emotional support ability of the backbone, we propose a three-stage training method called BlenderBot-ThTra for ESC systems. The proposed BlenderBot- ThTra involves the following three training processes: fine-tuning with supplemental feedback utterance, fine-tuning with auxiliary situation restoration, and calibration with the helpfulness estimation. The first stage aims to intensify the backbone’s perception of conversational context, the second stage propels the backbone into excavating the causes of the emotional distress faced by the seeker. In the third stage, we leverage a Bayesian method based on the seeker’s feedback scores to train a helpfulness evaluation model, then exploit a contrastive learning method to calibrate the ESC backbone. We conduct experiments on the standard multiturn ESC dataset, and the results demonstrate that BlenderBot-ThTra has a significant advantage in generating more supportive and adaptive responses.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2024.3477531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10735791","Dialog generation;dialog system;emotional support conversation (ESC);multistage learning","Training;Emotion recognition;History;Contrastive learning;Bayes methods;Semantics;Predictive models;Measurement;Evaluation models;Data models","","","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Results show that K-means and Neural Networks are the most commonly used methodologies for driver profile identification, and Dynamic Time Warping for driving pattern detection. Most studies discovered driver profiles related to aggressiveness, considering mainly speed and acceleration as driving metrics. Based on the gaps and challenges identified, this paper provides a new framework for combining microscopic and macroscopic driving behavior analysis, instead of examining them separately as is the state-of-theart. Such combined results can potentially improve the development of traffic risk models, which could be exploited in applications that monitor drivers in real-time and provide feedback.

However, those principles are very abstract and not practical enough. Further, significant efforts have been put on algorithm-level solutions that only address a narrow set of principles, such as fairness and privacy. To fill the gap, we adopt a pattern-oriented RAI engineering approach and build an RAI pattern catalog to operationalize RAI from a system perspective. In this article, we first summarize the major challenges in operationalizing RAI at scale and introduce how we use the RAI pattern catalog to address those challenges.

As a result, team-based learning throughout engineering education has become increasingly popular, especially in first-year programs. Tools such as CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a web-based program used by instructors, help instructors form student teams based on predefined criteria, facilitate peer evaluations to assess individual contributions and performance, and gather general feedback on student teamwork experiences. Other instructors may collect peer feedback through other methods, such as submitted assignments. Theories in organizational psychology highlight the relationship between performance feedback, psychological safety, and conflict management. To purposefully help students develop essential teamwork skills, such as how to manage conflict and build inclusive, psychologically safe teams effectively, it is important that they receive individual performance feedback. However, negative, unfiltered feedback from peers may also escalate unhealthy team dynamics. Consequently, instructors can be hesitant to share peer evaluation scores and comments with students because students may not be comfortable sharing honest, authentic feedback with their peers. However, withholding this valuable formative feedback to students may come at the expense of their individual professional development, especially in devel-oping teamwork skills. Additionally, these project-based learning (PBL) courses tend to be large, and summarizing formative feedback for individual students based on peer evaluations can be time-consuming and perhaps unrealistic with increasing class sizes. To address this need, we present the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system to create individual performance summaries based on student peer responses. The authors present preliminary work from a pilot study that uses generative AI to produce individual performance summaries using CATME data from a first-year engineering course at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We share a sample output performance summary using a generative AI tool, GPT-4 specifically. Our initial findings indicate AI tools, such as GPT-4, can serve as a solution to provide more confidentiality in peer comments by effectively summarizing peer comments and producing individual performance feedback reviews. This study provides promising initial findings and recommendations on how AI can be leveraged to automate a student feedback process for instructors, allowing students to receive individual performance feedback while also providing an additional layer of confidentiality to support team dynamics and not compromise honest individual assessments.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343517","AI;feedback;peer comments;teamwork","Psychology;Teamwork;Safety;Artificial intelligence;Engineering students","","2","","23","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In cluttered environments such as the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), clinical measures are often influenced by noise and artifacts. An important component in post-operative treatment is the assessment and management of pain levels. However, reliable information is critical for clinically relevant results and improved patient outcomes. From a control engineering point of view, variables are often estimated and interpolated to allow a suitable flow of feedback information to control loops for the optimization of drug dosages. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a promising tool to augment pain level assessment. This study introduces and compares two AI-based approaches for predicting continuous Numerical Rating Scales (NRS) based on heart rate (HR) data. The first approach uses polynomial regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression, while the second employs an LSTM model. Notably, the AI prediction model, independent of traditional interpolation techniques, outperforms the approach relying on interpolation. The proposed AI-based method holds promise for continuous estimation and can serve as an estimator for model-based control.

However, monitoring one's posture can be challenging, often leading to improper form and reduced effectiveness. To address this issue, this project presents an innovative real-time posture monitoring system using computer vision and pose estimation techniques. The system employs the Mediapipe library to detect and analyze the user's body posture through a camera feed. It begins by capturing a reference posture from an image and calculating its landmark coordinates. These coordinates serve as the baseline for correct posture. As the user performs exercises in front of the camera, their live posture is continuously evaluated against the reference posture using Euclidean distance as a similarity metric. A crucial contribution of this project lies in its ability to provide immediate feedback to the user regarding their posture. The system visualizes landmarks on the user's body, highlighting correct and incorrect positions in distinct colors. If the similarity score between the live posture and the reference posture surpasses a certain threshold, the landmarks appear in green, indicating good posture. Conversely, red landmarks indicate discrepancies, prompting the user to adjust their form. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed system in real-time posture assessment. Users can actively observe their posture and make necessary adjustments, fostering improved exercise outcomes and reduced risk of injuries. By offering a convenient and immediate feedback mechanism, this project bridges the gap between remote fitness practices and professional guidance, ultimately promoting safer and more effective workout routines","","979-8-3503-0570-8","10.1109/RMKMATE59243.2023.10368735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368735","Deep learning;online Yoga trainer;Artificial Intelligence;Mediapipe","Training;Measurement;Visualization;Pose estimation;Cameras;Real-time systems;Libraries","","1","","10","IEEE","3 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We provide a qualitative analysis of students' reflections on teamwork in the IT project management course, alongside standardized course feedback. Students collaborate in teams of 5–7 on self-selected topics, creating coarse prototypes. The analysis revealed key success factors in teamwork, including effective communication, apportionment of work, regular meetings, and high motivation. Barriers included poor time management, unproductive meetings, external obligations, and absenteeism. Course feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with students valuing the course structure, atmosphere, and lecturer. Suggestions for improvement focused on workload reduction.

Conventionally, a battery management system (BMS) involves algorithm development for battery modeling, estimation, and control. These tasks are typically validated by running the battery tester open-loop, i.e., the tester equipment executes the predefined experimental protocols line by line. Additional equipment is required to make the testing closed-loop, but the integration is typically not straightforward. To improve flexibility and accessibility for battery management, this work proposes a low-cost highly reliable closed-loop charger and discharger. We first focus on the electronic circuit design for battery testing systems to maximize the applied current accuracy and precision. After functional verification, we further investigate applications for closed-loop BMSs. In particular, we extend the proposed architecture into the learning-based control design, which is a feedback controller. We utilize reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to highlight the benefits of closed-loop controls. As an example, we compare this learning-based control strategy with a conventional battery charging control.

We aimed to create a rule-based set of guidelines for the desired hierarchy, timing, content, and modality of feedback such a system should provide to users, such that they receive the necessary feedback, at the relevant time, in a way that enhances their performance, and does not encumber it. We conducted four focus groups with 20 stroke clinicians. The clinicians described the guiding principles they use when giving feedback to patients, and noted different output should be provided to the patient versus the clinician by the rehabilitation system. They delineated a hierarchy for providing feedback during the exercise set: success on the task is the primary goal, and feedback should be given on this aspect first. Once success is achieved, feedback should be given on the quality of the movement. Only when the task is successfully completed, with no compensatory movements (i.e., high quality), feedback should be given on movement speed. Using a follow-up survey and the member-checking approach, it was revealed that this hierarchical structure applies to early stages in the rehabilitation process, and that quality of movement becomes paramount as the rehabilitation process progresses. The clinicians expressed their desire to receive a full report on the patient's performance in each exercise session, which is more comprehensive than the feedback provided to the patient in real time.

Machine learning can be used to determine channels for communication in a customer alert system used by financial services institutions (FSIs). This work offers a machine-learning-enabled channel selection and management method based on Tug Of War (TOW) algorithm. The framework proposed will be based on the TOW dynamics algorithm. TOW uses a modified learning technique based on addition and subtraction's reward/loss principle. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy by prototyping the proposed framework in a customer alert system termed the ML-Enabled MCM system. Messaging channels such as SMS, Email, Twitter Direct Messages, Instagram Direct Messages, Telegram, and Facebook Direct Messages were integrated with an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) responsible for channel management.

The RL set of rules may be used to optimize the general performance of a recommender machine with the useful resource of getting to know from customer interactions. Whenever the tool makes a prediction, it receives comments based on whether or not it has become accurate or incorrect. This remark is used to replace the RL algorithm, supporting it to apprehend the person’s opportunities better and make greater correct predictions. The RL algorithm can be used to find out styles in consumer feedback, which can be used to decorate the recommender tool’s accuracy.

The traditional manual marking method has some disadvantages, such as time-consuming, laborious, untimely feedback and difficult to be comprehensive. With the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) technology, its application in the field of education gradually shows great potential. This paper aims to develop an automatic marking system for English writing based on NLP, so as to improve the efficiency of writing teaching and students' writing ability. The system adopts hierarchical architecture, including data layer, processing layer, service layer and application layer to ensure the scalability and maintainability of the system. The main functional modules include composition management, automatic grading, error detection and correction, writing style analysis and feedback and report. The system trains a large number of English composition samples through the deep learning model, realizes automatic grading and error detection, and provides detailed feedback reports, including corrections of grammatical errors, spelling errors and improper vocabulary use. The experimental results show that the system is excellent in scoring accuracy, and the correlation coefficient with expert scoring is as high as 0.9 or more. The system can not only give the total score, but also provide personalized feedback reports to help students understand their own shortcomings more clearly and make improvements. Compared with traditional marking methods, automatic marking system has obvious advantages in marking efficiency, scoring consistency and personalized feedback ability. The research in this paper provides new ideas and methods for the automation and intelligence of English writing teaching, which has important theoretical significance and practical value.","","979-8-3315-1903-2","10.1109/ICDACAI65086.2024.00126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10835616","natural language processing;automatic evaluation system;english writing;teaching software","Deep learning;Correlation coefficient;Vocabulary;Accuracy;Education;Training data;Manuals;Writing;Natural language processing;Software","","","","10","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We tested and compared these tactics to famous ones. ADN's machine vision and deep learning make it quick at issue detection. We proved it was the most accurate technique to detect even the slightest issues via testing. This ensures our products fulfill our requirements. The RO offers a unique perspective on quality control improvement. Since it can mend itself and learn from its errors, it reduces check-taking staff and expenses. We observed that it may boost flexibility and ability. PAM predicts repair characteristics will occur much faster than in scheduled maintenance. Advance machine learning and sensor data analysis detect issues before they occur in predictive asset maintenance (PAM). This reduces expensive unexpected downtime and extends equipment life. The strategies exhibited greatly effect smart workplace adoption in many contexts. ADN, RO, and PAM combined provide incredible precision, speed, and flexibility in maintenance and quality control.

In response to these challenges, we introduce the Dynamic Task Scheduling Algorithm based on Learning Automata (DTSALA). This algorithm harnesses the adaptive learning mechanism inherent in Learning Automata (DTSALA). Throughout the iterative looping process of the algorithm, the action probability distribution model undergoes continuous updates triggered by reward and punishment signals. The adaptive learning mechanism serves to mitigate resource wastage and prevent system overload by dynamically adjusting task scheduling actions based on prevailing system conditions. To assess the efficacy of the DTSALA algorithm, we conducted simulations comparing its performance with that of other widely used task scheduling algorithms, such as Max-Min, Min-Min, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Hybrid Whale Genetic Algorithm (HWGA). The simulation results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of the DTSALA algorithm, showcasing improvements in load balancing rate, task execution time, and system resource utilization when compared to these algorithms. By achieving a heightened load balancing rate, the DTSALA algorithm ensures equitable distribution of tasks across available system resources, thereby optimizing resource utilization. Furthermore, it reduces task execution time through efficient allocation of tasks to appropriate resources, ultimately enhancing the overall system performance and user experience within the cloud computing environment.","","979-8-3503-8555-7","10.1109/AINIT61980.2024.10581754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10581754","component;cloud computing;task scheduling;learning automata;load balancing","Cloud computing;Scheduling algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Learning automata;Whales;Dynamic scheduling;Load management","","","","20","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Flappy Bird, a popular 2D mobile game, is known for its simplicity and addictive gameplay. However, the static nature of its levels limits longterm engagement. To address this limitation, we have developed an AI-powered Flappy Bird game that dynamically generates unique levels, enhancing player enjoyment and retention. Our AI system employs a combination of reinforcement learning and procedural content generation techniques to create levels that adapt to the player’s skill level and preferences. During gameplay, the AI continuously assesses the player’s performance, adjusting the level’s difficulty to maintain an optimal balance between challenge and enjoyment. This dynamic level generation ensures that players of all skill levels can enjoy the game while also providing a sense of achievement as they progress. In addition to the AI-driven level generation, our game features a variety of visual themes, obstacles, and power-ups to keep gameplay fresh and engaging. The integration of AI not only enhances the player experience but also provides an opportunity for datadriven analysis and feedback, enabling further improvements in game design and balance. Overall, our AI-based Flappy Bird game represents an exciting fusion of classic gameplay with cutting-edge technology.

Most state-of-the-art techniques tackle the problem of detecting network anomalies with high precision but the models don’t provide an interpretable solution. This makes it hard for operators to adopt the given solutions. The proposed Cluster Characterized Autoencoder (CCA) architecture improves model interpretability by designing an end-to-end data driven AI-based framework. Candidate anomalies identified using the feature optimised Autoencoder and entropy based feature ranking are clustered in reconstruction error space using subspace clustering. This clustering is seen to separate true positives and false positives and how well this is done is evaluated using entropy and information gain. A two dimensional t-SNE representation of anomaly clusters is used as a graphical interface to the analysis and explanation of individual anomalies using SHAP values. The solution provided by this unsupervised approach helps the analyst in the categorisation, identification and feature explanation of anomalies providing faster root cause analysis.

The framework integrates three systems: the Student Industry Placement System (SIPS), which uses machine learning to match students with relevant internships; the Intern Learning Management System (ILMS), which tracks skill development through continuous feedback loops; and the Industry Profiling System (IPS), which leverages predictive analytics to provide real-time labour market insights. The framework was evaluated through a mixed-methods approach, incorporating pilot program data from five universities and 15 industry partners and simulated data based on historical internship trends. The SIPS algorithm achieved a placement accuracy of 89%, significantly improving over traditional methods (60-65%). 78% of students received continuous feedback through the ILMS, resulting in measurable improvements in technical skills (30% increase in coding proficiency) and problem-solving abilities (25% improvement). The IPS enabled universities to update 15% of their curricula in response to real-time labour market data, particularly in high-growth sectors such as AI and digital transformation. 68% of the students secured full-time employment within six months of graduation, with 65% in roles directly aligned with their internships. These findings demonstrate the framework's scalability and potential for reducing skills mismatch, making it a viable model for other emerging economies.","2996-2331","979-8-3315-3221-5","10.1109/LT64002.2025.10940990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10940990","Skills Mismatch;Internship Placement;Learning Management Systems;Advanced Placement Systems","Industries;Learning management systems;Tracking loops;Accuracy;Scalability;Education;Employment;Real-time systems;IP networks;Problem-solving","","","","18","IEEE","1 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Network System of Systems Manager","J. Dobie; R. Holder","L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Melbourn, Florida; L3Harris Technologies, Inc., Melbourn, Florida","2024 Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","11 Jun 2024","2024","","","1","14","For several decades, the L3Harris Mission Networks organization has perfected the design, deployment, operations, and management of enterprise-level networks for safety-critical missions using a managed service framework. L3Harris has successfully constructed geographically large and technologically diverse Local Area Network (LAN)/Wide Area Network (WAN) solutions for State and Federal customers by selecting, optimizing, and integrating Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) products and services into an integrated or homogeneous solution meeting exacting performance requirements. These purpose-built network solutions ensure performance and resilience through tailored provisioning and the configuration of highly reliable (e.g., through adaptive redundancy) architectures, diverse service connections and equipment, ubiquitous bandwidth allocation and an unparalleled telecommunication provider governance by a centralized operational support system.Over this same period, there have been key advances in the networking industry which signal the need to evolve beyond our centralized managed services model. These advances include the rapid industry transition from a dedicated Time-division Multiple Access (TDMA)-based solution to multifunction IP-based networks with Quality of Service (QoS) support, the growing deployment of Software Defined Everything (SDE), AI-assisted advanced modeling and simulation, near-universal adoption of cloud-based Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), design patterns and deployment solutions with the increasing presence of wireless services such as 5G (both fixed and mobile), Long Term Evolution (LTE), Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).Within these evolving technologies, network management solutions can move from centralized to federated architectures with the promise of effortless scalability, dynamic adaptability, and seamless collaboration. A federated hierarchical architecture offers organizations a blueprint allowing coordinated management, interoperability of data, resources and processes across heterogeneous systems, locations, and organizational boundaries. To take maximum advantage of such an architecture, we believe there is an opportunity to streamline and optimize network designs through an implementation of a Network System of Systems Manager (NSoSM). The NSoSM is a centralized system used to ingest network telemetry data across one or more networks, process data via AI/ML algorithms, to make informed decisions to improve the delivery of prioritized customer data and improve the usability of mission critical customer applications.The federated architecture construct, consisting of loosely coupled constituent databases for sharing and data exchange, has evolved beyond its origin and the set of standards facilitating its integration. The use of an Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) [01], the International Society of Automation (ISA)-95 model [02], the Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association (MESA) Business to Manufacturing Markup Language (B2MML) [03], and message exchange models have improved integration and scalability, resulting in wide adoption in manufacturing environments.The adoption of a federated architecture in enterprise-level, mission critical networks present several challenges. The solution to these challenges can be addressed with three primary capabilities: 1) Integrated Situational Awareness; 2) Integration Gateway, and 3) AI Augmentation and Automated Orchestration, carrying independent value and, when fused together, achieve a NSoSM which autonomously supports a federated ecosystem:Integrated Situational Awareness. Adapting to the increasing volume of technological solutions, the need for highly customized service integrator solutions evolves from a centralized integration of disparate platforms to an enterprise orchestration of integrated System-of-Systems (SoS). This is achieved through creating a hyperconverged monitoring and data collection capability of system logs, synthetic network probes, streaming telemetry and real-time channel performance metrics collected by Fault Management Systems, Network Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics Systems, and Application Performance Monitoring systems. Integrating these COTS solutions, together with Situational Awareness, offer end-to-end (E2E) planning, fault analysis, and command and control (C2) of regulated network environments.Integration Gateway. Of critical importance in the NSoSM model is the need to create a homogeneous, clear user experience across a heterogeneous collection of federated systems. This involves the definition and harmonization of the exchanged data and the technologies used for sending and receiving the exchanged data with intelligent markers to incorporate customer and mission-defined, protections. This involves both the harmonization of data from dissimilar heterogeneous end-systems to a common operating picture and to convert it back to native system languages when suggested configurations are being recommended to optimize customer service performance.AI Augmentation and Automated Orchestration (AIA2O). This capability is comprised of three primary and sequential functions: Datasets, Frameworks and Procedure Validation for AIOps and Command and Control (C2) Orchestration. Data from the Integration Gateway is interpreted into logical threads where Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and models apply insight to optimizations required for an improved User Experience (UX), via autonomous orchestration, reducing and sometimes eliminating the human-in-the-loop delay not only reducing the decision chain but also reducing human error. Insights and procedures are validated in a digital twin representation followed by the orchestration of optimizations in a production environment.The Federal Aviation Administration’s publication of Initial Concept of Operations for an Info-Centric National Airspace System asserts that ""The integrated information environment, providing data services including data integration from various sources, allows federated actors to reconcile, contextualize, and share relevant information’’. Additionally, value is perceived by enabling ""multiple entities to provide a federated set of xTM services for flights operating within the same airspace"". Implementing and operating NSoSM capabilities, comprised of an integrated gateway, integrated situational awareness, and AI augmentation and automated orchestration are at the core of where mission critical, enterprise-level networks and SDE are evolving for State, Federal, and Department of Defense (DoD) organizations. L3Harris’ approach to the design of a NSoSM solution provides a limitless overlay adapting to emerging and evolving technologies, meanwhile reduce operating expenses (OpEx) via an ever-growing AI community, enabling independent systems to collectively deliver value that cannot be achieved independently.","2155-4951","979-8-3503-9309-5","10.1109/ICNS60906.2024.10550591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550591","Network Automation;Machine Learning;Autonomous Networking;Network Data Analytics;Situational Awareness","Command and control systems;Adaptive systems;Mission critical systems;Computer architecture;Organizations;Logic gates;User experience","","","","12","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these systems, recommendation models are often learned from the users’ historical behaviors that are automatically collected. Notably, recommender systems differ slightly from ordinary supervised learning tasks. In recommender systems, there is an exposure mechanism that decides which items could be presented to each specific user, which breaks the i.i.d assumption of supervised learning and brings biases into the recommendation models. In this paper, we focus on unbiased ranking loss weighted by inversed propensity scores (IPS), which are widely used in recommendations with implicit feedback labels. More specifically, we first highlight the fact that there is a gap between theory and practice in IPS-weighted unbiased loss. The existing pairwise loss could be theoretically unbiased by adopting an IPS weighting scheme. Unfortunately, the propensity scores are hard to estimate due to the inaccessibility of each user-item pair's true exposure status. In practical scenarios, we can only approximate the propensity scores. In this way, the theoretically unbiased loss would be still practically biased. To solve this problem, we first construct a theoretical framework to obtain a generalization upper bound of the current theoretically unbiased loss. The bound illustrates that we can ensure the theoretically unbiased loss's generalization ability if we lower its implementation loss and practical bias at the same time. To that aim, we suggest treating feedback label $Y_{ui}$Yui as a noisy proxy for exposure result $O_{ui}$Oui for each user-item pair $(u, i)$(u,i). Here we assume the noise rate meets the condition that $\hat{P}(O_{ui}=1, Y_{ui}\ne O_{ui}) < 1/2$P^(Oui=1,Yui≠Oui)<1/2. According to our analysis, this is a mild assumption that can be satisfied by many real-world applications. Based on this, we could train an accurate propensity model directly by leveraging a noise-resistant loss function. Then we could construct a practically unbiased recommendation model weighted by precise propensity scores. Lastly, experimental findings on public datasets demonstrate our suggested method's effectiveness.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2024.3519711","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0102000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62225601,U23B2052,62236008,U21B2038,U23B2051,61931008,62122075,62206264,92370102); Youth Innovative Research Team of BUPT(grant numbers:2023YQTD02); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB0680000); Innovation Funding of ICT,CAS(grant numbers:E000000); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L242025); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:F2024502017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10810273","Recommender system;collaborative filtering;debias;noise-robust learning;pairwise ranking loss","Estimation;Imputation;Training data;IP networks;Accuracy;Supervised learning;Recommender systems;Noise;Data models;Computer science","","","","72","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Xu","Liaocheng Technician College Liaocheng, Shangdong, China",2024 International Conference on Interactive Intelligent Systems and Techniques (IIST),"4 Nov 2024","2024","","","274","278","With the growth of emerging technologies such as software defined networks, network function virtualization, and fifth generation communication, while improving network flexibility and controllability, it has also brought unprecedented challenges to the efficient adaptation of network resources such as routing, computing, and storage. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can establish a trial reward feedback mechanism in a different way from traditional optimization algorithms, accumulate experience for learning, and thus achieve optimization goals. This paper proposes a DRL based network resource allocation algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems in network resource allocation. By combining deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to construct a neural network, energy efficiency is used as a reward and punishment value, historical data is saved in an experience pool, and the weight parameters of the network are trained using gradient descent method. The algorithm has the ability to autonomously allocate and make decisions, dynamically adjust channel and power allocation according to environmental conditions, and obtain a approximately optimal allocation strategy. The simulation results show that over against other resource allocation methods, the resource allocation method proposed in this paper can effectively improve system throughput, and has good channel adaptability and convergence.","","979-8-3503-7442-1","10.1109/IIST62526.2024.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10734532","deep reinforcement learning;network resources;optimization allocation algorithm","Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Neural networks;Throughput;Deep reinforcement learning;Approximation algorithms;Energy efficiency;Resource management;Optimization;Convergence","","1","","13","IEEE","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, when a garbage separator has to separate different categories of material like human learning does, there is a need to make them to explore an innovative application of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of separation and selection. But before to start the process it is very important to perform a comparative study on existing methodologies [1]–[50] by avoiding duplication of existing work. Thus, in this paper we perform a comparative study on a large number of recent methods and we provide our overall evaluation. Then we proceed with one extra step by improving a low performing methodology to elevate its performance by showing to our team the collaborative work for better results. Thus, it is crucial for effective waste management to leverage RL algorithms to optimize the sorting process in real-time, adapting dynamically to changes in the waste stream. By integrating sensors and AI techniques the smart garbage separator behaves as an autonomous agent within its operational environment, making decisions to classify and direct waste into appropriate categories such as recyclables, organics, and landfill. The RL model employs a reward-based system where actions—defined as sorting decisions—are continuously refined based on feedback regarding sorting accuracy and processing speed. Using a combination of real-world data collection and simulated environments, we implement and compare traditional Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms to determine their efficacy in handling complex, high-dimensional state spaces typical of waste material characteristics. The results indicate significant improvements in sorting accuracy and operational efficiency, showcasing the potential of RL to transform waste management practices.","","979-8-3503-6883-3","10.1109/IISA62523.2024.10786620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10786620","Smart sensors;garbage separation;recycling technologies;machine learning;reinforcement learning","Waste management;Adaptation models;Waste materials;Accuracy;Particle separators;Urban planning;User interfaces;Real-time systems;Artificial intelligence;Sorting","","","","52","IEEE","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Efficient communication between instructors and students is integral to supporting a productive learning environment. Recognizing the significance of understanding students' perceptions and challenges, we present the initial implementation of a system to help instructors analyze and respond to students' feedback promptly and effectively. This research is inspired by and extends prior works where instructors sent progress check emails to students, with some works finding that such communication increased students' motivation. To collect feedback, we administer regular student reflections throughout the semester that capture how students feel about the course and uncover the challenges they face. This regular feedback-gathering approach allows instructors to better track their students' progress and respond to comments throughout the semester to provide guidance. However, reading and responding to each reflection manually in the context of their overall learning experience can be time consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based automated approach that generates tailored, performance-contextualized responses to student reflections that can be used to guide first-contact interventions. The generated reflection responses (GRRs) address issues discussed in student reflections and provide advice, support, course information, and follow-up questions to the students. Additionally, they provide feedback to students based on their accomplishments and behavioral data within the learning management system (LMS), such as submission patterns. In this work, we discuss our method of generating responses based on students' reflections and their LMS behavior. We also present example scenarios of the proposed approach. Preliminary results indicate that this approach can help instructors facilitate positive educational interactions with students and that the participating students view the interventions favorably, fostering a constructive learning environment.

Previous studies investigating the COVID-19 pandemic forecast have either lacked generalization and scalability or lacked surveillance data. City administrators have also often relied heavily on open-loop, belief-based decision-making, preventing them from identifying and enforcing timely policies. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analyses based on closed-loop decisions for COVID-19. Combining epidemiological theories with machine learning models gives this study a more accurate prediction of COVID-19’s growth, and suggests policies to regulate it. The Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (SIR) model was analyzed using a machine learning model to estimate the optimal constant parameters, which are the recovery and infection rates of the coupled nonlinear differential equations that govern the epidemic model. To modulate the optimized parameters that regulate pandemic suppression and mitigation, a systematically designed feedback-based strategy was implemented. We also used pulse width modulation to modify on-off signals in order to regulate policy enforcement according to established metrics, such as infection recovery ratios. It was possible to determine what type of policy should be implemented in the country, as well as how long it should be implemented. Using datasets from John Hopkins University for six countries, India, Iran, Italy, Germany, Japan, and the United States, we show that our 30-day prediction errors are almost less than 3%. Our model proposes a threshold mechanism for policy control that divides the policy implementation into seven states, for example, if Infection Recovery Ratio (IRR) >80, we suggest a complete lockdown, vs if 10¡IRR¡20, we suggest encouraging people to stay at home and organizations to work at 50% capacity. All countries which implemented a policy control strategy at an early stage were accurately predicted by our model. Furthermore, it was determined that the implementation of closed-loop strategies during a pandemic at different times effectively controlled the pandemic.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9893130","Covid-19;pandemic;policy management;SIR;machine learning;regression;control theory;transfer function","Pandemics;Mathematical models;Predictive models;COVID-19;Diseases;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Transfer functions","","4","","52","CCBY","15 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dynamic nature of vehicular environments, characterized by high mobility and extensive interactions among vehicles, necessitates considering time-varying statistical regularities, especially in scenarios with sharp variations. Despite the widespread use of traditional reinforcement learning for resource allocation, its limitations in generalization and interpretability are evident. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Intelligence-based Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm. This algorithm utilizes active inference to infer the real world and maintain an internal model by minimizing free energy. Enhancing the efficiency of active inference, we incorporate prior knowledge as macro guidance, ensuring more accurate and efficient training. By constructing an intelligence-based model, we eliminate the need for designing reward functions, aligning better with human thinking, and providing a method to reflect the learning, information transmission and intelligence accumulation processes. This approach also allows for quantifying intelligence to a certain extent. Considering the dynamic and uncertain nature of vehicular scenarios, we apply the IRL algorithm to environments with constantly changing parameters. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of IRL, significantly improving the generalization and interpretability of intelligent models in vehicular networks.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2024.3506161","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2702301); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271324,62231020,62394335,62371309); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:ZDSYS20220527171400002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767282","Active inference;prior knowledge;reinforcement learning;resource allocation","Reinforcement learning;Vehicle dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Resource management;Biological system modeling;Adaptation models;Decision making;Transportation;Inference algorithms;Dynamic scheduling","","","","40","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intelligence will be implemented using feedback loops that should be almost isolated from each other implying loose coupling and fast convergence. We next focus on sustainability challenges, including network management, network security, and network hardware. Several approaches and algorithms are highlighted for the goal-directed distributed network management perspectives of 6G sustainability. Resource consumption in network security can be minimized with enabling sleep mode in idle times, moving towards software-based security functions instead of hardware-based systems, and rethinking of encryption techniques in view of sustainability through code optimization and load fragmentation.

As the basis of cabin pose measurement, the accuracy and robustness of cabin assembly image segmentation are particularly important. However, traditional image segmentation method based on RGB sensor is extremely susceptible to interference from the external environment, which greatly weakens the recognition effect. In this article, an image segmentation method of cabin assembly scene based on improved red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) Mask R-CNN is proposed, and its network structure is designed to be able to specifically process four-channel images. The method can accurately extract the corresponding area of the cabin under complex and severe environmental disturbances, with high robustness and generalization capability. Meanwhile, the excellence of deep learning segmentation algorithms with depth channel information input is highlighted. In experiments, improved classic segmentation network U-Net, SegNet, pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), and Deeplab-v3 based on RGB-D were constructed as control, and these models were tested and evaluated on the enhanced test sets to verify their segmentation accuracy and robustness performance. Comparing experiments fully demonstrate the superiority of the segmentation network model of RGB-D four-channel input over RGB input.

With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) further entitle the systems to complex and coherent conversational interactions. These systems would be of great help in language education as it involves developing skills in communication, which, however, drew relatively less attention. Additionally, due to the complicated cognitive development at younger ages, more endeavors are needed for practical uses. Scaffolding refers to a teaching technique where teachers provide support and guidance to students for learning and developing new concepts or skills. It is an effective way to support diverse learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. In this work, we investigate how pedagogical instructions facilitate the scaffolding in ITSs, by conducting a case study on guiding children to describe images for language learning. We construct different types of scaffolding tutoring systems grounded in four fundamental learning theories: knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, dialogic teaching, and zone of proximal development. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, we build and refine a seven-dimension rubric to evaluate the scaffolding process. In our experiment on GPT-4V, we observe that LLMs demonstrate strong potential to follow pedagogical instructions and achieve self-paced learning in different student groups.

Predicting a person's facial expression accurately not only helps you understand their emotional state but also gives you greater control over how you engage with them. Since personalised interactions are shown to enhance development and rapport., this ability to autonomously recognise human facial emotions has tremendous promise in fields like finance and education. In this study., we provide a new method for identifying human emotions based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This method departs from conventional approaches by harnessing the potential of modern machine learning methods that make use of face datasets. When implemented in the TensorFlow framework., this method might significantly alter the way grammatical constructions are understood. Convolutional Neural Networks are at the core of our technique since they are a complicated design that can easily deal with complex picture data. We overcome the limits of previous methods by using CNNs to extract complex characteristics from face photos, which we access by abandoning traditional paradigms. To ensure the efficacy of our approach., we ran trials using the Facial Expression Recognition Challenge (FERC-2013) Dataset., a collection of 32 thousand different human faces. Surprisingly., our method achieved classification rates over 65%., demonstrating its efficiency in deciphering human emotions across a wide range of photos. Our approach is built on the incorporation of the AlexNet Architecture., a powerful algorithm that acts as the process”s conductor. One interesting feature is that it can be trained in batches., which speeds up the learning process and requires less resources. This effectiveness not only aids in faster learning., but also makes the method more widely applicable. Our work essentially advances facial emotion identification into the cutting edge of machine learning., which might have far-reaching applications across many different fields. Our method allows for more accurate and autonomous expression decoding., which opens the door to more nuanced interactions and promotes development and better communication across fields from finance to education.","","979-8-3503-4233-8","10.1109/ICTACS59847.2023.10389867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10389867","Emotion recognition;Deep learning;Self-learning;Neural networks;Machine learning;Facial expression analysis;Affective computing","Training;Emotion recognition;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Finance;Solids","","14","","23","IEEE","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we view the user-item interactions in a positive unlabeled (PU) learning setting and reconstruct the interaction matrix between users and warm items, detecting missing links and recommending warm items to existing users. Second, an inductive multi-target regressor is trained on this reconstructed interaction matrix and subsequently predicts interactions for new items that enter the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a two-step PU learning method is proposed to address the cold-start problem in recommender systems. To evaluate the proposed approach, we employed four benchmark datasets from movie and news recommendation domains with explicit and implicit feedback.

However, traditional one-size-fits-all leadership approaches often fall short in addressing the diverse needs and preferences of modern workforces. This paper proposes an innovative framework that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor leadership styles and interventions for optimal employee engagement and performance. The proposed framework integrates advanced AI algorithms with comprehensive data analytics to gain deep insights into employee behaviors, preferences, and performance indicators. Through this data-driven approach, organizations can develop a nuanced understanding of individual and collective employee needs, motivations, and aspirations. Based on these insights, AI algorithms can generate personalized recommendations for leadership styles and interventions tailored to specific teams or individuals. For example, the AI system may suggest adaptive leadership strategies that vary based on factors such as personality traits, job roles, and work preferences. Furthermore, the framework facilitates continuous monitoring and optimization of leadership interventions by analyzing real-time feedback and performance metrics. This iterative process enables leaders to adapt their approaches in response to changing circumstances and emerging trends, ensuring sustained employee engagement and performance improvement over time. The implementation of AI-powered leadership customization offers several potential benefits for organizations.

This analysis goes beyond simple positive or negative sentiment and delves into the nuances of viewer reactions, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the emotional impact of ads. With this information, advertisers can make data-driven decisions to optimize their advertising strategies, create more engaging content, and ultimately enhance the viewer experience. One of the challenges in sentiment analysis for viewer reaction analysis is the inherent subjectivity and variability of human emotions. Emotions can be complex and subjective, making it difficult to accurately capture and interpret them solely based on text or viewer feedback. Different individuals may perceive and express emotions differently, adding another layer of complexity to the analysis process. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of advanced deep learning model refinement. Overcoming these challenges can provide valuable insights into viewer reactions, enabling advertisers and content creators to create more engaging and impactful ad-supported video content. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based sentiment analysis is introduced to analyze the viewer's reaction while watching the ad in the video content. Here, an efficient model named Trans-Long Short-Term Memory (Trans-LSTM) is developed to perform the sentiment analysis. The developed Trans-LSTM is helpful in supervising the emotional data in the online video content and identifying the popularity of the corresponding video. The suggested model effectively analyzes the reviewer’s actions while watching all types of video content. Finally, the experimental analysis is performed to find the effectiveness of the developed sentiment analysis model via various metrics.","","979-8-3503-5434-8","10.1109/ICBDS61829.2024.10837427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837427","Decoding Sentiments;Understanding Viewer Reactions on Ad-Supported Video Content;Artificial Intelligence;Trans-Long Short Term Memory","Measurement;Deep learning;Analytical models;Sentiment analysis;Logistic regression;Memory management;Emotional responses;Decoding;Security;Artificial intelligence","","","","17","IEEE","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the present, mental health has emerged as one of the most important yet neglected facets of a person’s entire well-being. Though mental health chatbots are up and coming, there is still a need for a cost-effective, reliable, and interactive system. Stress and anxiety are two of the few factors that damage mental health. A person with mental health issues may suffer negative outcomes if sufficient care is not provided. Nowadays, with advancements in technology, one can use a computer to foretell the start of such mental health issues. Despite the fact that numerous academics have examined a range of methods for predicting depression, they frequently depend solely on the use of facial expressions, which, because they are subtle and small, can alter the performance of the model. Therefore, using more elements like textual analysis and emotion detection can help increase accuracy. In this study, a method for predicting mental health status using facial expression and sentiment analysis results is introduced. Through emotion detection and text data characterising the user’s mood, the suggested system replicates a one-on-one conversation between the user and the chatbot. Emotional detection and textual analysis are two features that can help predict mental health states more accurately. The suggested chatbot uses cutting-edge technology to analyse the user’s mood using a variety of inputs and offer suggestions for managing the feeling.","","979-8-3503-8681-3","10.1109/ICITIIT61487.2024.10580805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10580805","Artificial neural network;Convolution neural network;Web scraping;Natural language Processing;Machine learning","Emotion recognition;Sentiment analysis;Mood;Mental health;Artificial neural networks;Learning (artificial intelligence);Predictive models","","2","","20","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following feature extraction, LSTM was estimated the initial battery life. To further refine the prediction accuracy, CNN was introduced to serve as a discriminator, evaluating the prediction outcomes produced by the LSTM. According to the feedback of the discriminator, the training parameters of the combination of LSTM and improved gated convolutional layer are constantly updated to generate higher quality data to train the discriminator's recognition ability. Through comparative experiments, the accuracy of this method in battery life prediction is verified. Furthermore, we conducted ablation experiments to assess how the enhanced gated convolutional layers impact the performance of generative adversarial networks in predicting time series data.

It is necessary to propose a recommendation proposition that better meets the user's privacy protection needs, focusing on security thinking centered on user privacy. Using the dynamic evolution of the development of Federated Recommendation System (FedRecs), a theoretical analysis framework is developed based on the internal logic of privacy protection, which explains the development mechanism of FedRecs that is generated jointly by the federated learning mechanisms and privacy defense mechanisms involving users and service providers. Further, explores the possibility of moving towards the high-quality development goal of FedRecs from the perspective of privacy attack and defense changes and practical interpretations of FedTRecs. The purpose of the development of FedRecs is to provide users with recommendation services that meet expected standards and are committed to continuously improving recommendation quality and enhancing user satisfaction.

The recommendation systems represent a specialized type of information filtering mechanisms designed to improve the quality of search outcomes by suggesting items that are highly related to user queries or aligned with their historical interactions. This research uses demographic filtering for a recommending popular and well rated movies to users with similar demographic backgrounds irrespective of genre or other parameters. The methodology used in this paper computes pairwise similarity scores for all movies based on the parameter of descriptions and recommend movies to the users based on that similarity score. TF * IDF is used to calculate the relative frequency that is the importance of the words in description. It vectorizes the object to generate TDF-IDF matrix of plots of movies. Cosine similarity is applied to find similarities between each pair of movies. The above approach generates a matrix in which each column represents a movie and each column has a word from the overview vocabulary that appear in at least one document. This is practiced to decrease the value of words that occur frequently in plot description, and hence reduces their impact in calculating the final similarity score. Demographic and content-based filtering is used for recommendation in this paper, while demographic filtering provides a very fundamental method for recommendation and cannot be used practically, whereas content-based filtering is more advanced and powerful.","","979-8-3315-1795-3","10.1109/ICAIQSA64000.2024.10882441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10882441","Natural Language Processing (NLP);Demographic Filtering;Content Based Filtering;Cosine - Similarity;TDF-IDF vectorizer;TDF-IDF matrix","Measurement;Vocabulary;Quantum computing;Filtering;Motion pictures;User experience;Natural language processing;Reliability;Indexes;Recommender systems","","","","26","IEEE","21 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of artificial intelligence, learning-based control methods are emerging as promising alternatives. These methods require a tremendous amount of training data to achieve acceptable performances. However, the data collection process is costly or inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a parallel learning-based steering control method. Specifically, we first build a neural network (NN) based trajectory generative model (GeneratingNN) based on limited steering-trajectory raw data. The GeneratingNN can efficiently generate sufficient steering-trajectory data by enumerating the allowable steering actions sequences. Then, based on the raw data and generated data, we train another NN (RecallingNN) to learn the inverse mapping relationship between steering actions and trajectories. Hence, the RecallingNN can efficiently recall appropriate steering actions once given the previewed trajectory points. In addition, to further enhance the control accuracy and robustness, we use a simple feedback controller to handle the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. Testing results validate that the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy, stability and computational efficiency.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2022.3173448","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B0909050003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9772321","Autonomous driving;learning based control;parallel learning;steering control","Vehicle dynamics;Trajectory;Data models;Training data;Autonomous vehicles;Training;Predictive models","","40","","42","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blockchain is a complex and secure distributed ledger system that stores data with other information such as timestamp, and hash value in a block, and each block is connected with the other. With the help of blockchain technology, many problems can be solved. After conceptualizing blockchain technology, it has changed many sectors, such as health, education, and business, as well as human resource management (HRM). However, still, there are some gaps in this area. So in this paper, we are going to investigate and solve those. Hiring employees is a vital role of the human resource (HR) but it is not so easy to hire the right candidate. To hire the right candidate, checking the performance appraisals of his previous organization is a great method to know about him. HR often needs to know the candidate's performance appraisals from his previous organization as feedback, which is not as easy and trustworthy as the traditional way. A performance appraisal is a systematic way to review or evaluate an employee's organizational performance. This could be an incredible, reliable system for an organization's HR. In this paper, a blockchain-based performance appraisal system will be used to check the performance of an employee of a previous organization. This system will be trustworthy, secure, and anonymous.","","978-1-6654-9045-0","10.1109/STI56238.2022.10103234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103234","Blockchain;Human resource management;Smart Contracts;Smart recruitment system;Ethereum","Technological innovation;Systematics;Organizations;Machine learning;Decentralized applications;Blockchains;Appraisal","","5","","24","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations.

Countering hate speech is crucial as it mitigates harmful effects, supports victims, and promotes a more inclusive and respectful online environment. Existing methods for countering hate speech, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques and human moderation, are quick to implement but often infringe on freedom of speech and provoke resistance. Additionally, counterspeech generation methods, while maintaining a balance of freedom of speech, often lack systematic and strategic effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MAPM, a Multi-Agent Parallel Management Method, for strategic planning and decision-making in countering hate speech on social media. MAPM leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to construct a multi-agent decision-making framework and optimizes strategy planning through reinforcement learning. Furthermore, parallel systems create artificial virtual environments that interact with real systems, enabling multi-round iterations of counteractions and enhancing effectiveness through co-evolution and closed-loop feedback. Extensive experiments on hate speech datasets demonstrate that MAPM achieves excellent performance, providing a robust and adaptive solution for mitigating the impact of hate speech while supporting freedom of expression.","","979-8-3503-4925-2","10.1109/DTPI61353.2024.10778840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10778840","Hate speech;Large Language model;parallel Systems","Systematics;Social networking (online);Hate speech;Decision making;Refining;Virtual environments;Reinforcement learning;Strategic planning;Natural language processing;Speech processing","","","","22","IEEE","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most existing person re-id methods under intelligent monitoring cannot solve some problems in the real world, such as occlusion and background cluster. In this article, we propose an adaptive relation attention (ARA) network for person re-id based on the ARA mechanism, which can address the abovementioned challenges effectively. The ARA module consists of relation branch and adaption branch. Relation branch captures the global structural information by mining relation among feature nodes. Adaption branch generates dynamic weights for attention features that relation branch produced. Our constructed intelligent IoB system can acquire the behavior status of pedestrian at different times and places, providing corresponding feedback rapidly. Data transmission and storage in our system are built in a decentralized way, which is based on blockchain.

In the current Internet of Vehicles system, the traffic management center can learn from the feedback information of all vehicles to improve the ability of decision-making and traffic command. However, the existing feedback mechanism does not respond to the spatial-temporal characteristics of data in time, due to the lack of communication capability of the current equipment. So, it cannot meet the requirements of ultra-low delay, high reliability and high security in the Internet of Vehicles. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based proxy vote and revocation scheme for decision feedback in Internet of Vehicles, which allows the intelligent system to ignore the unevenness and heterogeneity in the 6G technology. In addition, blockchain technology notarizes the vote data of vehicles and outsources microservices. Secondly, we use the attributes of decision-related nodes instead of their identities to enable anonymous vote. Smart contracts can automatically expand the scalability of outsourced microservices. Finally, the security proof of the proposed scheme ensures the security and consistency of outsourced microservices.

However, this potential is currently far from realized because doing so requires significant investment and expertise as compared to more traditional educational activities. Additionally, game learning analytics continue to be a costly and fragile process. We propose a combination of tools that greatly reduces the associated costs of building serious games with meaningful analytics simplifying the validation of those games and their deployment in real settings.

To increase the productivity in inventory management, a well-organized cooperative path control is required to transport goods to the designated picking stations. In this paper, we propose a QMIX-based scheme for the cooperative path control of multiple AGVs. Although QMIX is the one of popular cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, we find that QMIX alone was not enough to increase productivity in warehouse systems. So, we develop two novel techniques that can be used with QMIX: 1) sequential action masking that eliminates all the collision cases and 2) additional local loss that improves collaboration of individual AGVs. They help to encourage the AGVs to cooperate more for high productivity. By extensive simulations, we present the superiority of the proposed scheme on several layouts in fulfillment centers. The effect of cooperation among AGVs in the proposed scheme is verified through the comparison study with the existing algorithms.

Environmental observation, home surveillance, and assistive supports are now built on wearable devices using inertia-based sensors, such as accelerometers, linear acceleration, and gyroscopes. However, previous assisted living system (ALS) still faces challenges in energy management and resource allocation when performing daily activities, particularly with ambulation. Legacy systems cannot fully improve self-esteem, hence, WearROBOT, which detects rearview obstacles and has an audio feedback system incorporated for voicing out once an obstacle is detected. Linear programing (LP) multi-commodity graph (LMCG) learning model is proposed while coupling the shortest path resource allocation for space diversity linearization. An Infrared sensor problem function that minimizes link utilization is derived. Angle-Intensity analysis (AIA) was carried out on various use case scenarios to enable the user to know the best angle to consider depending on its usage and battery conservation. This work showed how intensity differs at various angles of 5°, 15°, 20°, 35°, and 45°. Also, the reflectivity of different materials and how it affects the battery life are studied.

In this new paradigm, AI frameworks such as Ten-sorFlow and PyTorch play a key role, which is as essential as the compiler for traditional programs. It is known that the lack of a proper semantics for programming languages (such as C), i.e., a correctness specification for compilers, has contributed to many problematic program behaviours and security issues. While it is in general hard to have a correctness specification for compilers due to the high complexity of programming languages and their rapid evolution, we have a unique opportunity to do it right this time for neural networks (which have a limited set of functions, and most of them have stable semantics). In this work, we report our effort on providing a correctness specification of neural net-work frameworks such as TensorFlow. We specify the semantics of almost all TensorFlow layers in the logical programming language Prolog. We demonstrate the usefulness of the semantics through two applications. One is a fuzzing engine for TensorFlow, which features a strong oracle and a systematic way of generating valid neural networks. The other is a model validation approach which enables consistent bug reporting for TensorFlow models.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510112","National Research Foundation, Singapore; National University of Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794011","AI frameworks;AI libraries;deep learning models;semantics;specification;test case generation;model validation;AI model generation","Deep learning;Computer languages;Program processors;Systematics;Semantics;Computer bugs;Neural networks","","","","45","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, constructing the optimal A-Cells for a given OWC network, including determining the appropriate number of A-Cells associated to their contained UEs, is deeply integrated with the UEs’ distribution and transmission conditions. To address the intractable issue, in this paper, we conceive an adaptive UC-OWC network that relies on a feedback-guided iterative framework, which is capable of jointly optimizing A-Cells formation, modulation-mode assignment and power allocation strategies. For the sake of attaining the optimized throughput of this adaptive network, we initialize the UC association by the designed k-means based genetic algorithm (KGA), which can then be iteratively adjusted based on the throughput feedback obtained via our proposed multi-user cross Q-learning (MUCQ) resource allocation algorithm.

Methods used for scene generation and rendering usually fail to incorporate user interactions in real time, leading to resource inefficiency and reduced user experience. This paper proposes a new, all-in-one model that integrates CycleGAN, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Vision Transformer (ViT), Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), and Adaptive Feedback Learning (AFL-RT) in an attempt at dynamic optimization of the scene rendering based on user behavior and environmental data. The CycleGAN module ensures the production of the high-resolution scenes even from low-resolution inputs, whereas PPO provides for continuous adaptation of rendering parameters so as to reduce latency and computational load. ViT uses attention-based rendering, providing better visualization to user-centric areas, and BYOL does self-supervised scene understanding and compression, maintaining important information though reducing the bandwidth usage. AFL-RT is actually a closed-loop feedback system used to refine rendering parameters in real-time by actually reflecting the user’s preference and interests. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model reduces latency by as much as 30% in rendering, improves visual fidelity by up to 15%, and decreases energy consumption by 25% compared with the baseline methods. The user satisfaction also increases up to 25% regarding real-time adaptations by using this model, which only validates the practicality of such a model for dynamic, interactive metaverse environments.

Emotional connection is the foundation of successful communication. Our words are enhanced in human-to-human interactions by emotional undertones, vocal specifics, and contextual interpretations. When correctly interpreted, these hidden signals open the door to empathy, understanding, and effective communication. However, this emotional depth is not addressed in human computer verbal interactions. The challenge is comparable to having a conversation in which the words are understood but the feelings are not. Our idea focuses on bridging this emotional divide. We introduce an innovative approach to human-computer vocal interactions using a blend of advanced Natural Language Processing and Fuzzy Logic-based Voice Sentiment Analysis. Because human emotions are naturally complex, we use fuzzy logic to extract nuanced sentiment scores from voice inputs. Both the content, which is obtained from NLP, and the tone, which is modified to either mirror or contradict the detected sentiment, are informed by these evaluations in the form of voice. This bonds people with AI not only through words but also through emotions. Such a system has broad applications, from emotionally intelligent virtual assistants to support lines and teletherapy solutions. By ensuring AI can not only understand but also respond aptly to human emotion, bringing AI one step closer to reality.","","979-8-3503-0570-8","10.1109/RMKMATE59243.2023.10368930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368930","NLP;Fuzzy Logic;Human-computer verbal interaction;Voice Sentimental Analysis","Human computer interaction;Fuzzy logic;Ethics;Sentiment analysis;Virtual assistants;Collaboration;Oral communication","","","","6","IEEE","3 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, accurately predicting yield in such systems is quite challenging due to complex interactions between crops. This study introduces an advanced methodology using integrated loss functions within an optimally driven Feedback Neural Network (FNN) approach to improve yield prediction in a pea-cucumber intercropping systems. Traditional models relying only on Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function often unable to capture the complexity of models, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, the advanced loss functions are introduced like Dynamic Margin Loss (DML), Risk-Adjusted Loss (RAL), Quantile Loss (QL), and Hybrid Agronomic Efficiency Loss (HAEL) along with three optimizers such as Adaptive Momentum (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and Adaptive delta (Adadelta). These loss functions incorporate risk, uncertainty, and agronomic efficiency into the model training process, enhances predictive capabilities and robustness. This proposed framework is able to capture the complexity of yield prediction by incorporating agricultural factors. While Gradient Boost Machines (GBM) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have some potential, they are not able to capture these dynamics. The sensitivity and weight analysis also focuses that HAEL targets important agronomic factors such as nitrogen uptake and residue biomass, which provide a holistic view of yield prediction. The proposed approach improves the predictive performance compared to traditional models and helps to identify the importance of features, which makes it an effective tool for decision making in sustainable agriculture. Selecting appropriate loss functions is essential to improve the accuracy and robustness of crops yield prediction models. Thus, study provides a strong foundation for enhancing yield prediction in intricate intercropping systems, which all significantly enhance the advancement of precision agriculture.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3486101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10745121","Smart agriculture;pea-cucumber intercropping;yield prediction;artificial neural network;long short term memory;loss functions","Predictive models;Accuracy;Crop yield;Biological system modeling;Adaptation models;Prediction algorithms;Deep learning;Propagation losses;Decision making;Soil measurement","","1","","64","CCBYNCND","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, current IBN approaches consider that users require expertise in some formal and technical models (e.g., Network Service Descriptors - NSDs) to define these Intents, necessitating substantial effort. A natural progression of IBN systems is to define Intents using natural language instead of structured models. However, dealing with this becomes challenging due to the unstructured and ambiguous nature of natural language. Fortunately, Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very powerful in understanding human language, making them well-suited for this task. This paper proposes an LLM-based Intent translation system that allows users to express Intents in natural language, which the system subsequently converts into NSDs. Moreover, we employ a Human Feedback (HF) loop that enables the system to learn from past experiences.

However, the service coverage is limited by the static servers. Therefore, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility are deployed as aerial base stations (BS) to assist ground users to offload the task and process the data on edge. In this article, we introduce a decentralized user allocation and dynamic service scheme to assign the UAV deployment for a multi-UAV MEC system, which incorporates the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology into a two-layer training framework. The continuous action, including the UAV trajectory and bit allocation of offloading, is first optimized in the lower layer, while the upper one concentrates on the discrete action space for the user allocation. In particular, we develop a constraint reward function that considers the communication quality in the lower layer to accomplish efficient communication. The well-trained neural network is embedded in the upper layer to provide rapid feedback for the upper environment.

These impacts encompass the theft of confidential information, service interruptions, and expenses tied to breach remediation, underscoring the urgent necessity for strengthened cybersecurity strategies. Machine learning (ML) is highly effective in signifying cybersecurity standards, leveraging large-scale data analysis, pattern recognition, and adaptability to emerging threats. Unlike other traditional methods such as rule-based that relay on predefined criteria. This study presents an automated ML framework to recommend cybersecurity standards, audits, and compliance measures, enhancing and monitoring cybersecurity infrastructure systematically. Nine cybersecurity standards, including seven international (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001:2022, NIST, CIS) and two national standards (UAE, KSA), were analyzed using data from official sources. Data preprocessing addressed duplicates and missing values, with validation via Pearson Correlation and Chi-square tests (Chi-square = 55.79, p = 0.0017). Attributes were extracted using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique and refined through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). A content-based filtering (CBF) recommender system, aligned with organizational maturity levels, was developed and enhanced with a feedback loop for user insights. The recommendation model was validated across three organizational growth scenarios: ad-hoc, managed, and adaptive. The UAE standard recommended 158 controls for Scenario-1, while KSA led in Scenario-2. We evaluate the performance of the model using 3-ML classifiers including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Model performance was assessed using the F1 score and ROC AUC score. Testing in ad-hoc, managed, and adaptive scenarios showed the UAE standard recommended 158 controls for Scenario-1, while KSA led Scenario-2. The RF classifier achieved 81% accuracy and an ROC AUC score of 0.98. This framework supports alignment with global standards, enhances cybersecurity governance, and enables ongoing cybersecurity maturity tracking, aiding resilience and improving GCI rankings.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3524496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818625","Cybersecurity;critical infrastructures;cyber threats;risk assessment;machine learning;recommender system;standards;natural language processing;global cyber index;compliance","Computer security;Security;Organizations;Critical infrastructure;Computer crime;Recommender systems;Natural language processing;Medical services;Feature extraction;Ransomware","","","","80","CCBY","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is becoming increasingly difficult for scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipment to accurately find defects. In addition, a lot of costs is required for image collection, learning, and classification to increase defect detection accuracy. In this study, we proposed a novel volumetric representation learning to perform 3D wafer handling in the Wafer Pattern Recognition (WPR) framework. The proposed method generates a 3D representation using a structure generator and pseudo-rendering and then performs appropriate pattern recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the 3D representation shows competitive performance compared to the existing model with a performance difference of 2% to 22% based on the F-score compared to the 2D image. Also, in terms of the same cost, it is expected that it will lead to better performance if we can overcome the limitations of 2D and consider the increase in cost for 3D models.

Recently, some techniques propose to train deep learning (DL) models to predict the branch coverage of an arbitrary input owing to its always-available gradients etc. as a guide. Those techniques have proved their success in improving coverage and discovering bugs under different experimental settings. However, DL models, usually as a magic black-box, are notoriously lack of explanation. Moreover, their performance can be sensitive to the collected runtime coverage information for training, indicating potentially unstable performance. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on 4 types of DL models across 6 projects to (1) revisit the performance of DL models on predicting branch coverage (2) demystify what specific knowledge do the models exactly learn, (3) study the scenarios where the DL models can outperform and underperform the traditional fuzzers, and (4) gain insight into the challenges of applying DL models on fuzzing. Our empirical results reveal that existing DL-based fuzzers do not perform well as expected, which is largely affected by the dependencies between branches, unbalanced sample distribution, and the limited model expressiveness. In addition, the estimated gradient information tends to be less helpful in our experiments. Finally, we further pinpoint the research directions based on our summarized challenges.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3200525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882384","Coverage;deep learning;fuzzing;mutation;testing","Fuzzing;Predictive models;Deep learning;Data models;Computational modeling;Training data;Training","","3","","","IEEE","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A novel human and animal classification through single-receiver and dual-receiver mmWave radar at 77 GHz is presented. The system uses feedback signal responses from targets with dual-receiver mmWave radar and classifies human and animal features using a convolution neural network (CNN) based on synthetic 2D Tensor data. The performance is compared to the classification result using a deep learning and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) from a single mmWave radar dataset under the measurement distance and number of objects.

The Aeronautical Ad-hoc Networks (AANETs) take the attention of both industry and academia to satisfy this connectivity requirement with the low cost, easy deployment, and continuous coverage features. On the other hand, the ultra-dynamic characteristics of AANET with unstructured topology make its environment hard-to-follow. Here, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodologies have an essential role in handling the management complexity of this hard-to-follow environment. However, these methodologies increase the computational complexity of aircraft due to the continuous update, convergence time, and scalability issues. At that point, we propose the utilization of the Digital Twin (DT) technology to handle the management complexity of AANET while solving the main issues of AI-based methodologies on it. The DT can virtually replicate the physical AANET components through closed-loop feedback in real-time. Therefore, this work introduces the utilization of DT technology for the AANET orchestration and, accordingly, proposes a DT-enabled AANET (DT-AANET) topology management framework. This framework consists of the Physical AANET Twin and Controller, including Digital AANET Twin with Operational Module. Here, the Digital AANET Twin virtually represents the physical environment while the operational module executes the AI-based computations on them through unsupervised learning-based training or supervised learning-based prediction.

Dual-arm manipulation tasks are always difficult to program in advance, and then, executed autonomously by the robots. Learning from demonstration is an efficient programming method for robots that can transfer human skills to robots. However, conventional skill learning methods, e.g., dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) can only characterize the motion information of each dimension independently, and cannot take into account the relationship between multidimensional information. Participially, flipping manipulation is quite common in industry production lines, but it has not been well addressed yet to provide a robotics solution to this task. In this article, we propose an improved DMP model, called the object-level constrained DMP, which effectively preserves the association between multidimensional information. Similarly, we also propose an orientation generalization method for the flipping task. In addition, we show how to demonstrate the flipping task via a teleoperation system.

Most algorithms deployed operate based on a set of predefined rules which hinders their ability to perform optimally across diverse traffic conditions. Recent studies applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to VSL control problems have shown promising results. However, none of the existing MARL frameworks comply with real-world requirements imposed by most traffic agencies across the United States. In this work, we propose MARVEL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement-learning for large-scale Variable spEed Limits), a novel MARL framework for large-scale VSL highway control with real-world deployment capabilities. MARVEL only relies on sensing information available in most real-world settings and learns through a reward structure that incorporates three abstract goals to ensure reasonable behaviors under different traffic conditions. Through parameter sharing among all VSL agents, the proposed framework scales to cover corridors equipped with multiple VSL gantries. The policies are trained in a microscopic traffic simulation environment, focusing on a short freeway stretch with 8 VSL agents spanning 7 miles. For testing, these policies are applied to a more extensive network with 34 VSL agents spanning 17 miles of Interstate 24 (I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee, the United States. MARVEL improves traffic safety by 63.4% compared to the no-control scenario and enhances traffic mobility by 58.6% compared to a state-of-the-practice algorithm that has been deployed on I-24.

However, the software-based foundation of SD-WANs opens the door to new attack vectors that target software vulnerabilities, a threat that was not an issue in traditional networks. Furthermore, given the scale of such networks and the large number of services they offer, SD-WANs do not limit the attacker’s access to publicly accessible information that can lead to successful coordinated attacks.In this white paper, we introduce a game-based theoretic approach that operates on open-source intelligence-based information gathering to model potential attack scenarios and drive a proactive moving target defense technique to prevent potential exploitation of SD-WANs.

However, current studies on Time Series IDS classifier involve additional RNN-LSTM layers and multiple gates to optimize the training and feedback process. Notwithstanding, RNN-LSTM has powerful features to memorize data sequences. The nature of multiple complex hidden states in RNN-type model requires intensive training or epoch to achieve optimized loss function. This paper aims to go beyond conventional deep learning model by removing complex gated states and conventional hidden layers. The goal is to create an optimized adaptive time series classifier. The model leverages various fitting algorithms which include Sinusoidal, Linear, Power Function, Taylor Series and a new “Staircase” function that is introduced in this study. These functions adapt gradually to the real-time target distribution pattern. This will eliminate the need for feedback process to optimize hyperparameters. The model’s performance is evaluated against the realistic benchmarked IDS dataset; a dataset that simulates recent malware attacks and has imbalanced distribution property. This property reflects a realistic low cyber-attack footprint.

Early approaches relied on utilizing each user’s first-order social neighbors’ interests for better user modeling, and failed to model the social influence diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we propose a preliminary work of a neural influence Diffusion Network (i.e., DiffNet) for social recommendation L. Wu, P. Sun, Y. Fu, R. Hong, X. Wang, and M. Wang, “A neural influence diffusion model for social recommendation,” in Proc. Int. ACM SIGIR Conf. Res. Develop. Inf. Retrieval, 2019, pp. 235–244.. DiffNet models the recursive social diffusion process for each user, such that the influence diffusion hidden in the higher-order social network is captured in the user embedding process. Despite the superior performance of DiffNet, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion process in the social network would neglect the latent collaborative interests of users hidden in the user-item interest network. To this end, in this paper, we propose DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting both the higher-order user latent interest reflected in the user-item graph and higher-order user influence reflected in the user-user graph for user embedding learning. This is achieved by iteratively aggregating each user’s embedding from three aspects: the user’s previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.

This app allows users to browse and purchase products from the company’s online store. To develop this app, the company would use a combination of Scrum and Lean UX methodologies. Scrum provides a structured framework for the development team to work in short sprints, delivering working software every few weeks. During each sprint, the team would work on a set of user stories related to specific features of the app. For instance, the team could focus on features such as search functionality, product listing, or the checkout process. Within each sprint, the team could use Lean UX practices to quickly create low-fidelity prototypes and gather feedback from users through usability testing. Based on the feedback, the team could then iterate on the design, making changes as necessary to improve the user experience. AI would play a crucial role in this app by using machine learning algorithms to analyse user behaviour and provide personalized product recommendations. The AI would learn from each user’s past interactions with the app and other data sources such as purchase history, social media activity, and browsing behaviour. The recommendations would be displayed in real time as the user interacts with the app, providing a personalized and relevant experience. By combining Agile UX, e-commerce, and AI, the company can create a mobile app that provides a seamless and personalized e-commerce experience for its users. The agile approach allows the team to work quickly and adapt to changing user needs, while the AI improves the user experience by providing personalized recommendations and enhancing the overall usability of the app. In summary, this example demonstrates how the combination of Agile UX, e-commerce, and AI can be used to create a highly effective mobile app that meets the needs of users in a rapidly evolving market.

In this paper, we first design a multi-scale feedback module (MF) that extracts multi-scale features and alleviates the information loss in network propagation. We further propose a novel multi-scale feedback network (MSF-Net) for guided depth map super-resolution, which can better extract and refine the features by sequentially joining MF blocks. Specifically, our MF block uses parallel sampling layers and feedback links between multiple time steps to better learn information at different scales. Moreover, an inter-scale attention module (IA) is proposed to adaptively select and fuse important features at different scales. Meanwhile, depth features and corresponding color features are interacted using cross-domain attention conciliation module (CAC) after each MF block.

We develop the Patient Portal Engagement Framework (PPEF) to objectively and systematically evaluate patient portal engagement and demonstrated its utilization and effectiveness in two scenarios: portal utilization and user feedback. Four engagement levels included in the PPEF are - Inform Patients that allows patients to access health information; Involve Patients that encourages patients to take initiatives; Partner with Patients that supports long-term collaboration between patients and providers; and Support Ecology of Care that extends the scope beyond hospitals into personal and social factors. We find more portal utilization and user feedback focus in lower levels of patient portal engagement (i.e., patients receiving information and taking active actions in managing care). Our thematic analysis of online user reviews reveals four core themes: conflicts between system and user views, evolving benefits and needs towards patient portals, debates about balancing emotional and informational needs, and reconsideration of power, accessibility, and privacy. We discuss how PPEF can help harvest and synthesize data from the system and user levels, as well as the design implications for patient portals.

The effectiveness of learned CSI compression has been proven experimentally in many previous works, but less attention was paid to the importance of scalability in practice to support variable sizes of feedback payloads. In this paper, we propose employing multi-stage vector quantization (VQ) to provide progressive variable-rate CSI compression. In particular, VQ is cascaded to find a series of low-dimensional CSI representations, which provides progressively refined approximations associated with variable feedback rates. In practice, deploying a dedicated model with a separate codebook optimized for each rate requirement is prominently challenging in the aspects of storage, on-device compiling, if needed, and model life-cycle management. To tackle this challenge, we develop a single network model with multi-stage codebooks, which is learned for various compression rates of interest jointly. Moreover, we propose employing sequential training to aid joint training by providing good initialization of network parameters with transfer learning. The simulation results shows the effectiveness of the proposed model and training method, which establish a promising design methodology of AI-enabled CSI compression.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-9054-9","10.1109/ICC51166.2024.10622937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10622937","","Training;Vector quantization;Simulation;Scalability;Design methodology;Transfer learning;Rate-distortion","","","","9","IEEE","20 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods of assessing meat freshness and species classification, such as manual inspection, are often inefficient and prone to error. This paper introduces a novel Internet of Things (IoT) system that integrates gas sensors and advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning, to address these issues effectively. The system combines image-based classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with gas sensor data to provide a comprehensive, real-time solution for the classification of both beef and mutton in terms of species and freshness. The custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a dataset comprising 9,928 images, 6,672 of which were utilized for meat freshness classification and 3,256 for meat species classification. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 99%, surpassing the performance of other models, including ResNet-50, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). It is important to note that identical training and validation datasets were employed across all four models, ensuring a consistent and equitable comparison of their performance. The custom CNN showed a clear advantage in handling the complex image data, particularly in distinguishing between beef and mutton species as well as their freshness levels. The system incorporates three gas sensors—MQ135, MQ4, and MQ136—to detect gases such as ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which are released during the spoilage of meat. These gas sensor readings are utilized specifically for the classification of meat freshness. The system provides real-time feedback via LED indicators: green for fresh meat, yellow for meat that is neither fresh nor fully rotten, and red for spoiled meat. The results of the classification, based on both image data and gas readings, are displayed on an LED screen. This offers an efficient, scalable, and practical solution for real-time quality monitoring of beef and mutton. This integrated approach significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of meat safety management within the food supply chain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3520029","Department of Computer Science and Engineering; Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10806684","Classification;meat quality;MQ135 gas sensor;MQ136 gas sensor;MQ4 methane natural gas sensor;meat freshness;IoT","Deep learning;Accuracy;Convolutional neural networks;Internet of Things;Real-time systems;Nearest neighbor methods;Gas detectors;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Biological system modeling","","1","","50","CCBY","18 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, the challenge of making sequential decisions to optimize long-term benefits rather than short-term gains is often overlooked. Additionally, more apparent connections must be made between actions taken on one advertising channel and the outcomes on others. Furthermore, budget limitations narrow down the range of potential optimal strategies that can be pursued. In response to these challenges, this study unveils a pioneering multi-channel advertising budget allocation approach that leverages a reinforcement learning (RL) Q-learning framework enriched with an advanced Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to refine the Q-learning methodology. The RL element makes informed sequential decisions, adeptly adjusting strategies to favor long-term rewards by assimilating environmental feedback. Complementing this, the enhanced DE algorithm introduces an inventive clustering-based mutation technique, exploiting key groupings within the DE population to generate novel and practical solutions. The model is further bolstered by a discretization tactic aimed at simplifying the model by streamlining costs. The proposed methodology is rigorously validated using two extensive datasets: the Chinese Internet Company Advertising Dataset (CICAD) and CRITEO-UPLIFT v2, employing metrics like Area Under the Cost Curve (AUCC) and Expected Outcome Metric (EOM) as measures of performance. The empirical results affirm the superiority of the model, showcasing its exceptional performance with significant scores (AUCC =0.750 and EOM =0.736 for CICAD; AUCC =0.813 and EOM =0.829 for CRITEO-UPLIFT v2), thereby illustrating the model’s proficiency in navigating the multifaceted challenges associated with multi-channel budget allocation and establishing a new benchmark in the field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3429359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10599475","Budget allocation with constraint;marketing;social networks;reinforcement learning;differential evolution","Resource management;Advertising;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Costs;Q-learning;Complexity theory;Market research;Social networking (online);Reinforcement learning","","1","","55","CCBYNCND","16 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The target respondents were those who had some prior experience of using chatbots. Using SmartPLS-SEM, the study determines whether anthropomorphism, i.e., AIPHC system-specific and customer personality-specific dimensions, can improve chatbot usage in the insurance sector. The results show that anthropomorphism positively influenced optimism and innovativeness but negatively impacted discomfort and security. Further optimism and innovativeness favourably impact AIPHC adoption. Insecurity had a significant negative impact, while discomfort was insignificant for AIPHC adoption. The results could help us better understand how technological readiness and system-specific theories like anthropomorphism can be used in sectors like insurance. The results highlight chatbots’ potential to raise the quality of service, simplify processes, and enhance customers’ overall experiences in the insurance sector.","","979-8-3503-7462-9","10.1109/CCICT62777.2024.00068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596598","Chatbot;Artificial Intelligence-Powered Humanoid Chatbot;Technology Readiness Index (TRI);Anthropomorphism;Insurance Sector;Service Quality","Industries;Customer services;Insurance;Humanoid robots;Quality of service;Chatbots;Mathematical models","","","","29","IEEE","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, a traditional variable time headway model is improved considering the acceleration of the lead car. Secondly, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (lT2 FLC) is designed for the upper structure of the ACFC system to simulate the driver's operating habits. To reduce the nonlinear influence and improve the tracking accuracy for the desired acceleration, the control strategy of F+FPIF is given for the lower control structure. Thirdly, the lower control method proposed in this paper is compared with the fuzzy PI control and the traditional method (no lower controller for tracking desired acceleration) separately. Meanwhile, the proportion integration differentiation (PID), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), subsection function control (SFC) and type-l fuzzy logic control (Tl FLC) are respectively compared with the IT2 FLC in control performance under different scenes.

To this end, we design and implement ODTDS—an online drone-based target detection system that performs online data processing and autonomous navigation simultaneously with restricted resources. Specifically, to prolong detection durations with limited energy providing for continuous processing and flying, we develop an adaptive motion planner for autonomous and energy-efficient navigation.

Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to MIMO is expected to further boost the spectrum efficiency and capacity of MIMO for 5G-advanced and 6G, because more accurate Channel State Information (CSI) will be enabled via intelligent channel estimation and prediction. Low overhead CSI feedback is also possible when AI is utilized in the channel compression and recovery in frequency division duplex systems. However, designing separate AI models for channel estimation, prediction, and compression/recovery requires huge efforts in model training and large memory to store the model parameters. It is highly motivated to explore how to achieve accurate MIMO CSI with minimum AI model training and storage overhead for all the possible CSI related use cases. In this paper, a multi-modal learning framework is proposed for MIMO channel estimation, prediction, and compression. The framework consists of a single common feature extraction module used in all the use cases, followed by alight weight adaptation modules designed for different use cases.

In this study, we provide an innovative approach to music recommendation using facial expressions, with a focus on creating unique listening sessions for each individual user. The main goal is to provide a new approach to automate music playing based on the analysis of facial expressions. Most existing techniques either need human intervention, the use of wearable computers, or the categorization of aural features. We suggest instead that music be chosen and played automatically. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully used to the problem of emotion recognition. We use Pygame and T-Kinter to implement music suggestion. By implementing our proposed strategy, we anticipate a decrease in overall system costs and processing time, which will result in enhanced precision. We evaluate the efficacy of the system using the FER dataset, which captures facial expressions using an integrated camera. These facial images are then processed to identify different emotions, such as surprise, joy, anger, sorrow, and neutrality.

The recent decade has seen a boom in online learning resources, and during the pandemic, there has been an exponential rise of online teaching videos without much quality control. As a result, we are faced with two key challenges. First, how to decide which lecture videos are engaging to intrigue the listener and increase productivity, and second, how to automatically provide feedback to the content creator using which they could improve the content. The quality of the content could be improved if the creators could automatically get constructive feedback on their content. On the other hand, there has been a steep rise in developing computational methods to predict a user engagement score. In this paper, we have proposed a new unified model, CLEFT, that means “Contextualised unified Learning of user Engagement in video lectures with Feedback” that learns from the features extracted from freely available public online teaching videos and provides feedback on the video along with the user engagement score. Given the complexity of the task, our unified framework employs different pre-trained models working together as an ensemble of classifiers. Our model exploits a range of multi-modal features to model the complexity of language, context agnostic information, textual emotion of the delivered content, animation, speaker’s pitch, and speech emotions.

Subjects tried to counteract anxious and stressful states through NF, that is by decreasing the power in the beta band measured in the midline areas of the scalp. The assessment of the neurofeedback effectiveness was based on the use of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in combination with EEG. Therefore, EEG signal was exploited in real-time to guide the feedback and also in post processing, together with the HRV, to assess the effectiveness of the whole training. As the EEG signal is concerned, the results showed that the power in the beta band decreased within each session when the ER ability was strengthened, as reported in the literature. On the contrary, the HRV did not exhibit the expected increasing trend within each trial. When considering each the session on the whole, thus computing the HRV on a greater time interval, the HRV during the NF training is typically higher than the HRV computed during the rest and negative baseline phases.","","979-8-3503-0080-2","10.1109/MetroXRAINE58569.2023.10405699","Italian Ministry for Universities and Research(grant numbers:FIT4MEDROB,PNC0000007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10405699","Neurofeedkack;EEG;HRV;emotion regulation;surgery","Training;Scalp;Electroencephalography;Regulation;Neurosurgery;Noise measurement;Heart rate variability","","","","32","IEEE","1 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this goal, we integrate several approaches including: 1. using trained face detection model to capture face image from input. 2. training a high accurate 468-point landmark detection model with multiple face dataset. Based on the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) table, we categorize these landmarks into 13 groups of facial regions. These regions with specific emotion labels are used as our target units of AU (Action Unit) detection. 3. training CNN model to detect and analysis AUs from facial landmark data. 4. implying FACS to evaluate the facial expressions and emotions. and 5. using a straightforward GUI plotter to show the digitized emotions. The experiment results show that not only the primary emotion but also the secondary emotion of users in movies can be detected and evaluated successfully.

In recent years, machine learning-based transaction monitoring systems have successfully complemented traditional rule-based systems to reduce the high number of false positives and the effort needed to review all the alerts manually. Unfortunately, machine learning-based solutions also have disadvantages: while unsupervised models can detect novel anomalous patterns, they are usually characterized by a high number of false alarms; supervised models, instead, usually offers a higher detection rate but require a large amount of labeled data to achieve such performance. In this paper, we present Amaretto, an active learning framework for money laundering detection that combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to support the transaction monitoring processes by improving the detection performance and reducing the compliance management costs. Amaretto exploits novel selection strategies to target a subset of transactions for investigation, making more efficient use of the feedback provided by the analyst. We perform the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset provided by the industrial partner, which simulates the profiles of clients trading in international capital markets. We show that Amaretto outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by reducing money laundering risk and improving detection performance. In particular, we compare state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised techniques commonly used in the AML domain with the ones implemented in this work. We show that the Isolation and Random Forests of Amaretto perform best in the task under analysis, with an AUROC of 0.9 for the first (20% better on average) and a detection rate of 0.793 for the second (30 % better on average). In addition, they are characterized by lower investigation costs computed in terms of the daily number of transactions to be examined and the number of false positives and false negatives. Finally, we compare Amaretto against a state-of-the-art active learning fraud detection system, achieving better detection performances and lower costs in all the analyzed scenarios. Worth mentioning, Amaretto improves the detection rate up to 50 % and reduces the overall cost by 20% in the most realistic scenario under analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3167699","Napier Technologies Ltd; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758694","Active learning;anti-money laundering;financial systems;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;selection strategies","Costs;Monitoring;Data models;Task analysis;Investment;Anomaly detection;Analytical models","","16","","56","CCBY","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study addresses a more complex challenge than that of on-demand video streaming: enhancing service quality in multi-party, full-duplex communication scenarios, such as video conferences. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based video bitrate allocation framework for a media server in the video conferencing system. Our framework aims to increase overall QoS by applying an appropriate bitrate for each connection in a video conferencing call, considering the network conditions for users. We train the DRL model to maximize the aggregate QoS of users in a meeting by constructing a feedback loop between a media server and a DRL server. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework can adaptively control the video bitrate according to changes in network conditions. As a result, it achieves higher video bitrates in the user application (approximately, 5% under stable network conditions and 35% over the highly dynamic network conditions) compared to the existing rule-based bandwidth allocation.","2374-9709","979-8-3503-2793-9","10.1109/NOMS59830.2024.10575889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10575889","Video conferencing;Quality of Service;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Adaptive Bitrate Control","Bit rate;Quality of service;Bandwidth;Streaming media;Media;Dynamic scheduling;Deep reinforcement learning","","","","61","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Preventative medicines and telemedicine courses for treating these conditions are proliferating. The availability of secure and pleasurable alternatives continues to be of paramount importance. When it comes to monitoring and studying human health, inertial measurement units (IMU) are frequently viewed as the most objective and least intrusive alternative due to their ability to identify motion patterns with relative ease. Machine learning is commonly regarded as an effective method for analysing IMU data and identifying motion patterns. As part of a smart healthcare learning tool, we describe a deep learning-based technique for detecting human movements. An innovative hybrid adjectives-based on before-classification & multi-features analysis technique is created to classify human motion for usage in healthcare e-learning. To begin, a Kalman filter is used to do preliminary processing on the raw data from the IMUs. An experiment is conducted in which minimum and average gravity reduction techniques are used to the acceleration data. Signal segmentation has been used to data from a variety of time periods to establish which kind of segmentation is most effective. Then, we identify active as well as passive motion patterns to do a preliminary categorization. Both static and dynamic motion patterns have been analysed to recover characteristics. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to categorise the active and passive motion components of healthcare e-learning. We accomplished this using the wearable computing and REALDISP datasets. In experimental comparisons, our proposed method for intelligent health care learning surpassed the current state-of-the-art systems. Implementing the technique as recommended led to an accuracy of 87.35% for the REALDISP dataset & 85.18 on the wearable computers dataset. Furthermore, a smart healthcare advisor is provided with access to the classified motion sequences in order to provide immediate feedback on human health.","","979-8-3503-8891-6","10.1109/GCCIT63234.2024.10862392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10862392","Smart Healthcare Environment;Motion Detection;IMU Signals;CNN;and REALDISP Dataset","Electronic learning;Accuracy;Motion segmentation;Medical services;Feature extraction;Vectors;Pattern recognition;Convolutional neural networks;Wearable devices;Gravity","","","","19","IEEE","6 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a disruptive change, needed to switch to a carbon-neutral economy, requires rethinking both the economics and dynamics of power systems, knowing that the electric power sector is going digital. DER-driven uncertainties will impose costly operational margins and preventive measures based on solving very complex optimization problems. Keeping human operators in the loop to supervise actions can limit reaction time severely by making it difficult to respond in a timely manner when multiple control systems are required to stabilize the grid. The operator will hence need to be assisted by an artificial intelligence system trained at learning “good” decisions by imitating operators and assessing the associated operational risk. Hierarchical monitoring and control systems working in tandem with decentralized markets and resources will allow the true secure limits of decentralized, decarbonized, digitized, and democratized (4D) grids to be identified. This will be done with preventive/corrective actions executed in seconds while balancing grid cost versus safety, reliability, and stability.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPE.2022.3219179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10007664","","Uncertainty;System dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Power system dynamics;Switches;Power system stability;Control systems","","10","","7","IEEE","5 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Therefore, it is an urgent need to propose an unlicensed spectrum access method to guarantee the harmonious and efficient coexistence between cellular network technologies such as LTE and incumbent users such as WiFi in the unlicensed spectrum. However, existing coexistence schemes such as licensed assisted access (LAA) and LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) still suffer from inefficient spectrum utilization and unsatisfactory fairness. In the paper, we formulate the optimization problem of the unlicensed spectrum access among multiple small bases (SBSs) as a game, and then solve the Nash Equilibrium (NE) with cooperative and distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Specifically, a two level access framework for the coexistence scenario, which consists of feedback cycle and executive cycle, is first proposed, and then the key elements of MADRL including state, action, reward and Q-network are designed in detail based on the proposed access framework. To overcome the problems of learning divergence and prohibitive computation overhead in the coexistence scenario with multiple SBSs due to the non-stability phenomena, we adopt the mean field technology to solve the NE, which can simplify the process of solving NE by converting the interaction of an agent with the remaining multiple agents into an action with the average effect of them. Simulation results show that 1) the proposed algorithm can overcome the learning divergence problem and converge to the NE quickly, and 2) the proposed algorithm can achieve the bi-objective optimization of total throughput and fairness of the coexistence network, and can achieve better performance in terms of throughput and fairness compared with the baseline methods such as Cat-4 LBT, Cooperative LBT and Random schemes.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2022.3210955","NSFC(grant numbers:62071077,61971129); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021YFB2900300); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD20190929172545139); Cheng-Yu Building(grant numbers:KJCXZD2020026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913836","LAA;WiFi;network coexistence;mean field;deep reinforcement learning","Wireless fidelity;Throughput;Long Term Evolution;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Artificial intelligence;Wireless communication","","8","","45","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Artificial Intelligence-Based Traffic Signal Control for Urban Transportation Systems","M. He; P. Lake","Rutgers Preparatory School, USA; Rutgers Preparatory School, USA",2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"17 Sep 2024","2024","","","1","1","Extended Abstract Optimizing traffic signal control is crucial for the smooth operation of urban transportation systems. The challenge is to minimize vehicle delays and emissions, requiring a deep understanding of traffic dynamics at intersections. Traditional algorithms determined the number of vehicles stopping at an intersection by subtracting the flow of non-right-turning vehicles entering from the flow of vehicles exiting. Methods based on this are not taking the full dynamics of traffic behavior into consideration. Their performance is thus limited. Acknowledging the significance of this fundamental aspect, our research aims to introduce a novel algorithm. This innovative approach goes beyond conventional methods, integrating the dynamics of starting and stopping cars, with the goal of surpassing the limitations of previous solutions. Our work stems from the recognition of the pivotal role that efficient traffic signal control plays in urban transportation systems. With a focus on minimizing average vehicle delay within a specific timeframe, we aspire to make a meaningful contribution to the establishment of a sustainable and intelligent traffic management system. The motivation behind the project lies in the pursuit of a harmonious balance between rapid vehicle throughput and reduced environmental impact. Our approach involves designing a variety of solutions by blending traditional traffic engineering principles with our innovative algorithm. In the proposed model, history traffic data are used to train the traffic prediction for the future timeslots. Instantaneous intersection dynamics are also input into the model to trigger the parameter update and traffic prediction. This learn-and-predict AI process improves the model adaptation to changes. It tolerates local errors occurring in a short timeframe without sacrificing the overall performance. Prototyping plays a crucial role in testing and refining our approach. Using VISSIM software with AI methods, simulations have confirmed the effectiveness of our model. Additionally, community engagement activities, such as workshops and demonstrations, offer valuable real-world insights, influencing the development of our methodology. The prototype and simulations demonstrate promising results, highlighting a reduction in both average vehicle delay and the number of start-stop cycles. These findings align with our objectives of promoting efficient traffic flow and minimizing emissions. The positive feedback received during community engagement activities further confirms the real-world potential impact of our approach. The proposed algorithm can be refined based on additional real-world data. Collaborating with local authorities for potential implementation in select intersections is a key objective. The next phase will involve leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms to iteratively improve and evolve our model, ensuring it remains at the forefront of traffic signal optimization.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-5280-1","10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10665107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10665107","","Adaptation models;Heuristic algorithms;Transportation;Predictive models;Throughput;Software;Delays","","","","0","IEEE","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proactive wireless communication can facilitate minimal latency by open-loop communication, which discards traditional feedback control mechanisms. However, appropriate radio resource allocation in such proactive mobile networks has not been fully studied due to lacking channel state information (CSI) and the alleviation of multiple access interference (MAI) in multiple virtual cells. This paper aims to ensure the reliability of downlink communication by a novel radio resource allocation scheme in proactive vehicular networks with ultra-low latency. We regard data transmission success rate as the reliability indicator and propose a joint radio resource allocation model based on the “generalized closed-loop”, where anchor node (AN) uses the radio resource utilization information (RRUI) from the vehicle in the immediate past uplink as a guide to assist resource allocation. Subsequently, we study the radio resource allocation model solution on the vehicle side and the network side respectively. On the vehicle side, vehicles use the local or global data transmission experience to select the radio resource with the best quality as the RRUI. On the network side, according to the latest RRUI of vehicle and resource occupancy information, deep reinforcement learning is proposed to make appropriate radio resource allocation decisions. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the intelligent joint radio resource allocation scheme under the cooperation between vehicles and AN.

However, the limited availability of debugging information on reported bugs complicates the compiler bug isolation task. Existing compiler bug isolation approaches convert the problem into a test program mutation problem, but they are still limited by ineffective mutation strategies or high human effort requirements. Drawing inspiration from the recent progress of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in code generation, we propose a new approach named LLM4CBI to utilize LLMs to generate effective test programs for compiler bug isolation. However, using LLMs directly for test program mutation may not yield the desired results due to the challenges associated with formulating precise prompts and selecting specialized prompts. To overcome the challenges, three new components are designed in LLM4CBI. First, LLM4CBI utilizes a program complexity-guided prompt production component, which leverages data and control flow analysis to identify the most valuable variables and locations in programs for mutation. Second, LLM4CBI employs a memorized prompt selection component, which adopts reinforcement learning to select specialized prompts for mutating test programs continuously. Third, a test program validation component is proposed to select specialized feedback prompts to avoid repeating the same mistakes during the mutation process. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches (DiWi and RecBi) over 120 real bugs from the two most popular compilers, namely GCC and LLVM, our evaluation demonstrates the advantages of LLM4CBI: It can isolate 69.70%/21.74% and 24.44%/8.92% more bugs than DiWi and RecBi within Top-1/Top-5 ranked results. Additionally, we demonstrate that the LLMs component (i.e., GPT-3.5) used in LLM4CBI can be easily replaced by other LLMs while still achieving reasonable results in comparison to related studies.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2024.3397822","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032004,62302077); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M730472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521881","Software debugging;bug isolation;compilers;GCC;LLVM;reinforcement learning;large language models (LLMs)","Computer bugs;Program processors;Task analysis;Codes;Reinforcement learning;Production;Mathematical models","","1","","89","IEEE","7 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional methods like proportional-integral-derivative (PID)controllers and advanced techniques such as evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) have limitations, including computational complexity, sensitivity to parameter changes, and high resource demands. This paper introduces a novel decentralized observer-based backstepping control (DOBC) strategy to overcome these challenges. In our work, each area controller utilizes local measurements and feedback signals to regulate its own area frequency. This approach inherently reduces the reliance on centralized communication and minimizes the impact of potential communication failures, such as packet losses and delays. The proposed method synergistically combines backstepping and disturbance observer techniques, resulting in rapid and stable system responses with reduced control effort, while a noncertainty equivalent adaptive approach ensures exponential disturbance estimation and maintains system stability under time-varying disturbances. Unlike conventional sliding mode control, the proposed method eliminates chattering, making it suitable for sensitive applications. Simulations validate its effectiveness under time delays, parametric uncertainties, nonlinearities, and load disturbances. Results show superior transient response, better oscillation damping, and lower control effort compared to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system based fractional-order PID-acceleration controller (ANFIS-FOPIDA), Second-Order sliding mode control (SOSMC), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper concludes with a rigorous stability and robustness analysis, demonstrating the method’s resilience to parametric uncertainties and time-varying disturbances. This highlights its practical applicability and advantages in modern power systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3554141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10937696","Load frequency control (LFC);disturbance observer based backstepping control strategy (DOBC)","Backstepping;Power system stability;Uncertainty;Disturbance observers;Sensitivity;Artificial intelligence;Robustness;Tuning;Load modeling;Computational complexity","","","","52","CCBY","24 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methodology constructs user-item interaction graphs based on viewing patterns and applies centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness) to identify important videos. Modularity-based clustering groups related content, enabling personalized recommendations. The system was evaluated on a documentary-focused VOD platform with 328 users over four months. Results showed significant improvements: a 63% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 24% increase in view completion rate, and a 17% improvement in user satisfaction. The approach outperformed traditional methods like Naive Bayes and SVM. Future research should explore advanced techniques, such as matrix factorization models, graph neural networks, and hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering. Additionally, incorporating temporal models and addressing scalability challenges for large-scale platforms are essential next steps.

Accurate sales forecasting drives strategic decisions, such as pricing, store allocation, ordering, and inventory management, benefiting all departments within an organization. However, many companies still face challenges due to disconnections between departments and inadequate sharing of information from sales forecasts. This can lead to misalignment between product marketing’s demand plans and sales quotas, resulting in excessive or insufficient inventory and inaccurate sales targets. To address these challenges, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, were adopted. This research focuses on developing an intelligent sales forecasting system using Python and TensorFlow. The system incorporates data preparation, model training, evaluation, and iterative refinement. The ARIMA, SARIMA, and XGBoost models are compared, and the XGBoost model outperforms the others in terms of RMSE (727.13), MSE (528718.04), and MAE (261.29).

This study introduces a comprehensive approach that integrates the Agile Scrum software development life-cycle (SDLC) with a strong emphasis on usability and explainability. In our approach, users were actively involved as co-designers throughout the entire development process. This involvement was crucial for enhancing both the usability and explainability of the product. To assess the practical application of this approach, we applied it to developing a deep learning-based tea fermentation detection model. We engaged users extensively through various methods, including questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, and direct observation, to gather detailed requirements and feedback. The integration of user feedback into the Interactive Design (ID) process aimed to refine and improve the product based on real user experiences. Our findings indicate that this user-centered approach resulted in a 10% increase in project costs and a 25% extension of the timeline. Despite these additional investments, the positive feedback received from users justified the increased expenditure. Notably, our study revealed that female users reported lower levels of satisfaction compared to their male counterparts, a trend consistent with other research. This suggests a need for further exploration into the factors contributing to this disparity and high-lights the importance of addressing gender-specific concerns in software design. Overall, this study underscores the effectiveness of combining agile methodologies with user-centered principles to achieve high usability and explainability. The insights gained emphasize the necessity for continued research into creating more inclusive and effective software solutions. Addressing the diverse needs of all users, including understanding gender-specific differences leads to products that have equitable user experiences and higher satisfaction across various demographics.","2473-5728","979-8-3503-7734-7","10.1109/GHTC62424.2024.10771531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10771531","User-centered Design;Users;Scrum;Agile;Human-Computer Interaction","User centered design;Focusing;Market research;Software;Product development;Usability;Scrum (Software development);Interviews;Software development management;Investment","","","","43","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, numerous obstacles remain to achieving the most out of microservice deployments, especially in terms of a Quality of Service (QoS). One possible approach to overcoming these obstacles is to perform autoscaling, which is the ability of cloud infrastructure and services to scale themselves up or down by changing their resource pool. There are two major categories of autoscaling: reactive and proactive. In reactive autoscaling, a feedback loop based on current workload resource usage is implemented to guide resource scaling. One disadvantage of reactive autoscaling is that it may result in inconsistencies between workload demand and resource allocation. In proactive autoscaling, a prediction model is used to guide the future allocation of resources according to current workload metrics. In this paper, a novel proactive autoscaling method is introduced where a two-state, machine-learning Random Forest (RF) model is designed to forecast the future CPU and memory utilization values required by the microservice workload. These predicted values are then used to adjust the resource pool both vertically (hardware resources) and horizontally (microservice replicas). The RF proactive autoscaler has been implemented on a home-grown, open-source microservice prototyping platform and verified using real-world workloads. The experiments show that the RF proactive autoscaler outperforms state-of-the-art ones in terms of allocated resources and latency. The increase in the utilization of allocated resources can reach 90% and the improvement in end-to-end latency, measured by the  $95^{th}$  percentile, can reach 95%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3234021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005166","Microservices;autoscalers;resource allocation;resource utilization;machine learning;random forest","Microservice architectures;Predictive models;Radio frequency;Resource management;Measurement;Quality of service;Cloud computing;Microservice architectures;Random forests;Machine learning","","21","","35","CCBY","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study presents a novel smart home management methodology that integrates Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with an optimization algorithm to enhance energy efficiency and user comfort. Unlike traditional approaches, which often focus on individual aspects of energy management or user comfort, our method comprehensively addresses both aspects by considering key environmental factors such as air quality, temperature, and illumination. By employing specialized DNNs, our approach dynamically adjusts home conditions to align with user preferences, thereby enhancing overall comfort and satisfaction. The primary innovation of our methodology lies in the Comfort Index Calculation System, which utilizes advanced DNNs to precisely quantify user comfort based on environmental conditions. This system enables our optimization algorithm to iteratively adjust environmental settings, striking a balance between user comfort and energy consumption. By continuously learning from user feedback and environmental data, our integrated approach ensures that smart homes adapt to occupants’ evolving preferences and external conditions, thereby offering a more personalized and responsive living environment. Our results demonstrate the capability of this integrated approach in improving smart home environments, offering significant implications for environmental living and smart building automation. By bridging the gap between energy efficiency and user comfort, our study contributes to advancing the field of smart home management, ultimately realizing the full potential of energy-efficient and comfortable living environments.","2576-3555","979-8-3503-7397-4","10.1109/CoDIT62066.2024.10708437","National Research Foundation; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education; Chungnam National University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10708437","Deep Neural Network;Energy;User Comfort;Optimization;smart Home;Indoor Environment","Energy consumption;Temperature;Heuristic algorithms;Lighting;Smart homes;Artificial neural networks;Air quality;Energy efficiency;Environmental factors;Optimization","","","","24","IEEE","18 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While emotion is often associated with chit-chat and open-domain interactions, it is still a core aspect of human interaction. Though arguably less frequent, a customer’s emotional and social displays are very meaningful in official task-oriented dialogue. Hence why it is crucial for vocal dialogue systems to learn how to properly detect and adapt their behaviour to respond to this social context. This context can be represented by textual and semantic content, but it can also be multimodal, using prosody elements extracted from speech analysis. This research aims to investigate a method to take these social and emotional components for conditional generation, in order to develop a socially competent, task-oriented conversational agent.

In today’s competitive world, Indian Railways manages the second largest railway system by size, which encourages users to communicate to them through tweets on Twitter. This results in a sheer volume of data and makes it impossible for the Railway Administration to answer each user's query or complaint. Sometimes these complaints may include some urgent matters or questions requiring prompt attention.

However, there are still some difficulties such as long data processing time, low accuracy, and unclear correlation among data. To address these issues, we propose a method of early warning of power customer-side demand based on Knowledge Graph (KG) by exploiting the strong reasoning and analysis capabilities of KG. In the relationship extraction of the accepted content of power customer-side demands, we use Transduction Projection Model (TPM) to realize the simultaneous learning of the projection matrix of the hypernym-hyponym relations and the non-hypernym-hyponym relations. The method presents the logical relationships between demand data in figures by establishing the customer-side demand KG, which enables in-depth processing, inference analysis, and early warning management of power customer demand data. Our method can analyze the similarity of customer-side demand and provide early warning of similar demand, which makes an important contribution to further reducing power customer-side demand and improving power customer satisfaction.","","979-8-3503-5914-5","10.1109/ACAIT60137.2023.10528522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528522","Knowledge Graph;Customer-Side Demand;Early Warning system","Analytical models;Correlation;Decision making;Customer satisfaction;Knowledge graphs;Data processing;Real-time systems","","","","17","IEEE","16 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the joint task scheduling and resource allocation under unknown environment dynamics (e.g., transmission latency) remains to be a challenging problem. First, the tradeoff between task latencies and energy consumption should be carefully considered when making decisions to minimize task latencies under time-averaged energy consumption constraints. Second, to learn the environment uncertainties and minimize the system performance loss (i.e., regret) in terms of task latencies, both online feedback and offline history should be leveraged efficiently, and the accompanying exploration-exploitation tradeoff should be dealt with in a proper way. In this article, we formulate the joint task scheduling and resource allocation problem as a constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. To solve the problem, by integrating online learning, online control, and offline historical information, we propose a Task scheduling and Resource allocation scheme with Data-driven Bandit Learning called TRDBL.

We consider a K-armed bandit model where some subset of K arms is partitioned into M groups. Within each group, the random variable associated to each arm follows the same distribution on a finite alphabet. At each time step, the decision maker pulls an arm and observes its outcome from the random variable associated to that arm. Subsequent arm pulls depend on the history of arm pulls and their outcomes. The decision maker has no knowledge of the distributions of the arms or the underlying partitions. The task is to devise an online algorithm to learn the underlying partition of arms with the least number of arm pulls on average and with an error probability not exceeding a pre-determined value  $\delta $ . Several existing problems fall under our general framework, including finding M pairs of arms, odd arm identification, and N-ary clustering of K arms belong to our general framework. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the average number of arm pulls for any online algorithm with an error probability not exceeding  $\delta $ . Furthermore, we develop a computationally-efficient online algorithm based on the Track-and-Stop method and Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and show that the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm asymptotically matches that of the lower bound. Our refined analysis also uncovers a novel bound on the speed at which the average number of arm pulls of our algorithm converges to the fundamental limit as  $\delta $  vanishes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2025.3528655","Singapore National Research Foundation under its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Visiting Professorship Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10838574","Multi-armed bandits;pure exploration;clustering;Frank-Wolfe algorithm;sequential multi-hypothesis testing","Error probability;Testing;Databases;Computer viruses;Clustering algorithms;Resource management;Vectors;Shape;Recommender systems;Random variables","","","","32","IEEE","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With respect to a matrix operator-filter bank that the ma-trix operator-analysis-filter bank H and the matrix operator-sampling-filter bank S are given, firstly, we introduce the detail algorithm to derive the optimum matrix operator-synthesis-filter bank Z that minimizes all the worst-case measures of the matrix operator-error-signals $\mathbf{E}(\omega)=\mathbf{F}(\omega)-\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$ between the matrix operator-input-signals $\mathbf{F}(\omega)$ and the matrix operator-output-signals $\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$ of the matrix operator-filter bank at the same time. Further, feedback is introduced to the above approximation theory and it is indicated that introducing conversations with feedback do not superior automatically to the accumulation of existing knowledge of signal prediction. Secondly, the concept of category in the field of mathematics is applied to the above optimum signal approximation and is indicated that the category-based approximation theory is applied to the set-theoretic con-sideration of the recognition of human. Based on this discussion, it is shown naturally, why the narrow perception that tends to create isolation shows an apparent advantage in the short term and, often, why such narrow thinking becomes intimate with discriminatory action in a human group. Throughout these considerations, it is presented that, in order to abolish easy and intimate discriminatory behavior, it is important create a parallel world of conception where we share the set of invisible error signals including the words and the consciousness of both worlds.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9891929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891929","signal prediction;pseudo inverse matrix;artificial intelligence for gutter between columns and","Deep learning;Measurement uncertainty;Neural networks;Oral communication;Market research;Approximation error;Approximation algorithms","","","","15","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use AHP to determine the weights between these three factors. We then select the products we consider most successful based on the calculated product success index and found that users are most concerned about product quality, price and security.

This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, into code review workflows to enhance software quality and security. By leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs, we aim to streamline the identification of code issues, detect potential security vulnerabilities, and provide developers with actionable feedback. Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature, case studies, and experimental data, this study evaluates the impact of AI-assisted code reviews on developer productivity and code quality. We also address the challenges and limitations of relying on LLMs, including context comprehension and potential biases. Our findings suggest that while LLMs offer significant advantages in automating and improving code reviews, they should complement rather than replace human expertise. This paper provides insights into best practices for integrating LLMs into development workflows, ultimately contributing to more robust and secure software systems.","","979-8-3503-8520-5","10.1109/SPARC61891.2024.10829223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10829223","Large Language Model;Code Review;Software Engineering;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing","Ethics;Technological innovation;Codes;Reviews;Large language models;Collaboration;Software quality;Software systems;Security;Software development management","","","","21","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning is the only available solution to continue teaching during the lockdown periods. The evolution of these studies also needs to adapt to the situation. One of the significant issues with this online evaluation method is the anomalies during the evaluation process. This proposed implementation mainly focuses on anomaly detection of the Moodle environment exam systems. The proposed system produces a Moodle plugin to detect the time taken for each question in the Moodle environment examination system and detect the exam anomalies using the time variations. Then analyze and calculate the time that each candidate has taken for each question and the average time. The invigilator can see the candidates who took more than average time and less than average time and get the suspicious candidate list. The plugin also contains a separate algorithm that monitors the candidate while facing the exam. This face detection algorithm will notice the unusual behaviours of the candidate and upload the created report to the database, and the invigilator can access these reports on their loggings. To guide the candidate system, they also have an AI agent who will help to understand the exam process, give pre-defined answers for the questions, and provide contact details of the relevant authorities for exceptional cases. Also, the developed plugin detects the system information and background apps that run during the exam process and automatically creates relevant reports, and uploads them into the database. After the system implementation, the system was tested using a selected audience. The developed application is an innovative initiative to support the Moodle-based examination process.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905168","artificial intelligence agent;face detection;online examination;Moodle;proctoring","Databases;Education;Prototypes;Bandwidth;Software;Artificial intelligence;Anomaly detection","","2","","10","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automatic plagiarism detection tools using source code similarities are important to combat this issue. For example, Moss and JPlag tools are used worldwide by several universities for the detection of similarity in students' source codes. However, the similarity could cause lead to notification of false positives. Given the large number of students in programming courses, considering only similarity could increase the number of students that the instructors should investigate to decide whether there is plagiarism. In this context, this paper presents the ProjPlag tool that seeks to combine similarity detection results with student behavior data, such as the coding process in the learning management system (LMS) and assignment scores during the programming courses. The ProjPlag automates the utilization of Jplag and Moss tools and also analyses students' behavior by means of data extracted from the Moodle platform, the LMS used in the programming courses at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia. This paper presents an analysis of correlations between the list of confirmed plagiarized assignments with the student behavior data on the Moodle platform, such as time to implement an assignment, the remaining time from the deadline, and the assignment's score. ProjPlag was tested in two different academic semesters at the University of Brasilia in 2022 for the first programming course, (Algorithms and Computer Programming course) in the Department of Computer Science. The findings show that the detection tools can help the instructor to ascertain whether there was plagiarism or not. However, the majority of student behavior data from Moodle had limited relevance in confirming plagiarism and can generate a false alarm. The correlations between confirmed plagiarism and student's behavior (plagiarism and assignments scores, time spent coding, and project scores) on the Moodle platform were low.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342895","programming;plagiarism detection;source code;Moodle","Learning management systems;Correlation;Plagiarism;Source coding;Behavioral sciences;Data mining;Programming profession","","","","25","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dialogue systems are increasingly utilized in various domains, such as customer service, medical consultations, and personal assistants. In these applications, generating natural and consistent responses is a critical challenge. However, existing models often struggle to maintain long-term dialogue coherence or capture hidden meanings and inferential relationships within conversations. To address these limitations, this research presents enhanced modeling techniques based on the Learning to Memorize Entailment and Discourse Relations (LMEDR) framework, effectively capturing contextual consistency and inferential relationships in dialogue. Additionally, a new evaluation metric, Vocabulary-Weighted BLEU (VW-BLEU), is introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional BLEU scores by assessing response diversity and naturalness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance on traditional metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. In addition, our model exhibits higher lexical diversity as reflected by improved Distinct-1 (2.79 vs. 2.47) and Distinct-2 (14.95 vs. 13.82) scores and a significant boost in persona consistency with a Consistency Score of 39.41 compared to 25.31 from the state-of-the-art LMEDR. Furthermore, on the DSTC7-AVSD dataset, our model yields improvements of 13.4% in BLEU and 12.3% in METEOR, confirming its ability to generate responses with enhanced lexical richness and contextual fluency, as further validated by high VW-BLEU scores","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3549152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10916658","Attention mechanism;BART;BLEU;latent variable modeling;national language processing;response generation","Computational modeling;Training;Context modeling;Coherence;Attention mechanisms;Transformers;Measurement;Decoding;Natural language processing;Computer architecture","","","","29","CCBYNCND","6 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moodle is an open source learning management system that allows personalization of its functionality through plugins. In introductory programming courses, it is common to propose problems to students, for which they need to elaborate solution code. The VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) is a popular plugin that allows teachers to create this kind of problem, with automatic evaluation built on top of test-cases. The iAssign (interactive Assignment) is another plugin of the same sort, but with block-based programming. Our plugin is an open-source project, initially developed to integrate with iAssign, and created to integrate easily with any similar plugin used in programming tasks. Our primary goal is to empower teachers and students by supplying a tool that improves the quality of programming in education. Over the last few years, the University of São Paulo has increased its public policy for social inclusion, bringing in even more learners with diverse educational backgrounds. Understanding the students' profiles and being able to modify problems based on these new contexts is fundamental to improve the quality of teaching. This plugin aims to meet the needs of teachers and learners, exploring data from their educational context to improve the learning experience. The plugin automatically extracts data from students' interaction with the coding exercise, e.g. the time between submission (TBS), code changing between submissions (CCBS), and grades. Using these variables, we calculated derived metrics in an attempt to classify exercises according to different parameters. First, we considered time-related metrics, the highest time between submissions (HT). Secondly, we evaluated metrics related to code changes, the highest code changes between submissions (HC). Finally, we accounted for student performance by considering average grades, penalized by time and by number of submissions (AG). A technical contribution of this work is the Moodle plugin that analyzes the students' codes of iAssign, available as free software. The results from this new plugin with eight introductory classes show that it was possible to classify exercises.

The study evaluates four key usability dimensions Learnability, Effectiveness, Information Quality, and Accessibility using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) on data collected from 117 student responses. The analysis identifies that Accessibility, Effectiveness, and Information Quality significantly influence student satisfaction, with Accessibility emerging as the most influential factor. This is attributed to its critical role in ensuring device compatibility and seamless navigation. Interestingly, Learnability did not show a statistically significant impact, suggesting that ease of learning Moodle’s functionalities does not directly contribute to overall satisfaction. The findings underscore the complex nature of LMS usability and the importance of adapting platform features to enhance user experience. Recommendations are provided for improving Moodle’s accessibility and effectiveness, which are key to fostering student engagement and satisfaction.

This research aims to delve into the role of chatbots in increasing customer satisfaction and improving customer services. A systematic literature review was conducted of 10 papers, extracted, and examined to identify the impact of chatbots on customer satisfaction and services. Based on the review, the study discovered that the use of chatbots has increased over the COVID-19 period (2020-2022) due to the need for social media, which positively impacts customer satisfaction by offering improved high-quality services. The present literature review has found a significant research gap regarding the impact of chatbots on customer satisfaction. Specifically, although many studies are available on chatbots, only a few studies have been conducted to focus on a specific sector. Furthermore, there is a need for more research because there is a lack of information regarding the impact of chatbot emotional expressions on customer satisfaction. Therefore, to gain a deeper understanding of this emerging subject and the impact of chatbots on customer satisfaction, future research must concentrate on analyzing these elements in greater detail.","","979-8-3503-7222-9","10.1109/ICETSIS61505.2024.10459497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10459497","chatbots;customer satisfaction;customer service quality;customer experience;customer loyalty","COVID-19;Systematics;Reviews;Social networking (online);Customer services;Bibliographies;Customer satisfaction","","","","18","IEEE","19 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that purpose, two optimization techniques followed by fine-tuning are proposed and simulated to get the optimized PID parameters. The first proposed optimization method applies the Satin Bowerbird (SB) optimization technique to optimize the PID parameters. The Crow Search Optimization (CSO) technique is applied to the SB results to improve the algorithm's performance and the PID parameters. The second proposed method applies the Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO) technique for the optimization of the PID parameters. The results of both methods are fine-tuned. Moreover, a Kalman filter is used to improve the outcomes after and before tuning the PID parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed first method is more effective for the optimization methods of the PID controller, and its results outperform the results given by previously published research.","","979-8-3503-0030-7","10.1109/LT58159.2023.10092348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092348","Hybrid Robot;Metaheuristic techniques;Crow Search Optimization (CSO);Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO);Satin Bowerbird optimization (SBO);and PID controller","PI control;Simulation;Search methods;Robot control;Metaheuristics;Optimization methods;Kalman filters","","2","","19","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it remains unclear what types of action-outcome mappings can enable users to easily learn, control, and feel a sense of ownership of these augmented superpowers. Humans develop a set of sensorimotor regularities (i.e., image schemas and lawful relations between them) from recurring bodily experiences since early infancy, and use them to predict the outcome of our actions, or choose actions based on the desired outcome. We investigate whether sensorimotor regularities (SRs) can serve as effective design constraints for superpower interactions, by comparing three temporal manipulation methods in MR games: (1) mid-air button control; (2) gestures incongruent with SRs embedded in the concept of temporal manipulation; and (3) gestures congruent with these SRs. A within-subject study with 18 participants reveals that the SRs-congruent method enables significantly improved task performance, lower overall workload, and a greater sense of agency and presence compared to both an SRs-incongruent method and a mid-air button-based method. The SRs-congruent method also enabled faster mastery of the augmented superpower. No significant difference was observed in any of the above-mentioned metrics between the SRs-incongruent and mid-air button-based methods. These results empirically demonstrate multiple benefits of SRs as design constraints for superpower controls in MR, and encourage future research to explore their wider applicability in superpower interaction design.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2025.3549876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10919211","Human augmentation;Mixed Reality;Image Schemas;Sensorimotor Contingencies","Virtual reality;Mixed reality;Motors;Games;Pressing;Hands;Contingency management;Training;Thumb;Headphones","","","","","IEEE","10 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Therefore, by using UBUMonitor, teachers will be able to easily visualize their students’ engagement with their subject, which can facilitate early action to prevent students from dropping out more effectively.","1932-8540","","10.1109/RITA.2022.3191279","Consejería de Educación de la Junta de Castilla y León through the University of Burgos(grant numbers:OL-2018-01); European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830714","Dropout;logs;monitoring;moodle;teaching-learning;visual analytics","Statistics;Sociology;Video on demand;Education;Pandemics;Internet;Head","","4","","30","IEEE","15 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study is performed on data acquired from four classes within the same subject, for whom we make inferences about student performance marks. The developed methodology describes the degree in which the acquired information allows to predict the student marks belonging to the continuous evaluation, while the prediction of the final students marks has a higher intrinsic complexity that would require a more in- depth study of the relevant variables. Then, we follow a fully data-driven process to discover similarities among classes. In particular, we propose the use of a dependence estimation measure, the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence criterion. We show how this dependence measure is useful to determine relations among classes, based on their particular teaching methodology, by only using data acquired from the LMS. This opens the door to explore the capabilities of LMS in similarity search between offered courses along an educational platform.

For students to achieve the intended learning outcomes, a theoretically founded and innovative LD is essential. The next step is the orchestration of course delivery according to the prepared LD; however, due to real-life circumstances, delivery can deviate from the plan. Therefore, it is important to compare LD and delivery, identify potential differences, justify them, or redesign the course. In this comparison process, it is necessary to evaluate constructive alignment and assessment validity. These processes are described in the paper, along with their automation using the Balanced Design Planning (BDP) concept and tool for LD. The most significant achievement in this direction is the automatic scaffolding of a course in the open LMS Moodle directly from the BDP LD tool.

For some students, online quizzes successfully developed their motivation and kept it throughout the course. We understand that they are motivated intrinsically. However, for some other students, online quizzes led to less motivation, because they felt the quizzes were too difficult. Additionally, we found that some students kept their motivation to some extent, and resulted in low scores. We understand that they are motivated only externally.

However, there are errors in the QA system, which can cause inconvenience for users and even lead to economic losses and security issues. In response to these challenges, QAQA showed up. QAQA designs several metamorphic relations (MRs) and achieves precise automatic testing through semantic-guided search and enhanced test oracles. However, QAQA fairly selects each seed (initial test input) in sequential order and assigns them a fixed number of mutations, which leaves many seeds that could produce quality test inputs neglected. This paper proposes an improved version named QAQA-SS (QAQA-Seed Schedule), where we enhance QAQA with a seed scheduling module and a fuzzing framework featuring iterative feedback. We combine the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm with perplexity to devise a novel seed scheduling algorithm. QAQA-SS selects superior seeds and allocates appropriate mutation counts (energy) to generate more error-inducing test inputs within a limited energy budget. Additionally, we introduce a text paraphrasing operation to improve the performance of finding errors in the QA system. We conducted experiments following the experimental setup of QAQA on three datasets: BoolQ, SQuAD2, and NarrativeQA. Our experimental results reveal a noteworthy enhancement in the error discovery rate for QAQA-SS, achieving 81,777 error discoveries compared to 64,354 error discoveries with QAQA.","2693-9371","979-8-3503-6565-8","10.1109/QRS-C63300.2024.00089","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172194,62202206,U1836116); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005500); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20220515); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M691310); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10727010","Fuzzing;Question Answering System;Perplexity;Upper Confidence Bound;Paraphrasing","Schedules;Scheduling algorithms;Natural languages;Software quality;Fuzzing;Scheduling;Question answering (information retrieval);Software reliability;Security;Resource management","","","","38","IEEE","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Knowledge embedding is introduced into the graph convolution network for effective topology inference; 2) Cross-Period Clothing Change Network: This network aggregates spatio-temporal information for clothing generation. By utilizing overall pedestrian clothing characteristics whthin logical topology cameras, it mitigates matching errors caused by external factors; and 3) Joint Optimization Mechanism: A collaborative approach involving both the topology inference network and cross-period clothing change network. Multi-camera logical topology offers auxiliary information and retrieval order for the clothing change network, while pedestrian re-identification results provide feedback to adjust the logical topology.

One example is examining typical perceptions of a product based on customer feedbacks to have a better understanding of consumer expectations, which can help enhance everything from customer service to product offerings. Online review comments, on the other hand, frequently mix different languages, use non-native scripts and do not adhere to strict grammar norms. For a low-resource language like Bangla, the lack of annotated code-mixed data makes automated sentiment analysis more challenging. To address this, we collect online reviews of different products and construct an annotated Bangla-English code mix (BE-CM) dataset (Dataset and other resources are available at https://github.com/fokhruli/CM-seti-anlysis). On our sentiment corpus, we also compare several alternative models from the existing literature. We present a simple but effective data augmentation method that can be utilized with existing word embedding algorithms without the need for a parallel corpus to improve cross-lingual contextual understanding. Our experimental results suggest that training word embedding models (e.g., Word2vec, FastText) with our data augmentation strategy can help the model in capturing the cross-lingual relationship for code-mixed sentences, thereby improving the overall performance of existing classifiers in both supervised learning and zero-shot cross-lingual adaptability. With extensive experimentations, we found that XGBoost with Fasttext embedding trained on our proposed data augmentation method outperforms other alternative models in automated sentiment analysis on code-mixed Bangla-English dataset, with a weighted F1 score of 87%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277787","Centre for Advanced Research in Strategic Human Resource Management (CARSHRM), University of Dhaka; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129187","Code mixed;sentiment analysis;Bangla-English corpus;bi-lingual;zero-shot learning","Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Semantics;Codes;Analytical models;Tagging;Data models;Data augmentation","","10","","79","CCBYNCND","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a pivot to these radio technologies is the effective management of large-scale antenna arrays, which aims to construct valid spatial streams to maximize system throughput. In this paper, the authors explored generative artificial intelligence to accurately model the environment particularly for radio simulations and identify valid paths within it for real-time spatial-channel state information (CSI) prediction. Different from the traditional management methods that predominantly rely on user feedback to adapt to dynamic wireless channels, the proposed approach lies in the prediction of spatial-CSI which is a channel characterization that consists of all robust line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths between the transmitter and receiver, with three-di-mensional (3D) trajectory, attenuation, phase shift, delay, and polarization of each path. The authors argued that by exploiting the multi-path effect, it can enhance the spatial capabilities of wire-less channels using antenna arrays and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations for 6G wireless communication technologies.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2024.10702538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10702538","","","","","","0","IEEE","1 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, current systems, such as Rasa, Moodle Integrated Chatbots, and ChatterBot, present significant limitations in precision, adaptability, and response time, affecting their effectiveness in resolving academic queries and personalizing learning. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes the development of an advanced educational chatbot that combines large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs, allowing for more accurate and contextualized responses and offering valuable suggestions to enrich the learning process. The system is evaluated based on its ability to adjust to different student profiles and offer fast and accurate responses.

Through comprehensive data analysis, we identified existing issues in the current SRS, primarily related to the feedback mechanism for students' answers, limited question types, nonintuitive feedback reports, and a lack of flexibility in impromptu question creation. In order to address these challenges, we have developed SwiftQuiz, which offers instructors the ability to create instantaneous questions, thereby improving teaching efficiency and eliminating unnecessary complexities. Furthermore, SwiftQuiz enables the creation of short-answer questions with two visual response options: Word Cloud and bar graph. Moreover, for multiple-choice question and other question types, SwiftQuiz provides a detailed data visualization of student answers, empowering educators with valuable insights into live classroom management and student engagement. By incorporating SwiftQuiz into blended classes, educators can significantly enhance classroom flexibility and engage students more interactively in the learning process.

Data-driven event and alarm management have the potential to reduce human operator cognitive burden. However, the high complexity of events, the data semantics, and the large variety of equipment and technologies are key barriers for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to raw SCADA data. In this context, this paper proposes a methodology to convert a large volume of alarm events into data mining terminology, creating the conditions for the application of modern AI techniques to alarm data. Moreover, this work also proposes two novel data-driven applications based on SCADA data: (i) identification of anomalous behaviors regarding the performance of the protection relays of primary substations, during circuit breaker tripping alarms in High Voltage (HV) and Medium Voltage (MV) lines; (ii) unsupervised learning to cluster similar events in HV line panels, classify new event logs based on the obtained clusters and membership grade with a control parameter that helps to identify rare events. Important aspects associated with data handling and pre-processing are also covered. The results for real data from a Distribution System Operator (DSO) showed: (i) that the proposed method can detect unexpected relay pickup events, e.g., one substation with nearly 41% of the circuit breaker alarms had an ‘atypical’ event in their context (revealed an overlooked problem on the electrification of a protection relay); (ii) capability to automatically detect and group issues into specific clusters, e.g., SF6 low-pressure alarms and blocks with abnormal profiles caused by event time-delay problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190398","National Funds National Funds through the Portuguese Funding Agency, FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:LA/P/0063/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826735","SCADA;power system protection;data-driven;digital substation;alarm message;contextual knowledge","Relays;Semantics;Synthetic aperture sonar;Natural language processing;Circuit breakers;Terminology;Standards","","6","","37","CCBY","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AEML can effectively integrate GPUs into distributed processing framework and achieve great load-balance among multiple heterogeneous GPUs. We propose a heterogeneous task execution model based on multiple GPUs and multiple streams (MGMS), which can effectively balance the workload of multiple GPUs. MGMS model utilizes four core techniques: a fine-grained task mapping mechanism, a device resource unified management scheme, a novel resource-aware GPU task scheduling strategy, and a feedback-based streams adjustment scheme. The implementation of AEML system is based on Spark 3.0.0 and NVIDIA CUDA 10.0. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of AEML with multiple typical benchmarks.

The most popular testing theories are Classical test theory and Item response theory. In this paper, we will focus on metrics used in the Item response theory, which deals with evaluating the performance of the test from the point of view of individual questions, through metrics such as the Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Random score estimate, and others. In the 2023/2024 academic term, 239 second-year students in the field of computer science participated in the Operating Systems course. After passing each test, we proceeded to evaluate the test performance based on the statistics available in the MoodIe system. We evaluated a total of 41 testing items, primarily focused on Discrimination index, Item difficulty, Intended weight and Efficiency weight. We identified 5 testing items, which do not perform well enough. In order to be able to evaluate the overall test performance, we decided to calculate the reliability of the test using the Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR20) metric. KR20 metric is used to measure the internal consistency reliability of a test. We calculated the KR20 value before adjusting all three tests, and also after adjusting the tests. In all three cases there was an improvement in the value of KR20 in the interval from 3.63% to 5.37%, which indicates higher internal consistency of all three tests. Conclusion: We evaluated test performance of 3 tests based on the MoodIe statistics. We identified five testing items that were shown not to work based on manual verification as well as on the MoodIe test statistics. We eliminated those testing items and observed an improvement in the test reliability calculated by KR20 metric, resulting in an improvement in test performance.","","979-8-3315-2771-6","10.1109/ICETA63795.2024.10850813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10850813","Moodie statistics;Item response theory;test performance evaluation","Measurement;Performance evaluation;Computer science;Electronic learning;Operating systems;Manuals;Reliability theory;Indexes;Testing","","","","9","IEEE","28 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within LMS, online exams have emerged as a critical tool for assessing students’ performance and understanding of course material, playing a vital role in determining their progression. Ensuring the reliability and transparency of online exam results is imperative. Any vulnerability, such as hacking, can adversely impact students’ grades. Conventional online exam systems often store data centrally in databases like MySQL, making them susceptible to unauthorized access and manipulation. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework to enable secure and peer-to-peer conduction and evaluation of academic exams. The framework uses hashing techniques to ensure data integrity and employs proof of stake mechanisms for enhanced security. Blockchain’s decentralized data storage and cryptographic hashing for each block make it effective in safeguarding data integrity. The paper demonstrates the use of blockchain for developing online exams, storing each question and answer directly on the blockchain. To achieve this, we have created a module that integrates with the Moodle learning management system. Through a comparative analysis with Moodle’s default centralized storage, our module modifies the exam result storage, ensuring secure and tamper-proof data storage on the blockchain. By leveraging the blockchain, exam data is reliably secured, maintaining integrity, and resisting manipulation. Our results show that data stored on the blockchain is entirely accurate, with no discrepancies compared to Moodle’s standard approach. The blockchain network provides a reliable and immutable platform, preventing unauthorized changes to student data. In conclusion, our blockchain-based framework offers a robust solution for enhancing the security and reliability of online exam results. By harnessing blockchain’s decentralized and tamper-proof nature, we ensure data integrity and transparency, providing a more trustworthy assessment of academic performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3304995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216975","Blockchain;online test;online examination systems;smart contracts;Ethereum;meta mask wallet;learning management systems;LMS;Moodle;centralized ledger database;CLD","Blockchains;Reliability;Smart contracts;Cryptocurrency;Learning management systems;Education;Electronic learning;Online services;Online banking","","9","","20","CCBY","14 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this study proposes a novel single-stage model based on YOLOv8s, designed for two primary purposes: detecting workers' personal protective equipment and monitoring and recognizing when workers enter hazardous ar-eas.

However, this paper aims to take a proactive approach by developing a framework that can monitor student learning and predict their performance well before they fall into the SAR category. To develop this framework, the authors conducted a case study among the undergraduate students offered in a HEI at Oman.

The main goal is to understand the students’ task-related behavior, to generate a comprehensible model, and to comprehend how it is related to their academic performance. The students were grouped using a single feature calculated for each task the students must complete in the course. The results show that this single feature is enough to model the students’ behavior and their academic performance. Different clustering algorithms and number of clusters were used, and K-Means algorithm with three clusters achieved the best result. These three groups are comprehensible and explain the students’ behavior according to their activity in the task’s submission. The clusters also have a direct relation to the students’ final grade in the course, being one of them composed of students at risk of failure.","","978-1-6654-7087-2","10.1109/ICECET55527.2022.9872960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9872960","Educational Data Mining;Learning Analytics;Clustering;Learning Management System;Moodle;Student Performance","COVID-19;Correlation;Pandemics;Clustering algorithms;Behavioral sciences;Data mining;Task analysis","","1","","18","IEEE","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several studies show that the retention rates for such courses are high among the students in the introductory classes all across the globe. With the ever-increasing demand from the industry for professionals with programming skills, higher education institutions pressure the teachers for more positive results.The same demand for more efficiency and effectiveness is common in every sector of the industry, including software. DevOps is a software development methodology largely adopted by the software industry, that promotes the continuous improvement of the software development process. This methodology simplifies the problems across all development stages and promotes cooperation supported by the automation of tasks through tools and well-defined flows.This paper presents a method that explores the possibility to improve the process of teaching-learning computer programming, by recurring to the principles of DevOps to create an improved approach able to individualize learning and reduce the teacher’s effort. A Moodle-based platform was developed with several mechanisms that 1) automate tasks such as providing learning materials and exercises to each student, controlling the performance of the work, and providing feedback to student and teacher; 2) allow teachers to receive quick feedback and focus on what really matters, i.e., the difficulties of the students, the preparation of new learning resources for each student or group of students; and 3) let the students practice and study at their own pace. A pilot experience took place with one teacher and the students of an introductory course of Programming. Although preliminary and with the participation of a reduced number of students, the obtained results are promising.","2472-7687","978-1-6654-8442-8","10.1109/EAEEIE54893.2022.9820399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820399","Teaching-learning computer programming;DevOps;Moodle;Teaching efficiency;Code Runner","Industries;Visualization;Automation;Education;Europe;Software;Encoding","","","","11","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conversely, forced lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic may have increased children exposure to Internet threats due to the unsupervised usage of social networks. As a result, despite being more tech-savvy than adults, children are still naive, making them an easy target for attackers, urging families and schools to learn about Internet threats and effective ways to counter them. In this paper, we expand previous work, by delivering a virtual learning environment powered by Moodle to teach cybersecurity to Spanish-speaking children through interactive content.

However, there are Dynamic Spectrum Access technologies in the unused VHF and UHF analog TV band called TV White Space that can be used to provide high-speed Wi-Fi access over wide coverage and at lower cost. Since March 2020, courses have been suspended at the University of Bangui to effectively limit and combat the COVID-19 pandemic. After a three-month period of containment, academic activities have resumed. The increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 contamination raises concerns about this resumption. Given the rules of social distancing that limit the number of students in classrooms, the risks of travelling by public transport and the lack of motivation of some students following years of war, the University of Bangui can organize distance learning as a transitional measure.This paper is the subject of a feasibility study on the interconnection of surrounding neighborhoods and villages by TV White Space at the University of Bangui that can accommodate students and teachers for distance learning courses in the context of COVID-19.The methodological approach consists in studying the deployment of a White Space TV network to interconnect the peripheral areas at the University of Bangui, then using the Moodle distance learning platform on which we integrate the virtual classroom plugin, deployed locally and running without Internet connectivity. The bandwidth of the White Space TV will be important to practice the educational activities without spending money to pay the Internet credits of the operators’ networks. Students can connect locally via Wi-Fi in the areas covered by the platform and follow the different academic activities according to their geographical location, while others closer to the university can go to the classroom to attend classes with the professor in the rules enacted for protection against COVID-19.Our solution initially helps to break the digital divide and then to promote e-learning at the University of Bangui in the context of COVID-19.","1738-9445","979-11-88428-08-3","10.23919/ICACT53585.2022.9728876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9728876","COVID-19;interconnection;TVWS;e-learning;Moodle;virtual classroom","COVID-19;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Pandemics;Human factors;Bandwidth;White spaces","","","","26","","11 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It not only helps reinforce learned concepts immediately, but also encourages the exploration of new concepts and language constructs. Integrating hands-on activities into traditional programming classrooms, however, presents a fundamental challenge. Coordinating instructor explanations with student coding activities and providing timely feedback to all students before moving forward is impractical for large or medium-sized classes. This paper demonstrates how cognitive and constructive learning principles can help transform a classroom into an active learning environment that blends conceptual learning and hands-on experience for an object-oriented programming course. Instead of attending traditional lectures, our students use the class time to participate in Moodle-based activities that feature diverse question types and immediate feedback. They work at their own pace, individually or in small teams, while the instructor guides them and provides support as needed. In a section of 41 students, 88% preferred this approach over lectures.

Even though these platforms are already well-known and have been widely used for a long time, transitioning to fully online activities with a large number of users can lead to an exponential growth in resource usage. Moreover, the availability of these platforms becomes critical since the learning activities cannot be interrupted, and the vital information (assignments, grades, and shared resources) cannot be lost. Thus, the system administrators must implement a scalable solution to accommodate many users and activities. Determining the most suitable architecture is a non-trivial task that must consider the various tools, services, and interconnect options that are available. This paper presents our approach to setting up an integrated high-workload e-learning setup used for online classes in University Politehnica of Bucharest and can be used as a reference by other universities. The e-learning platform must accommodate around 35000 users and 11000 courses; thus, its management is not trivial. In this paper we present our approach to integrating all the services necessary for a responsive online platform and to automating e-learning management operations such as class creation and user course enrolments.

Several assessment methods have required testing questions such as selection or filler. However, it is still challenging to identify the root cause of these errors by assessing these questions.Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language used for relational database management and data manipulation; though particularly useful for querying, adding, modifying, and deleting records in databases, it is a fundamental skill and an essential course for students in the information field to learn how to use databases. Therefore, this study proposes using an annotation tool for peer assessment of SQL language learning and analyzing the correlation between this method and learning outcomes to verify that the method helps assess students' SQL language writing and error detection abilities. The results of the study showed that the average score of students who used the annotation tool to learn SQL language was 17.38 points higher than that of students who did not use the annotation tool, thus proving that the annotation tool can improve learning outcomes.","2325-5994","979-8-3503-2469-3","10.1109/iCAST57874.2023.10359259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10359259","Structure Query Language;annotation tool;Moodle;learning outcomes","Structured Query Language;Correlation;Annotations;Relational databases;Programming;Writing;Internet of Things","","","","23","IEEE","21 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, existing research often confines its focus to individual courses, overlooking potential patterns that may transcend course boundaries. Our research addresses these challenges by implementing an automated dataflow that directly queries data from the Moodle database via SQL, offering the flexibility of filtering on individual courses if needed. In addition to analyzing individual Moodle activities, we explore patterns at an aggregated course section level. Furthermore, we present a method for standardizing section labels across courses, facilitating cross-course analysis to uncover broader usage patterns. Our findings reveal, among other insights, that higherperforming students demonstrate a propensity to engage more frequently with available activities and exhibit more dynamic movement between objects. While these patterns are discernible when analyzing individual course activity-events, they become more pronounced when aggregated to the section level and analyzed across multiple courses.","2378-1971","979-8-3315-2909-3","10.1109/CBI62504.2024.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10801289","business process management;learning analytics;process mining;process analytics;business process intelligence","Process mining;Correlation;Navigation;Filtering;Event detection;Databases;Informatics;Business","","","","11","IEEE","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Single Sign On is a log-in authentication system allowing users to access multiple resources with only one authentication, while Moodle is a popular platform for online learning media. By supplying a JSON Web Token (JWT), the server can provide the client permission to access protected data stored on the server via the OAuth2 protocol. The test method are SSO testing between academic systems and e-learning Moodle, token validation, JWT structure verification, and Network Sniffing Attack.

With the advent and increasing usage of self-hosted online learning platforms like Moodle, universities need innovative ways to engage students to make learning tasks interesting, personally relevant and, hence, motivating. Gamification or ""use of game elements"" in education is one such innovation that has been found to support motivation and completion of tasks in a timely manner. However, research reveals the increasing need to differentiate game experiences by personalizing game designs for different player typologies or ""user types"" based on different motivational orientations. This study is based on experiences of students in an IT course in education, where the learning platform in Moodle was modified by implementing certain game elements such as narratives, avatar development and thematic badges. Data were collected through online questionnaires filled by student teachers, which aimed at identifying their predominant gamification user-types using an instrument based on the Hexad Player Type framework for gamification design. Based on the information gathered from these questionnaires, the course material was designed to better fit the characteristics of the major user types, and relevant recommendations were provided to the students for approaching the course material. The results show the predominant gamification user types in this group of students to be Philanthropist (motivated by purpose) and Socializer (motivated by relatedness). Similarities and differences of the predominant user types in this group are discussed in relation to different participant groups from similar studies carried out in different contexts. The study calls for further investigation of purpose and relatability as motivation factors when designing IT-related courses for students in education. Collectively, these results could be used to inform the design of online and blended learning platforms to improve the interest, engagement and motivation of learners.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962592","gamification;user-types higher education;teacher education;blended learning","Technological innovation;Instruments;Avatars;Education;Games;Hybrid learning;Task analysis","","3","","27","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine(PCM) has introduced the online Google Classroom (GC) to the fifth-year medical students, in the academic year of 2019. The main purpose of the online GC may be applied to the flipped classroom for the fifth-year medical students. Due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic situation at the time of this academic year, each rotation should get a different learning method. Therefore, it appeared that the second to the seventh rotation from total 8 rotations learned by blended education. Face to face manner of teaching was applied first then it was switched to online GC. After that, the eighth rotation came at the same time of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, they were switched to the online GC only. It may be very hard if the online teaching has not been prepared before the time comes. The purpose of this study was to report the result of the application of GC and difference between group of the second to seventh rotation and the group of eighth rotations. How, the first rotation was not included in the study since they had opportunity to learn only face to face procedure. Methods: This is a descriptive prospective study by data collection from 86 medical students of the second to eighth rotations while the eighth rotation studied 100% online. The variable data, including a general information, satisfaction, and tools for accessing the GC were obtained from the questionnaires given to the second to the eighth rotation of the fifth-year medical students. Besides, the daily quiz (DQ) created and evaluated by the second-year residents were preformed and analyzed for the relationship with multiple choice question marks, slide quiz marks, objective structured clinical examination marks and practical marks. Moreover, the questionnaires regarding the comparison between the Google Classroom and the Moodle (MD) were also given to the sixth to eight rotations. Results: From evaluation (of the full mark of 5) of satisfaction and usage, it was found that the satisfaction was 4.7, difficulty to access was 3.2, suitability of DQ was 4.5 as well as the content of pedagogy, bedside teaching and OPD teaching conform with DQ was 4.5. Information through GC was useful by 4.2. Convenience to do SDL through GC was 4.5. Preferring to do SDL through GC was 4.5 and believe that GC could reduce paper consumption was 4.8. Comparison between GC and MD, there were 66.7% (26/39) of students who answered the evaluation with 96.1% preferred GC. Among these, 80.8% thought GC was easier to access, and 76.9% thought GC was more user friendly than MD. Correlation analysis by Pearson correlation, it was found that rotation was related to slide quiz (p = 0.010) and PBL marks (p < 0.001). Those who had more numbers of answering quizzes would gain higher quiz marks (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Using of the blended education to familiarize students, faculty and support staffs with learning management system are important since if 100% online teaching is needed. The change from face to face to online could be easily performed. Almost of student preferred Google Classroom to Moodle.","","978-1-6654-9555-4","10.1109/DGTi-CON53875.2022.9849191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9849191","Blended education;Google Classroom;SARS-COV-2;Online Teaching","Learning management systems;Electronic learning;Pandemics;Distance learning;Education;Switches;Internet","","","","10","Crown","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Twenty topics have been defined on which students could work in groups of 3-5 people and create a tutorial that would be made available to the rest of their peers. We have developed a Python script that processes a set of metrics such as concurrent connections, relationship between connections and students as well as between members of the groups and periods of connections. From this kind of interactions, we have related the degree of participation of each student, how each group has been involved, when the students of the same group have met in Moodle at the same time, and the grades obtained. In the PBL, 56 students have participated and at the end of the process we have obtained feedback from 38 students through a Likert-type survey. The results of the virtual monitoring show that peer-to-peer learning and continuous interaction among the members of the PBL groups reduce the isolation of the students in virtual environments and favor the successful completion of the course.","","978-1-6654-7464-1","10.1109/SIIE56031.2022.9982317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982317","e-learning;peer-to-peer learning;project-based learning (PBL);learning management systems;learning analytics","Measurement;Electronic learning;Federated learning;Education;Virtual environments;Collaboration;Tutorials","","","","13","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And the time gained in person can be used in tasks that are much more productive than traditional lectures. This study is based on an introductory programming semester of post lockdown COVID-19, initially with 101 students, with the strategy of providing study materials for students to work on before class (as in flipped classes). We use attendance in classes, access-work MOODLE, the two grades obtained during the semester, as well as some information about the student (age, course, gender, previous knowledge of programming languages), and the level that the students think it was their presence in classes and on MOODLE in the middle and at the end of the semester to measure the success of the experiment.

"AttenFace: A Real Time Attendance System Using Face Recognition","A. Rao","International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",2022 IEEE 6th Conference on Information and Communication Technology (CICT),"4 Jan 2023","2022","","","1","5","The current approach to marking attendance in colleges is tedious and time consuming. I propose AttenFace, a standalone system to analyze, track and grant attendance in real time using face recognition. Using snapshots of class from live camera feed, the system identifies students and marks them as present in a class based on their presence in multiple snapshots taken throughout the class duration. Face recognition for each class is performed independently and in parallel, ensuring that the system scales with number of concurrent classes. Further, the separation of the face recognition server from the back-end server for attendance calculation allows the face recognition module to be integrated with existing attendance tracking software like Moodle. The face recognition algorithm runs at 10 minute intervals on classroom snapshots, significantly reducing computation compared to direct processing of live camera feed. This method also provides students the flexibility to leave class for a short duration (such as for a phone call) without losing attendance for that class. Attendance is granted to a student if he remains in class for a number of snapshots above a certain threshold. The system is fully automatic and requires no professor intervention or any form of manual attendance or even camera set-up, since the back-end directly interfaces with in-class cameras. AttenFace is a first-of-its-kind one-stop solution for face-recognition-enabled attendance in educational institutions that prevents proxy, handling all aspects from students checking attendance to professors deciding their own attendance policy, to college administration enforcing default attendance rules.","","978-1-6654-7312-5","10.1109/CICT56698.2022.9998001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998001","real-time attendance;face recognition;software architecture;deep learning","Face recognition;Software algorithms;Manuals;Cameras;Real-time systems;Software;Information and communication technology","","12","","14","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At various stages in the learning process, emotions can have an impact on the learner. Positive emotions could act as a catalyst during learning while negative emotions could act as a resistor. As educators, it is crucial to consider learners’ emotions during their learning process. Educators need to design their teaching methods/ practices adapting to learner emotions. For this, emotions need to be assessed. Assessment can be done during physical classes where educators assess through their tacit knowledge. However, it is quite impossible for educators during online classes. This research focuses on assessing learner emotions during online learning by analyzing learner behavioral patterns using behavior theories. Data for the analysis is obtained from event data in Moodle Learning Management System. Finally, I expect to develop a software solution beneficial for educators to design their teaching methods/ practices considering their learners’ emotions.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962490","Online classroom;emotional learning;behavior theory;learner emotion assessment","Resistors;Learning management systems;Analytical models;Design methodology;Catalysts;Education;Software","","5","","12","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study showcased in this paper analyzes the direct influence between the activity volume of students in a course, as given by Moodle LMS logs, and academic performance, in the form of the final grade obtained. Moreover, we perform separate observations of this influence depending on whether the student is enrolled in the course for the first time, or if they are retaking it after failing to pass in previous academic years. The results show that a correlation exists between raw volume of interactions with the LMS and final grade, but only for first-time students.

There may have been some uncertainty on how to perform e-learning properly because many educational institutions may not have expected the rapid change in learning style. This is especially true when it comes to offering an e-learning management system (LMS). This study aims to examine the affordances of higher education institutions in Indonesia in conducting the e-learning during the pandemic. To understand more about the adoption of e-learning in their individual institutions, we conducted an online survey towards 100 university lecturers from several cities. The results revealed that 79% of the participants used a specially built LMS in their universities, while the rest still used commercially built LMS like Moodle. Then, 82% of the participants prefer blended learning model which combined face-to-face and e-learning models, and 46% of them wanted to have a fifty-fifty division between face to face and e-learning. As for the challenges, no interaction with students was deemed as the most disturbing challenge for the lecturers. The results imply that e-learning will continue to be implemented in Indonesia, regardless of the condition of the pandemic. Thus, universities should provide an e-LMS that can cater all the e-learning needs, while lecturers should also equip themselves with pedagogical as well as technological skills to face the e-learning challenges.","","978-1-6654-6548-9","10.1109/ICIET56899.2023.10111265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10111265","e-learning;learning management system;teaching technology;higher education","COVID-19;Electronic learning;Uncertainty;Pandemics;Affordances;Education;Urban areas","","2","","15","IEEE","2 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of covid-19, one of the barrier gestures being social distancing, face-to-face classes have been suspended. Many higher education institutions that were not prepared for e-learning suddenly switched to online courses in order not to lose the academic year. Students no longer have the follow-up that they had when they were learning face-to-face. The chatbot proposed in this work could help reduce the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the students' level.

When creating exams or exercises for students in such a setting, teachers often face the following issues: (1) having to create exercises for multiple platforms, (2) lack of support for creating complex exercises, and (3) having to transfer exercises between platforms. To solve these issues we created a platformin-dependent tool for creating e-learning exercises and exams. The system relies on the structured Markdown format, which is then parsed and exported to learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, or to PDF. Scripts can be used to fully customize and randomize the Markdown exercises for each student, which mitigates cheating through copying answers, and enables holding exams that students take asynchronously. Overall, we argue that as digital learning ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex, educational institutions and teachers should strive more strongly for platform independence.

Over the past few years, deepfake detection has been the subject of extensive research, most which centered on the application of machine learning strategies. However, the recognition of deepfake is still one of the most challenging problems in computer vision today. Deep learning has recently gained popularity due to its potential to solve a wide range of real-world problems, including detecting deepfakes. Our research focused on improving feature extraction methods by using deep learning and comparing preprocessing methods to show how they affect detection performance. A preprocessing approach was proposed to improve the regions of interest (ROIs) used to feed Moodle feature extraction. The proposed algorithmic approach involves finding one key frame extracted from a video by using the oriented fast and rotated brief algorithm, detecting the face oval region using the DLIB library as an ROI and performing quality improvement via contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)/adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and comparing them. On the FaceForensics ++ dataset, CLAHE demonstrated superior performance compared with AHE with InceptionV3 as a feature extractor.

Armed groups occupy 80% of the territory. They often use school buildings as base camps, playgrounds as shooting ranges and transform desks and chairs into firewood. Due to insecurity, most of the qualified teachers have abandoned their posts to stay in Bangui, the capital of the country. School-age children are left to their own devices without education. This constitutes a danger to peace, security and the socio-economic development of the country. Going to school, learning to read and write is a right that all children should enjoy.In this article, we propose a digital elementary school solution in conflict areas with moodlebox to enable these children to learn with the assistance of the teachers-parents.The methodological approach of our solution is based on the use of raspberry pi 3 b+ on which we deploy moodle for all elementary school classes. The solution does not need the Internet or network infrastructure to work. Each student is equipped with a tablet that allows him/her to connect to the digital elementary school platform via Wi-Fi. Teachers recruited and trained in these areas provide the necessary support for children to master the digital tools for their education, and the teaching model is based on active learning. Course content is prepared by qualified teachers and integrated on the platform. This solution contributes on the one hand to the mastery of Information and Communication Technologies for Education by primary school students in a constantly changing technological environment; on the other hand to the improvement of schooling, the consolidation of peace, security and socio-economic development, thus facilitating the emergence of good governance and democracy in Central Africa.","1738-9445","979-11-88428-08-3","10.23919/ICACT53585.2022.9728800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9728800","Education system;conflict zone;digital elementary school;MoodleBox;active learning;Wi-Fi","Education;Buildings;Africa;Transforms;Internet;Information and communication technology;Security","","1","","17","","11 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a case study of using STACK in a third-year mathematical engineering module. STACK is an advanced computer-assisted assessment tool that can automatically mark mathematical equations. STACK is a Moodle plugin that allows students to enter mathematical formulae as answers. It checks if the student's answer is mathematically equivalent to the model answer and can provide hints to the student. Students attempt the same question several times, getting hints with each incorrect attempt. STACK questions were used in three different settings: short practice problems that students did at home; long tutorial sessions that students did in class; a two-hour semester test. This paper reflects on the use of STACK during a semester. It summarises feedback from students that were collected during interviews, it discusses systemic challenges when implementing STACK questions, and it looks at the mark distribution of STACK-based questions. Overall, STACK proved to be a useful formative assessment tool. The immediate feedback allowed all the students to solve all the tutorial problems before the end of the tutorial session. The downside to using STACK during the semester test was that students were became anxious because they immediately knew when their answers were wrong.","","978-1-6654-7528-0","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC54384.2022.9996276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996276","Computer-assisted assessment;STACK questions;STEM assessment","Computational modeling;Tutorials;Mathematical models;Problem-solving;Interviews;Engineering education","","1","","12","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering a huge number of students on every launch of the MOOC, the tutor is not able to serve it alone. The studies associated with the use of teacher’s assistants in online courses are focused on different aspects. However, the former do not address the question connected with the consideration of assistants’ ability to form response to performed works with free response (WWFRs) for the students properly, in detail and close to tutor’s feedback. The response obtained by the student will determine whether the required skills will be formed at him. This problem is particularly serious for engineering education with the presence of a large number of WWFRs: practical works, labs and other works. To cope with this issue, a method of intelligent decision support for assistant selection for checking WWFRs is suggested in the paper. The method contains the steps: the preliminary selection of assistants on eliminating criteria; organization of performance of assessment of works, earlier evaluated by the tutor, by assistants-candidates; definition of the quality of evaluation conducted by assistants-candidates by identifying the degree of similarity of their and tutor’s assessment results, employing text-mining.

We employ a mixed methods approach, combining learning analytics with qualitative data, to evaluate the effectiveness of these incentives on increasing student engagement. A longitudinal overview of resource interactions is mapped through Bayesian network analysis of Moodle activity logs from 204 students. This analysis identifies early resource engagement as a predictive indicator of continued engagement while also suggesting that the new incentives disproportionately benefit highly engaged students. Focus group discussions complement this analysis, providing insights into student perceptions of the pedagogical changes and the module design. These qualitative findings underscore the challenge of sustaining engagement through the new incentives and highlight the importance of communication in blended learning environments. Our paper introduces an interpretable and actionable model for student engagement, which integrates objective, data-driven analysis with students' perspectives. This model provides educators with a tool to evaluate and improve instructional strategies.

A high level of success in education makes it possible to obtain qualified specialists in the future and ensure economic growth. Prediction of success is an urgent task, because a quick response to possible problems allows to increase the student's chances of successfully passing the session, as well as to identify deficiencies that can be corrected. In the work, a study of the accuracy of predicting the success of students based on data on their attendance and grades was conducted. The following machine learning algorithms were studied: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Method, Random Forest. The parameters characterizing the accuracy of the classification are determined, namely: sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy. Based on the obtained results, receiver operating characteristic graphs were constructed to assess the ability of the classifier to correctly recognize positive classes and reject negative classes when the threshold value changes. In order to perform forecasting, data on user ratings and attendance for the first and second semesters of the 2021–2022 academic year were exported from the Moodle electronic learning management system database. The total number of student grade and attendance records exported to files was 1,308,262. The creation of predictive models was performed in the PyCharm development environment in Python using the Scikit-learn library. After performing the calculations, it is determined that the random forest method performs the best prediction of success based on the available input data and has a higher accuracy. The obtained accuracy value of 80% and AUC of 73% indicates the quality of the classification model and good discriminating power of the model. The graph of the receiver operating characteristic for the random forest method shows that it has a clearly defined area under the curve that is more curved up and to the left, which confirms the effectiveness of the model.

This is primarily due to their potential to improve decision-making processes within higher education. This study utilizes Educational Data Mining to suggest a clustering-based approach for classifying students based on their academic performance, specifically focusing on their interactions within Learning Management Systems in blended learning settings. Log data from the Learning Management System Moodle platform was analyzed to determine if valuable insights could be derived from student activities without the need for personal or invasive data. Given the large dataset, Principal Component Analysis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection were employed for dimensionality reduction. Three unsupervised learning models—BIRCH, DBSCAN, and GMM—were then applied to identify distinct student clusters. The results from the comparison revealed that the BIRCH algorithm was the most effective in accurately categorizing students based on their activities. Further analysis of identified clusters revealed a strong correlation between student engagement and academic outcomes, with two high-risk clusters demonstrating the highest dropout rates. To better understand the reasons behind the found clusters, the course duration was subsequently divided into intervals, and standard machine learning methods were applied to predict at-risk students over time, confirming that early identification of at-risk students using clustering is feasible. This study demonstrates the efficacy of non-invasive data collection and unsupervised learning models in predicting student success, emphasizing the importance of temporal and content-specific analysis. The proposed approach leverages clustering algorithms to enhance the understanding of student behavior by identifying patterns and grouping students with similar learning and engagement profiles. This supports the development of targeted interventions that are tailored to specific student needs, ultimately improving retention and success.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3486762","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic and Slovak Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:VEGA-1/0490/22); European Commission ERASMUS+ Program 2021(grant numbers:2021-1-SK01-KA220-HED-000032095); European Union (EU) NextGenerationEU through the Recovery and Resilience Plan for Slovakia(grant numbers:09I03-03-V04-000596); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10736593","Educational data mining;learning analytics;clustering analysis;dropout prediction","Clustering algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Machine learning;Education;Predictive models;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Data models;Analytical models;Standards","","","","25","CCBYNCND","28 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the class ratio within software vulnerability datasets is often highly imbalanced (since the percentage of observed vulnerability is usually very low). Goal: To help security practitioners address software security data class imbalanced issues and further help build better prediction models with resampled datasets. Method: We introduce an approach called Dazzle which is an optimized version of conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP). Dazzle explores the architecture hyperparameters of cWGAN-GP with a novel optimizer called Bayesian Optimization. We use Dazzle to generate minority class samples to resample the original imbalanced training dataset. Results: We evaluate Dazzle with three software security datasets, i.e., Moodle vulnerable files, Ambari bug reports, and JavaScript function code. We show that Dazzle is practical to use and demonstrates promising improvement over existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques such as SMOTE (e.g., with an average of about 60% improvement rate over SMOTE in recall among all datasets). Conclusion: Based on this study, we would suggest the use of optimized GANs as an alternative method for security vulnerability data class imbalanced issues.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-9303-4","10.1145/3524842.3528437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796337","Security Vulnerability Prediction;Class Imbalance;Hyperparameter Optimization;Generative Adversarial Networks","Training;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Generative adversarial networks;Software;Data models;Security","","3","","69","","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Diverse software tools have been created to support MOOC participants by favouring self-regulated learning (SRL). However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding how the different SRL model could be effectively, supported by ICT tools, what model inform in a better way the design of new tools to support SRL process in online setting, how the support of SRL affect the students’ performance in a MOOC environment or what is the best way to integrally evaluate the impact of the tools supporting SRL. In this article, we introduce the design and development process of the Autorregulate tool, a web application that supports self-regulation of learning in MOOCs. This tool is developed within the framework of broader research employing research-based design (RBD) to create methodological and technological tools to facilitate self-regulation in MOOCs. Autorregulate supports seven learning self-regulation strategies: goal-setting, strategic planning, time management, help-seeking, self-monitoring, self-recording (Take Note), and self-assessment, considering the SRL model proposed by Zimmerman. The tool was evaluated in a MOOC created on Moodle, with 224 participants, over three evaluation dimensions: 1) Students SRL to measure the effect of the Autorregulate tool on the self-regulation of the participants’ learning; 2) Autorregulate tool’s usability and usefulness; and 3) Participants’ interactions within SRL services. Results show participants’ high level of self-regulation of learning after the intervention (M=4,3; SD=0,85) according to the online self-regulated learning questionnaire (OSLQ). On the other hand, 92% of participants considered the Autorregulate tool usable, and 97% considered the tool useful.

Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding.

Bell","University of Canterbury, NZ; University of Canterbury, NZ; University of Canterbury, NZ",2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"5 Jan 2024","2023","","","1","9","Randomization is a technique that can be used with programming assessments to discourage academic misconduct by making it unlikely for two colluding students to get the exact same questions. Previous research about randomization has shown it to be an effective tool for addressing academic misconduct, but this work often focuses on randomization broadly, with few considering specific techniques. In contrast, we consider different randomization techniques and the contexts that they are best suited to. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of randomization techniques against emerging AI technologies. This is done by exploring randomization in the context of an online quiz system that evaluates student responses to pro-gramming challenges, specifically the CodeRunner system for the Moodle learning management system. We provide a classification of techniques, and discuss the benefits of each. This classification starts with simpler techniques, such as shuffling question order, shuffling multi-choice question options, and question pooling. We then move on to more advanced techniques, including simple substitution, altering expected output, switching logic, and steganography. We also investigate two approaches to generating randomized questions, considering the benefits and drawbacks of each. These approaches are generating the questions beforehand (pre-generation) and generating the questions when the quiz is started (on-the-fly generation). We then identify four categories of assessment based on assessment that is formative/summative, and proctored/non-proctored, then identify which randomization techniques are suited for each category. Finally, we test randomized questions against OpenAI's Codex, to see if these techniques could prevent this new opportunity for academic dishonesty. We found that there are some types of questions that Codex currently performs poorly on, such as program reasoning, and creating complex classes, but overall randomization was not effective in defeating it, with Codex scoring 79.7% on questions that were created after it was trained, and 85.3 % on questions that could have been available to it when it was trained.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342976","academic integrity;randomization;automatic assessment tools;AI generated code","Steganography;Learning management systems;Taxonomy;Education;Switches;Cognition;Servers","","1","","31","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research works to mitigate these challenges by identifying confusion in learners in online learning platforms by analyzing their posts in course discussion forums. We utilized the Stanford MOOCPosts dataset, evaluated the performance of various ma-chine learning (ML) models, and explored the effectiveness of a custom classification embedding model on the Cohere. This Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform provides access to Large Language Models (LLM) and natural language processing (NLP) tools through an application programming interface (API). Our findings highlight the utility of AI platforms and LLMs in identifying and classifying confusion in online learners.

Using a scoring algorithm to calculate the percentage of each student's attentiveness in the specific class, this system aims to increase the use of artificial intelligence approaches. The graph provided by this tool may be used to measure how well a student understands the material being taught. Data mining tools are increasingly being used in higher education to help students and administrators better understand and resolve educational and administrative difficulties. The majority of educational mining research focuses on replicating students' performance rather than instructors' performance. The course assessment questionnaire is a standard instrument for evaluating teachers' performance based on students' perceptions. There are a number of different ways for creating classification techniques in this system, from decision trees to support vector machines to machine learning techniques, including differential evolution. Comparing their answers to an actual course assessment question based on its accuracy, retention and sensitivity. Students' online conduct has become more accessible because to the use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions. These statistics have been utilized by several studies to predict student outcomes. A wide range of subjects and predictive characteristics collected from the LMS make it difficult to draw generalized statements about the processes that control student performance. To get started let's take a look at some of the most recent research' theoretical foundations and common predictions in the field of learning analytics. A total of 4,989 students took 17 blended courses with Moodle LMS at the same school, and both multi-level and conventional regressions are utilized to examine the impact of LMS predictor factors and between-course evaluation grades on student performance. Despite the fact that they were gathered inside a single institution, our studies demonstrate that the outcomes of predictive modelling varied greatly between courses. As a result, the predictive models' range of motion is constrained. The data from LMS also shows that early intervention and intermediate assessment grades have little (if any) relevance from LMS data.","","978-1-6654-7971-4","10.1109/ICESC54411.2022.9885462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885462","Learning Management Systems;LMS;Learning Analytics;Portability;Student Performance;Predictive Modeling","Support vector machines;Learning management systems;Analytical models;Sensitivity;Process control;Learning (artificial intelligence);Predictive models","","1","","21","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Teachers need support for planning, specification, execution, monitoring, and evaluation of collaborative writing tasks in their course. This requires a collaborative learning platform for coordinating all of the different phases in the writing process. In order to enable the design of such a platform, we created a process model of collaborative writing tasks that is based on the identification of participants, activities, phases, and orchestration from the literature. This model may serve as a basis for teachers to specify the instances for such tasks and can be used to determine the functional requirements needed for supporting model-compliant tasks on a collaborative learning platform. We present a general architecture for a platform of this kind that is independent of a concrete learning management systerm (LMS) system or shared editor and demonstrate its implementation using Moodle, Etherpad Lite, and Docker. The platform makes it easier for teachers to create groups and automatically assign members to collaborative workspaces. It enables asynchronous as well as synchronous text editing and communication. It also respects the European information security and data protection requirements and helps teachers monitor both the writing and reviewing activities. The platform was evaluated over a period of three semesters in distance learning courses with more than 4500 students. It proved a scalable and robust environment for coordinating the collaborative writing process of teachers and students and enables analysis of collaborative writing behavior by teachers and researchers.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3355791","Center of Advanced Technology for Assisted Learning and Predictive Analytics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10403923","Collaborative learning tools;collaborative writing;learning environments;peer reviewing","Writing;Collaboration;Task analysis;Monitoring;Federated learning;Planning;Computer aided instruction","","1","","95","IEEE","18 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research addresses the problem by proposing a solution to generate animated subtitles in the Indonesian Sign Language System, namely SIBI (Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia). The existing method produces word-by-word animations from directly recognized spoken text that are too fast and difficult to follow. We developed a text translation model for the Moodle application to shorten the original spoken text of the educational videos into SIBI text without losing the crucial information. We propose transfer learning to train our transformer-based models and use a custom loss function to ensure alignment with the SIBI dictionary. Pre-trained models mBART50 and NLLB200 were fine-tuned on the SIBIVID-MP12 dataset, which was created in collaboration with Special Education teachers. Experiment results show that the proposed method improves translation metrics significantly, with the best performance observed for the NLLB200 model fine-tuned with our proposed custom loss, achieving sacreBLEU, chrF++, METEOR, and ROUGE-L improvements of 71%, 9.79%, 22.92%, and 14.55%, respectively.

However, few systematic gamification designs are still used to generate character education values. Some studies show that character education values can be developed by elaborating and sharpening some elements in gamification and gamification approach design. Therefore, this research explores information about methods and implementation with a gamification approach to e-learning for character education. This research uses a literature study method with PICOC analysis with data collection using gamification based on character education as the main keyword of the research. The results of this study show that gamification design on e-learning leads more to developing creative character education values and hard work. This is because the application of e-learning with a gamification approach uses existing platforms such as MOOC, Kahoot, Quiz, and Moodle.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which try to tailor each user’s learning by adaptively scheduling problems depend upon learner modelling and the accurate prediction of learner performance to operate. ITSs have led to the availability of large-scale datasets enabling the development of richer models. The classical Bayesian approaches have been overtaken by faster, more scalable and more accurate models like DASH and DAS3H. Despite recent gains in prediction accuracy by NN based models, they are getting increasingly complex and computationally expensive. The issues with the scalability of recent models hinder their widespread adoption in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) which outnumber ITSs by several magnitudes. NN models have very limited transferability. In this paper, the state-of-the-art approach involving Logistic Regression (LR) is examined on 8 public datasets and an alternative system based on variational encoding is presented. The proposed system outperforms the LR model in accuracy for 4 datasets. The new model is applied to the biggest Educational Data Mining (EDM) dataset available and shows that training on such a large dataset is possible without batching, which is not possible by other techniques. The paper focuses on the increase in scalability with a smaller memory footprint (requiring 22.5 ± 7.45 % less memory). The system also had a reduction in runtime for 5 among the 8 datasets. However, the variance in reduction is high with an average of  $10.12\pm 21.55 \%$  reduced run times. The proposed system was developed specifically for lightweight MOOCs with limited Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle. By estimating a learner ability parameter, the proposed system provides richer information to downstream applications like adaptive scheduling. The proposed model retains a high level of interpretability and transferability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3329571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10305078","Intelligent tutoring systems;performance prediction;regression models;stochastic variational inference;learner modeling","Predictive models;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Analytical models;Parameter estimation","","","","58","CCBYNCND","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, these courses have a high failure rate at institutions around the world. At the same time, there has been an increase in the usage of automated feedback tools for programming language courses. These tools present feedback to help the students know if their code is correct or incorrect while studying. This automatic feedback is important for student learning. In this context, this paper presents the AsPin plugin, developed for the virtual learning environment, which uses the student's profile to provide feedback (messages and advice) to personalize their learning. The automatic feedback helps the student understand where they made mistakes, delivers motivational messages so that the student continues to learn, and points to further academic materials so that the student spends more time studying what they need. This feedback is also personalized for the student's profile, as at the beginning of the course, the student fills out a form with basic information, for example, whether or not they already have programming experience and their major. The plugin was developed for the Moodle platform, a free and open-source virtual learning environment with CodeRunner, an automated grader for multi-programming languages. The AsPin plugin was developed for the CS1 course in Python language by students and instructors from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia. The plugin presented in this paper was evaluated by undergraduate students taking different majors, which has a high student acceptance rate.

This type of learning is usually supported by Web-based learning systems such as Massive Open Online Courses (Coursera, edX, etc.) and Learning Management Systems (Moodle, Blackboard-Learn, etc.). However, in this remote context, students often lack feedback and support from educational staff, especially when they face difficulties or challenges. For that reason, this work presents a Prediction-Intervention approach that (a) predicts students who present difficulties during an online learning course, based on two main learning indicators, namely engagement and performance rates, and (b) offers immediate support to students, tailored to the problem they are facing. To predict students’ issues, our approach considers ten machine learning algorithms of different types (standalone, ensemble, and deep learning) which are compared to determine the best performing ones. It has been experimented with a dataset collected from the Blackboard-Learn platform utilized in an engineering school called ESIEE-IT in France during 2021-2022 academic year, showing thus quite promising results.","","978-1-6654-9402-1","10.1109/WI-IAT55865.2022.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101952","Machine Learning;Learning Analytics;Web-based Learning;Students’ difficulties Prediction;Assistance","Deep learning;COVID-19;Learning management systems;Machine learning algorithms;Electronic learning;Pandemics;Education","","","","27","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Knowing this problem, this paper proposes a log analyzer framework that could detect cheating in online EPT exams in real time using log data as the analysis data. While also implementing proactive forensic practices and digital forensics readiness in the system. The waterfall method was adopted to develop the log analyzer framework by developing the capability of data acquisition and replication, identifying features that can indicate cheating, implementing isolation forest machine learning models for cheating detection, and reporting the analysis results from data that can be used for further processing. The functional test of the system states that the log analyzer framework's ability to acquire data, detect cheats, and create reports is functioning successfully. These functions demonstrate the log analyzer's ability to strengthen the security of online EPT examinations.","","979-8-3503-6343-2","10.1109/ICoICT61617.2024.10698253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10698253","log data;machine learning;online English proficiency test;proactive forensics","Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Digital forensics;Machine learning;User interfaces;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;User experience;Security;Strain","","","","26","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Known as the “public cloud,” this model contrasts with the “private cloud,” often perceived as costly and complex to implement. However, when high availability is required, the complexities of both models align, and the costs associated with public cloud services can become prohibitive. This paper explores the technical feasibility and economic viability of deploying private cloud infrastructure using refurbished hardware. It presents a detailed architecture incorporating Canonical MaaS for Metal-as-a-Service (MaaS), OpenNebula for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and Incus for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), with Moodle as the application layer case study. The study finds that private clouds, especially those utilizing refurbished hardware, not only offer a costeffective alternative to public clouds but also enhance security with complete control over data and systems, provide customizable self-management to meet specific organizational needs, utilize existing resources more efficiently for greater sustainability, and ensure technological sovereignty by reducing dependency on public cloud providers. These benefits collectively underscore the strategic advantages of adopting private cloud infrastructures in certain contexts.","2691-0632","979-8-3315-2789-1","10.1109/SCCC63879.2024.10767609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767609","private cloud;high availability;IaaS;PaaS;MaaS","Cloud computing;Hardware;Computer science;Software as a service;Monitoring;Costs;Computational modeling;Sustainable development;Silicon;Security","","","","","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information and communication technologies (ICTs), and computer algebra systems (CAS) in particular, open up new possibilities for the teaching of mathematics, providing dynamic and interactive approaches to the representation of ideas that enable students to explore concepts that, when presented in other guises, are well beyond their capability. The implementation of hybrid learning models, mixing traditional and digital pedagogies, raises major challenges: from choosing the right software to requiring complete teacher training. The COVID-19 pandemic strongly accelerated online education by providing for large-scale usage in learning management systems (LMS) such as MOODLE and CooSpace. These platforms, however, have been instrumental in keeping educational continuity; effective assessment strategies within the online environment still lag. The potential of integrating ICTs and CAS into mathematics education in enhancing student learning outcomes exists but requires surmounting technical, pedagogical, and logistical challenges. The paper explores some of the methods relevant to such questions as the roles of ICTs in experiential learning, the efficacy of hybrid models of teaching, and the establishment of frameworks for assessment online. Grounded in the critical review of current practice and exploration of innovative strategies, this research intends to have added to the discourse on how best mathematics education can be optimized within the digital age so that all students benefit from a comprehensive, engaging, and effective learning experience.","2831-4506","979-8-3315-3111-9","10.1109/CANDO-EPE65072.2024.10772847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10772847","hybrid learning models;mathematics education;online assessment strategies;higher education;computer algebra systems","Training;Learning management systems;Power engineering;Algebra;Reviews;Education;Mathematical models;Software;Planning;Hybrid learning","","","","30","IEEE","10 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

User behavior modeling is essential for understanding relationships in areas such as e-learning and marketing, but most existing methods rely on explicit social interaction data, which are not always available. We propose the User2Vec framework, inspired by the Word2Vec model, to encode user activity into dense vector representations using the temporal co-occurrence of active users. This approach allows the identification of user groups without relying on direct interaction data. The proposed methodology involves preprocessing user activity logs, extracting temporal co-occurrence features, and applying clustering techniques such as k-means and spectral clustering to reveal latent structures. These clustering methods were chosen for their balance of computational efficiency and effectiveness in capturing implicit relationships. The approach is experimented on a dataset from a university e-learning platform, where student logs are processed to cluster users according to their co-occurring actions. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms previous co-occurrence-based methods in terms of clustering accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the significant potential of the proposed framework in applications such as personalized learning and community detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3485553","University of Perugia Project Mixed Reality and AI Methodologies for Immersive Robotics (MiRA); Knowledge and Information Technology Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731703","User behavior modeling;co-occurrence analysis;embedding methods;Word2Vec;user interaction patterns;community detection","Vectors;Encoding;Data models;Context modeling;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Social networking (online);Recommender systems;Adaptation models;Electronic learning;User experience","","","","74","CCBY","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
