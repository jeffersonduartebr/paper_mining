A Micro-Grid Distributed Intelligent Control and Management System,"Micro-grids require active control to maintain quality of service and to interface with the power grid in a bi-directional manner. Further, micro-grids must be justified by environmental, governmental, and economic viability. We present a programmable architecture for active, optimal distributed control of elements of the grid to achieve desired behavior. A unique aspect of this architecture is to include a distributed inductive engine for learning the local dynamics of generators and loads in the micro-grid. It generates feedback laws that are adapted to the current status of the micro-grid, and responds to anomalous events in a resilient manner. An important novelty is that control laws are extracted online for bidirectional discontinuous nonlinear loads by mean field methods from physics outside the standard design methodologies for piecewise linear quadratic controls.","Atigeo LLC, Bellevue, WA, USA; Atigeo LLC, Bellevue, WA, USA; Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA",W.

Learning PLC's with GE3D: The students' feedbacks,"E-learning combines the use of new multimedia technologies and the Internet in order to improve the quality of learning by facilitating access to resources and sources, exchanges and remote collaboration. Today LMS (Learning Management Systems) are quite ubiquitous and choosing one is difficult.

As a consequence, learners and teachers underuse those tools, much worse, students might give up. Following a socio-constructivist approach of learning and the expectations of the students and teachers, we realized a 3D virtual campus (GE3D). The latter allows lectures, e-assessments and exercises, with synchronous connections for users.

Optimal Feedback Control of Pedestrian Flow in Heterogeneous Corridors,"Maintaining the orderliness and efficiency of pedestrian flow through an architectural area is critical for the evacuation process. Especially, clogs and jams are easily triggered in width-changing areas. In this article, we consider pedestrian movement in heterogeneous corridors and design an optimal feedback control to regulate pedestrian flow. Flow characteristics are first studied based on microscopic social-force simulations. A Gaussian process describes the relationship between flow variables with the observation data. The macroscopic model for flow in heterogeneous corridors is developed. To avoid jams, discharges among these corridors are balanced with the narrowest corridor as the primary concern. At the equilibrium, a continuous-time nonlinear control system is formulated, and the adaptive dynamic programming learns the optimal feedback controller. Policy iteration (PI) and neural networks are combined together, and the convergence of neural-network-based PI is demonstrated by analyzing its equivalence to the Gauss–Newton method. Batch normalization is introduced to stabilize the learning process. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the control design can effectively regulate pedestrian flow for both macroscopic and microscopic models. Note to Practitioners—The development of video-processing techniques provides a powerful tool to detect human behavior in real time. In crowd events, the pedestrian movement must be regulated; otherwise, it is easy to fall into the faster-is-slower effect. It is especially important for evacuation routes with different widths. In this article, the optimal feedback control is studied to regulate pedestrian flow in heterogeneous corridors. It takes flow densities as state and produces commands that are composed of entrance influx and free-flow velocities. These commands can be executed with the support of speakers, displays, or the recently developed interactive robots. To avoid congestion, discharges of different corridors are balanced, and the system is optimally stabilized at equilibrium.

It takes flow densities as state and produces commands that are composed of entrance influx and free-flow velocities. These commands can be executed with the support of speakers, displays, or the recently developed interactive robots. To avoid congestion, discharges of different corridors are balanced, and the system is optimally stabilized at equilibrium. Based on our work, engineers are able to design pedestrian flow control and achieve optimal evacuation in arbitrary heterogeneous corridors.",False
Addressing the Cold-Start Problem in Collaborative Filtering Through Positive-Unlabeled Learning and Multi-Target Prediction,"The cold-start problem is one of the main challenges in recommender systems and specifically in collaborative filtering methods. Such methods, albeit effective, typically can not handle new items or users that do not have any prior interaction activity in the system. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step approach to address the cold-start problem. First, we view the user-item interactions in a positive unlabeled (PU) learning setting and reconstruct the interaction matrix between users and warm items, detecting missing links and recommending warm items to existing users. Second, an inductive multi-target regressor is trained on this reconstructed interaction matrix and subsequently predicts interactions for new items that enter the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a two-step PU learning method is proposed to address the cold-start problem in recommender systems. To evaluate the proposed approach, we employed four benchmark datasets from movie and news recommendation domains with explicit and implicit feedback. We compared our method against three other competitor approaches that address the cold-start problem and showed that our proposed method significantly outperforms them, achieving in a case an increase of 16.9% in terms of NDCG.","Itec, IMEC Research Group, KU Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium; Department of Management, Strategy and Innovation, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Itec, IMEC Research Group, KU Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium",A.

Enhancing Adaptive Online Chemistry Course with AI-Chatbot,"This paper presents the design and development of a virtual conversational tutor (AI chatbot) that complements an existing pre-freshman adaptive online Chemistry course. While students acknowledge the fact that the online Chemistry course is beneficial in preparing them for first year Chemistry modules, the overall completion rate of the online course remains low (∼15%) as students cite the lack of immediate response from instructor while attempting the course. To increase the level of student engagement and guide students while completing the online course, an AI chatbot is introduced. The chatbot is designed to replicate the real-time interaction between a student and an instructor. It is worth noting that the chatbot was designed not to answer the questions directly, but rather to scaffold the learning for the students and guide them towards the final answer. Beta testing results shows that students prefer a chatbot that is available 24/7 compared to a tutor that is available at limited scheduled time, as the chatbot caters to the flexibility of students' varying study schedule and preference. Encouraged by the positive results in the Beta testing, the chatbot is scheduled for full deployment in Summer 2021 to serve 280 incoming freshmen. A future study has been designed to investigate at which point students will be able to differentiate an actual instructor in synchronous communication from a chatbot.

Workshop: Visual programming as a bridge to textual programming: managing an integrated Web course with automatic assessment,"The comprehension of algorithms is becoming essential and programming, not rarely, has being introduced since elementary school.

For instance, the integration of a web-based environment with some visual programming tool and automatic assessment could benefit learners.The adoption of a unique environment where the students could learn how to solve problems using algorithms and receive immediate feedback may reduce the slope of the learning curve. Moreover, the possibility of using the same tool to communicate with their teachers and colleagues can positively affect their learning.Also, the visual programming paradigm can reduce the need for memorization of a programming language syntax.

"Preparedness of Blended Education prior to SARS-COV-2 Pandemic via Google Classroom for the fifth Year Medical Students, Otolaryngology Rotation","Background: Generally, we use face-to-face manner as a main method for teaching while some flipped classroom applied online to get more achievement. The Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine(PCM) has introduced the online Google Classroom (GC) to the fifth-year medical students, in the academic year of 2019. The main purpose of the online GC may be applied to the flipped classroom for the fifth-year medical students. Due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic situation at the time of this academic year, each rotation should get a different learning method. Therefore, it appeared that the second to the seventh rotation from total 8 rotations learned by blended education. Face to face manner of teaching was applied first then it was switched to online GC. After that, the eighth rotation came at the same time of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, they were switched to the online GC only. It may be very hard if the online teaching has not been prepared before the time comes. The purpose of this study was to report the result of the application of GC and difference between group of the second to seventh rotation and the group of eighth rotations. How, the first rotation was not included in the study since they had opportunity to learn only face to face procedure. Methods: This is a descriptive prospective study by data collection from 86 medical students of the second to eighth rotations while the eighth rotation studied 100% online. The variable data, including a general information, satisfaction, and tools for accessing the GC were obtained from the questionnaires given to the second to the eighth rotation of the fifth-year medical students. Besides, the daily quiz (DQ) created and evaluated by the second-year residents were preformed and analyzed for the relationship with multiple choice question marks, slide quiz marks, objective structured clinical examination marks and practical marks. Moreover, the questionnaires regarding the comparison between the Google Classroom and the Moodle (MD) were also given to the sixth to eight rotations. Results: From evaluation (of the full mark of 5) of satisfaction and usage, it was found that the satisfaction was 4.7, difficulty to access was 3.2, suitability of DQ was 4.5 as well as the content of pedagogy, bedside teaching and OPD teaching conform with DQ was 4.5. Information through GC was useful by 4.2. Convenience to do SDL through GC was 4.5. Preferring to do SDL through GC was 4.5 and believe that GC could reduce paper consumption was 4.8. Comparison between GC and MD, there were 66.7% (26/39) of students who answered the evaluation with 96.1% preferred GC. Among these, 80.8% thought GC was easier to access, and 76.9% thought GC was more user friendly than MD. Correlation analysis by Pearson correlation, it was found that rotation was related to slide quiz (p = 0.010) and PBL marks (p < 0.001). Those who had more numbers of answering quizzes would gain higher quiz marks (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Using of the blended education to familiarize students, faculty and support staffs with learning management system are important since if 100% online teaching is needed.

Early Prediction of Student Performance in Blended Learning Courses Using Deep Neural Networks,"In this paper, we experimented on developing prediction models for student performance in early stages of blended learning courses using deep neural network (NN) architecture and utilizing online activity attributes as input patterns. The online activity attributes were extracted from the activity logs stored by Moodle. A total of 885 records from undergraduate students taking three 3 different courses under 16 different classes were utilized. First, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the hyperparameters for a top performing NN model which then served as baseline classifier. Afterward, experiments were conducted to test the performance of the model for predicting student outcomes (pass or fail) both for the midterm and finals period using activity data generated prior to the midterm period. Results indicate that only low prediction performance can be achieved at an early stage, more specifically during the first month of the course. However, both accuracy, as well as ROC_AUC score, improves as more data is accumulated up to the third month. This result supports the findings from previous studies. The highest accuracy achieved for predicting finals outcomes for a single course is 91.07% with ROC_AUC score of 0.88 while for midterm outcomes the highest is 80.36% accuracy with ROC_AUC score of 0.70.

LLM-enabled Intent-driven Service Configuration for Next Generation Networks,"Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is a promising paradigm for next generation networks, enabling automated network management based on user-defined business network requirements (Intents). However, current IBN approaches consider that users require expertise in some formal and technical models (e.g., Network Service Descriptors - NSDs) to define these Intents, necessitating substantial effort. A natural progression of IBN systems is to define Intents using natural language instead of structured models. However, dealing with this becomes challenging due to the unstructured and ambiguous nature of natural language. Fortunately, Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very powerful in understanding human language, making them well-suited for this task. This paper proposes an LLM-based Intent translation system that allows users to express Intents in natural language, which the system subsequently converts into NSDs.

A Virtual Ultrasonography Simulator for Skill Training Using Magnetic-Inertial Probe Tracking,"Simulation-based ultrasonography training has been proven to be effective for novice practitioners to acquire operation skills. However, existing simulators are cumbersome, expensive, and sometimes fail to provide intuitive and interactive training experience. In this article, a compact, inexpensive, and interactive ultrasonography simulator is developed using magnetic-inertial 6-degree of freedom (DoF) probe pose tracking and virtual ultrasound image generation. Embedded with magnetic and inertial sensors, the sham ultrasound probe is tracked by fusing magnetic measurement of a single electromagnet embedded in the phantom and inertial measurement of the probe. Then the virtual scan plane is determined according to the estimated probe pose to slice the digital anatomical model for virtual image generation, providing visual feedback for skill training. The probe tracking accuracy is experimentally validated to be sufficiently accurate for correct image generation with the RMS position error of 3.67 mm and average orientation error of 0.74$^\circ $. The interactive performance of the simulator is evaluated by volunteer tests, showing shortened task completion time (40.68 s versus 50.46 s) and slightly improved accuracy of reaching target views compared to the slider control method. It is also shown that an inexperienced operator can learn to successfully acquire standard and diagnostic views of fetal hearts with congenital diseases.

The interactive performance of the simulator is evaluated by volunteer tests, showing shortened task completion time (40.68 s versus 50.46 s) and slightly improved accuracy of reaching target views compared to the slider control method. It is also shown that an inexperienced operator can learn to successfully acquire standard and diagnostic views of fetal hearts with congenital diseases. Due to intuitive freehand interaction, accurate probe tracking, and real-time visual guidance of ultrasound images and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual scene of the probe and anatomy, the proposed simulator can provide immersive training experience for quick ultrasound skill acquirement.",False

On improving conversational interfaces in educational systems,"Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) have drawn increasing interest in education because of their capacity to tailor learning experiences, improve user engagement, and contribute to the effective transfer of knowledge. Conversational agents employ advanced natural language techniques to engage in a convincing human-like tutorial conversation. In solving math word problems, a significant challenge arises in enabling the system to understand user utterances and accurately map extracted entities to the essential problem quantities required for problem-solving, despite the inherent ambiguity of human natural language. In this study, we propose two possible approaches to enhance the performance of a particular CITS designed to teach learners to solve arithmetic–algebraic word problems. Firstly, we propose an ensemble approach to intent classification and entity extraction, which combines the predictions made by two distinct individual models that use constraints defined by human experts. This approach leverages the intertwined nature of the intents and entities to yield a comprehensive understanding of the user's utterance, ultimately aiming to enhance semantic accuracy. Secondly, we introduce an adapted Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency technique to associate entities with problem quantity descriptions. The evaluation was conducted on the AWPS and MATH-HINTS datasets, containing conversational data and a collection of arithmetical and algebraic math problems, respectively.

Dynamics of Zinder’s Urban Landscape: Implications for Sustainable Land Use Management and Environmental Conservation,"Unplanned urban expansion poses significant challenges to environmental sustainability and urban planning. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of Zinder’s urban landscape using Landsat satellite imagery from 1988, 2000, 2011, and 2022.

The random forest classifier, a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify three land use/land cover categories: “vegetation”, “built-up”, and “others”. Zinder’s arid environment is characterized by sparse vegetation, which constitutes a limited but vital component of its landscape. Despite the already sparse vegetation in the area, the findings reveal a 3.5% reduction in vegetation cover between 1988 and 2022, alongside an 11.5% increase in “built-up” areas and an 8% decrease in the “others” category.

Optimal Task Offloading and Trajectory Planning Algorithms for Collaborative Video Analytics With UAV-Assisted Edge in Disaster Rescue,"Researchers have designed UAV-enabled edge servers (UES) to assist smart cameras (ECs) and optimize video analytics performance. However, most prior research neglects the impact of ECs' battery constraint on the system performance, especially in disaster scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel time-slot-based UES-assisted system that aims to conserve energy and extend the overall lifetime of EC networks. Our proposed system operates in discrete time slots, wherein the UES alternates between hovering and serving ECs, or flying to a new position within its coverage area to provide better assistance. To minimize the computational overhead of ECs during hovering and serving within a time slot, we present a new task offloading scheme based on the differential evolutionary algorithm. For optimizing the UES's flying trajectory, we formulate the UES movement as a Markov decision process, taking into account system state changes. Subsequently, we design an efficient UES trajectory planning algorithm using double deep Q-learning.

Data-Free Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,"Deep learning models have the ability to extract rich knowledge from large-scale datasets. However, the sharing of data has become increasingly challenging due to concerns regarding data copyright and privacy. Consequently, this hampers the effective transfer of knowledge from existing data to novel downstream tasks and concepts. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) approaches aim to recognize new classes by transferring semantic knowledge learned from base classes. However, traditional generative ZSL methods often require access to real images from base classes and rely on manually annotated attributes, which presents challenges in terms of data restrictions and model scalability. To this end, this paper tackles a challenging and practical problem dubbed as data-free zero-shot learning (DFZSL), where only the CLIP-based base classes data pre-trained classifier is available for zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a generic framework for DFZSL, which consists of three main components. Firstly, to recover the virtual features of the base data, we model the CLIP features of base class images as samples from a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution based on the pre-trained classifier. Secondly, we leverage the text features of CLIP as low-cost semantic information and propose a feature-language prompt tuning (FLPT) method to further align the virtual image features and textual features. Thirdly, we train a conditional generative model using the well-aligned virtual image features and corresponding semantic text features, enabling the generation of new classes features and achieve better zero-shot generalization. Our framework has been evaluated on five commonly used benchmarks for generalized ZSL, as well as 11 benchmarks for the base-to-new ZSL.

Efficient Expansion and Gradient Based Task Inference for Replay Free Incremental Learning,"This paper proposes a simple but highly efficient expansion-based model for continual learning. The recent feature transformation, masking and factorization-based methods are efficient, but they grow the model only over the global or shared parameter. Therefore, these approaches do not fully utilize the previously learned information because the same task-specific parameter forgets the earlier knowledge. Thus, these approaches show limited transfer learning ability. Moreover, most of these models have constant parameter growth for all tasks, irrespective of the task complexity. Our work proposes a simple filter and channel expansion-based method that grows the model over the previous task parameters and not just over the global parameter. Therefore, it fully utilizes all the previously learned information without forgetting, which results in better knowledge transfer. The growth rate in our proposed model is a function of task complexity; therefore for a simple task, the model has a smaller parameter growth while for complex tasks, the model requires more parameters to adapt to the current task. Recent expansion-based models show promising results for task incremental learning (TIL). However, for class incremental learning (CIL), prediction of task id is a crucial challenge; hence, their results degrade rapidly as the number of tasks increase. In this work, we propose a robust task prediction method that leverages entropy weighted data augmentations and the model's gradient using pseudo labels.

Adaptive Critic Control Design With Knowledge Transfer for Wastewater Treatment Applications,"The wastewater treatment process (WWTP) is of great significance to environmental protection. To improve the efficiency of the WWTP, it is crucial to ensure that the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration tracks the set value efficiently. Due to the nonlinear and time-varying dynamics of the WWTP, traditional control methods cannot accurately control the DO concentration. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes an online transferred heuristic dynamic programming (TrHDP) control design by combining transfer learning with adaptive critic design. First, we use the historical sample data to construct a mathematical model of the WWTP and learn the prior knowledge from the model. Then, the online control process of the DO concentration is guided by utilizing the prior knowledge. In order to avoid negative transfer and save computing resources, we design a novel decay function with the truncation mechanism. In addition, we prove the stability of the TrHDP control scheme by constructing a Lyapunov function. Finally, the performance of the TrHDP scheme is verified by the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1.

A Generative Artificial Intelligence Based Tutor for Personalized Learning,"Personalized learning refers to a system of teaching and learning where the content, methods, and assessment are tailored to each learner's needs, capacities/skills/competencies, and pace. There is abundant literature about personalized learning, describing its advantages, challenges, and approaches to implementing it. This study has explored the abundant literature and realized that while there are substantial proposed ways to achieve personalized learning, these proposals are not implemented into actionable products. This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the 'Custom GPT' component has been implemented and tested on a course named 'Applied Cryptography' in a postgraduate program.

Adaptive Machine Learning-Based Energy Management System for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,"This paper examines the effectiveness of optimizing energy management in hybrid electric vehicles by integrating adaptive machine learning algorithms with the energy management electronic control unit (ECU). Existing traditional rule-based energy management and control strategies of power distribution between internal combustion and battery struggle to adapt to dynamic driving conditions, such as rapid acceleration, frequent stop-and-go traffic, and varying terrain. These scenarios often result in sub-optimal energy utilization and performance, as the fixed rules struggle to account for the immediate demands and inefficiencies that arise in such conditions. In conditions like that, rapid acceleration demands a sudden increase in power, which can lead to inefficient fuel consumption if not managed properly, while frequent stop-and-go traffic conditions can cause the battery to drain and lead to increased fuel consumption. Varying terrain can also lead to improper power distribution, with steep inclines demanding more power from the internal combustion engine than normal terrain. In contrast, the proposed system utilizes real-time feedback from the energy management ECU, based on that it decides the power distribution between the battery and internal combustion engine in the subsequent cycle, ensuring optimal performance across a wide range of driving conditions by efficiently distributing the power between internal combustion engine and battery. In this paper, the approach toward the development of a machine learning algorithm for energy management of hybrid electric vehicles will be shown in MATLAB. The procedure involves data collection from the energy management ECU, including parameters such as battery state of charge (SOC), vehicle speed, engine load, torque, fuel consumption rate, and temperature. This data is then used to extract relevant patterns and relationships. Subsequent machine learning algorithms are selected based on their suitability for the data characteristics and problem requirements and trained using MATLAB. After training, the model will receive real-time feedback from the energy management ECU based on collected parameters. Using this feedback the model decides the power distribution between the internal combustion engine and battery. Results, including metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) regarding fuel consumption and overall fuel consumption rates, will be plotted to validate the system's performance before and after implementing the machine learning model. These results will be plotted on performance graphs to illustrate the improvement achieved.

Auto-Fill: A Synergistic Approach for Surveillance and Fillbase Management of Rod Pumps Using Advanced Machine Learning Models,"Surveillance and adjustments of fillbase and fillage are crucial for optimizing pump performance and maximizing production efficiency. Proper management of fillbase not only promotes longevity by preventing unnecessary wear and tear, but also helps in optimizing fluid handling efficiency, energy efficiency, rod-load management, and overall production of rod pumps. The primary objective of this paper is to propose a comprehensive and automated solution for surveillance and optimal management of fillbase with high number of wells. Our proposed method powered by combination of machine learning models enable efficient, data-driven monitoring and fillbase tuning. The pump cards (Position-Load on the rod) generated by the wellhead controllers along with other operational parameters including pump-speed, wellhead-pressure, temperature, etc. are first processed by a LightGBM classification model to classify cards as good or bad. If the card is bad, the operators are notified to help with supervision and taking remedial actions, and if the card is good, fillbase is predicted by a XGBoost regression model and the values are adjusted automatically based on the predictions. Different machine learning models were assessed for classifying pump cards and predicting fillage and fillbase. The best models with their respective hyperparameters were then tested in the field. These models were evaluated in real-time by senior operation specialists and feedback was collected. The card classification model had an accuracy score of approximately 99% on the test data and showed similar performance during real-time monitoring. The Fillbase model had R2 values of 98% and the fillbase model correctly detected the fillbase setting in around 95% of cases, as confirmed by senior operation specialists and production engineers. The controller calculates the fillage based on the given fillbase setting and there is an average deviation of around 4% from the fillage predicted by our model. The fluid rates recorded by the controllers after adjusting the fillbase were compared to well test rates, and there was a significant decrease (15%) in mean absolute error after implementing the 'Auto Fill' workflow, which serves as a quantitative validation for our models. Additionally, the model can adjust the fillbase settings even in the event of sudden changes in operating conditions, reducing the need for frequent manual interventions by operators. Using data driven systems and powerful machine learning models, the proposed approach aims to automate surveillance and fillbase management, reducing the need for manual effort from operators and production engineers. This process also enhances consistency in setting fillage or fillbase and allows for automated speed control of pumps, improving production and energy efficiency.

Active Learning and New Technologies: Towards Better Learning,"Digitalisation has revolutionised the way many areas of our societies work, but until recently only impacted university education to a limited extent.

Cognitive RAN-Aware Transport Layer for NR-V2X Communications in 5G and Beyond Networks,"The emergence of 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) networks holds tremendous potential for realizing New Radio Vehicle-to-Everything (NR-V2X) applications, which demand high data transfer rates and low latency. While 5G mmWave networks offer a commercially viable platform for the next generation of NR-V2X applications, they encounter various propagation challenges. Unfortunately, the transport layer (L4 layer) between conventional NR-V2X communication endpoint devices remains oblivious to wireless medium issues and congestion scenarios in the Radio Access Network (RAN). This often results in packet loss, transmission delays, and diminished quality of experience. This paper introduces a novel approach to predict congestion or buffer bloat scenarios in the RAN proactively.

Subsequently, this information is relayed to assist Active Queue Management (AQM) in the User Plane Function (UPF), integrating cognitive capabilities rooted in RAN awareness.

Constrained Restless Bandits for Dynamic Scheduling in Cyber-Physical Systems,"This paper develops a sequential decision-making framework called constrained restless multi-armed bandits (CRMABs) to model problems of resource allocation under uncertainty and dynamic availability constraints. The decision-maker's objective is to maximize the long-term cumulative reward. This can only be achieved by considering the impact of current actions on the future evolution of states. The uncertainty about the future availability of arms and partial state-information makes this objective challenging. CRMABs can be applied to resource allocation problems in cyber-physical systems, including sensor/relay scheduling. Whittle's index policy, online rollout, and myopic policies are studied as solutions for CRMABs. First, the conditions for the applicability of Whittle's index policy are studied, and the indexability result is claimed under some structural assumptions. An algorithm for index computation is presented. The online rollout policy for partially observable CRMABs is proposed as a low-complexity alternative to the index policy, and the complexity of these schemes is analyzed.

The decision-maker's objective is to maximize the long-term cumulative reward. This can only be achieved by considering the impact of current actions on the future evolution of states. The uncertainty about the future availability of arms and partial state-information makes this objective challenging. CRMABs can be applied to resource allocation problems in cyber-physical systems, including sensor/relay scheduling. Whittle's index policy, online rollout, and myopic policies are studied as solutions for CRMABs. First, the conditions for the applicability of Whittle's index policy are studied, and the indexability result is claimed under some structural assumptions. An algorithm for index computation is presented. The online rollout policy for partially observable CRMABs is proposed as a low-complexity alternative to the index policy, and the complexity of these schemes is analyzed. An upper bound on the optimal value function is derived, which helps assess the sub-optimality of various solutions.

APPLICATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR AIRCRAFT DEFECT TRACKING IN MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS,"Accurate defect identification and tracking of aircraft components and systems is key to maintaining fleet operational readiness and minimising sustainment costs. Maintainer reports offer a rich data source, with lead indicators of defects able to be found within unstructured natural language text fields. However, maintenance textual reports in present form require manual and often difficult analysis, which limits their use for proactive maintenance and reliability checks. The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches offers a solution to exploit previously under-utilised maintenance reports and complementary sources such as pilot reports. NLP coupled with ML techniques can be used to detect the emergence of recurrent defects and could supplement maintainers in making data-driven decisions. This can enable advanced part ordering and resource planning, helping to reduce aircraft downtime by mitigating effects of supplier lead times. This paper introduces a framework for application of NLP towards technical reports and demonstrates a proof-of-concept version of this NLP framework using a set of maintenance and pilot reports applicable to a mixed fleet of aircraft types operated over a two year period. Analysis of the processed outputs enables identification of early lead indicators that have potential to prevent failures, if actioned early by maintainers.

Personalization of Child-Robot Interaction Through Reinforcement Learning and User Classification,"Social robots offer promising avenues for personalized interactions, particularly in aiding children undergoing minimally invasive surgery who often experience pain, fear, and anxiety. While distraction methods like cartoons have shown an effect, they are not adaptive and lack personalization to each child’s needs. We propose an approach that combines reinforcement learning (for learning a set of baseline policies for different types of users) with user modeling and classification to create personalized and adaptive interactions for social robots with the aim to provide higher engagement and adequate distraction from pain in children. In the proposed approach, first a fixed policy is employed during an assessment phase, collecting data on child-robot interactions for a new user. Next, this data is compared to a set of user models, in order to classify the new user into one of these models and its corresponding policy. The selected baseline policy is used during the next interaction which should take place post-surgery. We conducted experiments to test this approach with simulated user models and our results show that baseline policies perform best with their corresponding user model but also achieve good results for unseen models of users who will interact similarly within the interaction framework.

Method of Improving the Management of Cancer Risk Groups by Coupling a Features-Attention Mechanism to a Deep Neural Network,"(1) Background: Lung cancers are the most common cancers worldwide, and prostate cancers are among the second in terms of the frequency of cancers diagnosed in men. Automatic ranking of the risk groups of such diseases is highly in demand, but the clinical practice has shown us that, for a sensitive screening of the clinical parameters using an artificial intelligence system, a customarily defined deep neural network classifier is not sufficient given the usually small size of medical datasets. (2) Methods: In this paper, we propose a new management method of cancer risk groups based on a supervised neural network model that is further enhanced by using a features attention mechanism in order to boost its level of accuracy. For the analysis of each clinical parameter, we used local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, which is a post hoc model-agnostic technique that outlines feature importance. After that, we applied the feature-attention mechanism in order to obtain a higher weight after training. We tested the method on two datasets, one for binary-class in cases of thoracic cancer and one for multi-class classification in cases of urological cancer, to demonstrate the wide availability and versatility of the method.

Hierarchical Federated Learning in Wireless Networks: Pruning Tackles Bandwidth Scarcity and System Heterogeneity,"While a practical wireless network has many tiers where end users do not directly communicate with the central server, the users' devices have limited computation and battery powers, and the serving base station (BS) has a fixed bandwidth.

We first derive an upper bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS. Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of the clients in order to minimize the controllable terms of the convergence bound under strict delay and energy constraints.

Adaptive Resource Allocation and Service Optimization in the Technical Platform Based on Reinforcement Learning,"In response to the problems of low resource utilization and difficult service optimization in the resource allocation of the technology center, this article adopts reinforcement learning to optimize the adaptive resource allocation and services of the technology center, aiming to improve resource management and service response capabilities through reinforcement learning algorithms and integrated architecture management.

AI Can Help Instructors Help Students: An LLM-Supported Approach to Generating Customized Student Reflection Responses,"This innovative practice paper presents an LLM-supported technique to help instructors respond effectively to periodic students' reflections. Efficient communication between instructors and students is integral to supporting a productive learning environment. Recognizing the significance of understanding students' perceptions and challenges, we present the initial implementation of a system to help instructors analyze and respond to students' feedback promptly and effectively. This research is inspired by and extends prior works where instructors sent progress check emails to students, with some works finding that such communication increased students' motivation. To collect feedback, we administer regular student reflections throughout the semester that capture how students feel about the course and uncover the challenges they face. This regular feedback-gathering approach allows instructors to better track their students' progress and respond to comments throughout the semester to provide guidance. However, reading and responding to each reflection manually in the context of their overall learning experience can be time consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based automated approach that generates tailored, performance-contextualized responses to student reflections that can be used to guide first-contact interventions. The generated reflection responses (GRRs) address issues discussed in student reflections and provide advice, support, course information, and follow-up questions to the students. Additionally, they provide feedback to students based on their accomplishments and behavioral data within the learning management system (LMS), such as submission patterns.

Uncorrelated Sparse Autoencoder With Long Short-Term Memory for State-of-Charge Estimations in Lithium-Ion Battery Cells,"For the safe and reliable operation of battery-driven machines, accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimations are necessary. Unfortunately, existing methods often fail to identify patterns relevant to long-term SOC estimation due to complex battery cell characteristics such as aging. In this paper, we propose the Uncorrelated Sparse Autoencoder with Long Short-Term Memory (USAL). USAL is a novel neural network that addresses the challenging task of long-term SOC estimation given a limited initial history of a cell's charge-discharge behavior. USAL uses a multi-task learning strategy to harness the advantages of sparse autoencoders and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks by enforcing correlation penalties. The USAL simultaneously learns to (i) generate a latent space of informative SOC encodings from commonly measured cell characteristics, (ii) penalize for high multicollinearity between encodings, and (iii) identify non-trivial long and short temporal correlations between the encodings using LSTM cells. USAL outperforms benchmarked models in our experiments when trained on five initial charge-discharge cycles across multiple battery cells using three publicly available accelerated aging datasets. Note to Practitioners - This paper proposes USAL, a custom-built deep neural network to address the challenging task of long-term SOC estimations in battery cells. Long-term SOC estimation involves estimating SOC for cycles near End-Of-Life (EOL) given some initial charge-discharge cycles. Three fundamental steps involved in long-term SOC estimations using USAL are (i) exploiting a multi-task learning strategy to learn efficient encodings given limited training data, (ii) penalizing these encodings for high correlations to efficiently transform measured inputs into a space of informative features, and (iii) mapping of aging-related trends to support long-term SOC estimations. USAL is designed to be a data-driven SOC estimation method that is (i) capable of alerting the user to a faulty cell when integrated into a real-life Battery Management System (BMS) and (ii) identifying the relative quality of a battery cell from only a few initial charge-discharge cycles.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Savargaonkar, Mayuresh University of Michigan-Dearborn, Department of Industrial Manufacturing and Systems Engineering, Dearborn, 48128, MI, United States; Oyewole, Isaiah University of Central Florida, Florida Solar Energy Center, Orlando, 32816, FL, United States","Savargaonkar, Mayuresh and Oyewole, Isaiah and Chehade, Abdallah and Hussein, Ala A.",10.1109/TASE.2022.3222759,UNKNOWN,15455955,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,2024,False,True,True,True,"For the safe and reliable operation of battery-driven machines, accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimations are necessary.

Intelligent personalised learning system based on emotions in e-learning,"One of the greatest challenges in the success of a personalised e-learning system lies in the behaviour identification of the learners during the learning and evaluation phase. The content delivery in an e-learning system must be modified and updated periodically according to the preference and behaviour of the learners. Usually, the behaviour of the learners drastically changes according to their affective states during the learning phase. The accurate identification of the learner’s negative emotions and addressing such emotions carefully in a positive sense can greatly provide success to the learners. In this paper, the learner’s emotions especially frustration emotion are automatically and accurately estimated using the information received from learning management systems (LMS) using the Takagi sugeno fuzzy inference engine. Based on this estimation, several motivational messages are distributed according to the identified emotions which had greatly helped them to succeed during e-learning. The motivational messages that are used for sending to the learners are based on regulatory fit theory. Several kinds of statistical tests are used in this paper for deep analysis. Two sets of learners, namely, control and experimental sets, are identified from undergraduate students.

The content delivery in an e-learning system must be modified and updated periodically according to the preference and behaviour of the learners. Usually, the behaviour of the learners drastically changes according to their affective states during the learning phase. The accurate identification of the learner’s negative emotions and addressing such emotions carefully in a positive sense can greatly provide success to the learners. In this paper, the learner’s emotions especially frustration emotion are automatically and accurately estimated using the information received from learning management systems (LMS) using the Takagi sugeno fuzzy inference engine. Based on this estimation, several motivational messages are distributed according to the identified emotions which had greatly helped them to succeed during e-learning. The motivational messages that are used for sending to the learners are based on regulatory fit theory. Several kinds of statistical tests are used in this paper for deep analysis. Two sets of learners, namely, control and experimental sets, are identified from undergraduate students. Experimental results are shown for these two sets to reveal the increase in their emotional strength after receiving the motivational messages.

Optimizing Virtual Health Technologies Through a Performance-based Readiness Model: Lessons From the Field Deployment of National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network,"Introduction: The advancement of the Army’s National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN) and planned evolution to an Intelligent Medical System rest on a digital transformation characterized by the application of analytic rigor anchored and machine learning. The goal is an enduring capability for telecritical care in support of the Nation’s warfighters and, more broadly, for emergency response, crisis management, and mass casualty situations as the number and intensity of disasters increase nationwide. That said, technology alone is unlikely to solve the most pressing issues in operational medicine and combat casualty care. Materials and Methods: A total performance system (TPS) creates opportunities to address vulnerabilities and overcome barriers to success. As applied during the NETCCN project, the TPS captures the best performance-centric information and know-how, increasing the potential to save lives, improve readiness, and accomplish missions. Results: The purpose of this project was to apply a performance-based readiness model to aid in the evaluation of Army telehealth technologies. Through various user-facing surveys, polls, and reporting techniques, the project aimed to measure the perceived value of telehealth technologies within a sample of the project team member population. By providing a detailed approach to the collection of lessons learned, researchers were able to determine the importance of information and methods versus a focus on technology alone. The use of an emoji-based feedback assessment indicated that most lessons learned were helpful to the project team. Conclusions: Through the NETCCN TPS, we have been able to address product-related measures, knowledge of product efficacy, project metrics, and many implementation considerations that can be further investigated by setting and engagement type. Through the Technology in Disaster Environments learning accelerator, it was possible to rapidly acquire, process, organize, and disseminate best practices and learnings in near real time, providing a critical feedback and improvement loop. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

Towards Understanding the Geospatial Skills of ChatGPT: Taking a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Exam,"This paper examines the performance of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in a geographic information systems (GIS) exam. As LLMs like ChatGPT become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including education, it is important to understand their capabilities and limitations in specialized subject areas such as GIS. Human learning of spatial concepts significantly differs from LLM training methodologies. Therefore, this study aims to assess ChatGPT's performance and ability to grasp geospatial concepts by challenging it with a real GIS exam. By analyzing ChatGPT's responses and evaluating its understanding of GIS principles, we gain insights into the potential applications and challenges of LLMs in spatially-oriented fields. We conduct our evaluation with two models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to understand whether general improvements of an LLM translate to improvements in answering questions related to the spatial domain. We find that both GPT variants can pass a balanced, introductory GIS exam, scoring 63.3% (GPT-3.5) and 88.3% (GPT-4), which correspond to grades D and B+ respectively in standard US letter grading scale. In addition, we also identify specific questions and topics where the LLMs struggle to grasp spatial concepts, highlighting the challenges in teaching such topics to these models. Finally, we assess ChatGPT's performance in specific aspects of GIS, including spatial analysis, basic concepts of mapping, and data management. This granular analysis provides further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT's GIS literacy. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the integration of AI models in education and can provide guidance for educators, researchers, and practitioners seeking to leverage LLMs in GIS.

An interpretable and interactive deep learning algorithm for a clinically applicable retinal fundus diagnosis system by modelling finding-disease relationship,"The identification of abnormal findings manifested in retinal fundus images and diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases are essential to the management of potentially vision-threatening eye conditions. Recently, deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADs) have demonstrated their potential to reduce reading time and discrepancy amongst readers. However, the obscure reasoning of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been the leading cause to reluctance in its clinical use as CAD systems. Here, we present a novel architectural and algorithmic design of DNNs to comprehensively identify 15 abnormal retinal findings and diagnose 8 major ophthalmic diseases from macula-centered fundus images with the accuracy comparable to experts. We then define a notion of counterfactual attribution ratio (CAR) which luminates the system’s diagnostic reasoning, representing how each abnormal finding contributed to its diagnostic prediction. By using CAR, we show that both quantitative and qualitative interpretation and interactive adjustment of the CAD result can be achieved.

Deep-Q Learning for Distributed Spectrum Reuse Maximization in Underlay Cognitive Radio Systems,"In this letter, we consider the problem of maximizing spectrum reuse in an underlay cognitive radio (CR) system where multiple secondary transmitters (STs) are communicating with the respective secondary receivers (SRs) in a device-to-device (D2D) communication fashion, and the CSI is not available at the STs. The problem at hand can not be solved using conventional optimization techniques proposed in the literature because they require CSIs to provide a solution. Hence, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for optimizing the resource allocation at each ST with only a single bit feedback from the respective SR.

Furthermore, in contrast to the existing SISO-based methods of estimator design, this approach considers key attributes, such as disturbance rejection, noise sensitivity, control signal chattering, and loop interaction associated with multiple loops of an MIMO system in an integrated manner. The parameters of the estimator are realized by minimizing a performance index that is representative of the weighted sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions of the MIMO system.

WIP: Using Generative AI to Assist in Individual Performance Feedback for Engineering Student Teams,"Teamwork is a critical component of engineering education, established as both an ABET competency and recognized by engineers in the workforce as one of the essential skills to their work. As a result, team-based learning throughout engineering education has become increasingly popular, especially in first-year programs. Tools such as CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a web-based program used by instructors, help instructors form student teams based on predefined criteria, facilitate peer evaluations to assess individual contributions and performance, and gather general feedback on student teamwork experiences. Other instructors may collect peer feedback through other methods, such as submitted assignments. Theories in organizational psychology highlight the relationship between performance feedback, psychological safety, and conflict management. To purposefully help students develop essential teamwork skills, such as how to manage conflict and build inclusive, psychologically safe teams effectively, it is important that they receive individual performance feedback. However, negative, unfiltered feedback from peers may also escalate unhealthy team dynamics. Consequently, instructors can be hesitant to share peer evaluation scores and comments with students because students may not be comfortable sharing honest, authentic feedback with their peers. However, withholding this valuable formative feedback to students may come at the expense of their individual professional development, especially in devel-oping teamwork skills. Additionally, these project-based learning (PBL) courses tend to be large, and summarizing formative feedback for individual students based on peer evaluations can be time-consuming and perhaps unrealistic with increasing class sizes. To address this need, we present the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system to create individual performance summaries based on student peer responses. The authors present preliminary work from a pilot study that uses generative AI to produce individual performance summaries using CATME data from a first-year engineering course at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We share a sample output performance summary using a generative AI tool, GPT-4 specifically. Our initial findings indicate AI tools, such as GPT-4, can serve as a solution to provide more confidentiality in peer comments by effectively summarizing peer comments and producing individual performance feedback reviews.

As a result, team-based learning throughout engineering education has become increasingly popular, especially in first-year programs. Tools such as CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a web-based program used by instructors, help instructors form student teams based on predefined criteria, facilitate peer evaluations to assess individual contributions and performance, and gather general feedback on student teamwork experiences. Other instructors may collect peer feedback through other methods, such as submitted assignments. Theories in organizational psychology highlight the relationship between performance feedback, psychological safety, and conflict management. To purposefully help students develop essential teamwork skills, such as how to manage conflict and build inclusive, psychologically safe teams effectively, it is important that they receive individual performance feedback. However, negative, unfiltered feedback from peers may also escalate unhealthy team dynamics.

This enables both teachers and students to adjust their teaching and learning methods as needed. This approach paved a way for tutors spent much more time with their slower learners, treated them with more compassion. © 2023, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology. All rights reserved.",False

How to Attack and Defend NextG Radio Access Network Slicing With Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, reinforcement learning (RL) for network slicing is considered in next generation (NextG) radio access networks, where the base station (gNodeB) allocates resource blocks (RBs) to the requests of user equipments and aims to maximize the total reward of accepted requests over time. Based on adversarial machine learning, a novel over-the-air attack is introduced to manipulate the RL algorithm and disrupt NextG network slicing. The adversary observes the spectrum and builds its own RL based surrogate model that selects which RBs to jam subject to an energy budget with the objective of maximizing the number of failed requests due to jammed RBs. By jamming the RBs, the adversary reduces the RL algorithm's reward. As this reward is used as the input to update the RL algorithm, the performance does not recover even after the adversary stops jamming. This attack is evaluated in terms of both the recovery time and the (maximum and total) reward loss, and it is shown to be much more effective than benchmark (random and myopic) jamming attacks. Different reactive and proactive defense schemes such as suspending the RL algorithm's update once an attack is detected, introducing randomness to the decision process in RL to mislead the learning process of the adversary, or manipulating the feedback (NACK) mechanism such that the adversary may not obtain reliable information are introduced to show that it is viable to defend NextG network slicing against this attack, in terms of improving the RL algorithm's reward.  © 2020 IEEE.","Shi, Yi Virginia Tech, Commonwealth Cyber Initiative, Arlington, 22203, VA, United States; Sagduyu, Yalin E.

Implementation of an automated grading tool for phonetic transcription training,"Clinical phonetic transcription is regarded as a highly specialised skill requiring hours of practice for mastery. Although this skill is a critical part of students’ clinical preparation to become speech-language pathologists, students often report feeling unprepared to apply the skill in clinical practice. Previous studies suggest that increased opportunities for practice and timely feedback on transcriptions are needed in order to develop skill confidence. However, providing more opportunities for practice can be impeded by the limited resources to manage the grading of additional assignments. The purpose of this study is to show the implementation of a web-based learning management system (LMS) designed in our labs for phonetics instruction. The Automated Phonetic Transcription Grading Tool (APTgt LMS) was developed to provide a platform for assignment delivery and automated grading of transcription assignments. The APTgt LMS has three embedded IPA keyboards (basic, advanced, and full IPA) and an automated edit distance algorithm modified by phonetic alignment principles, which allows for individualised scoring and visual course-level feedback in an interactive online environment. For pilot testing, student confidence was queried before and after practice opportunities using APTgt. A concurrent mixed methods research design was used to analyse four Likert scale and three open-ended questions.

"Systemic safety inequities for people with learning disabilities: a qualitative integrative analysis of the experiences of English health and social care for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers","Background: Failures in care for people with learning disabilities have been repeatedly highlighted and remain an international issue, exemplified by a disparity in premature death due to poor quality and unsafe care. This needs urgent attention. Therefore, the aim of the study was to understand the care experiences of people with learning disabilities, and explore the potential patient safety issues they, their carers and families raised. Methods: Two data sources exploring the lived experience of care for people with learning disabilities were synthesised using an integrative approach, and explored using reflexive thematic analysis. This comprised two focus groups with a total of 13 people with learning disabilities and supportive staff, and 377 narratives posted publicly via the feedback platform Care Opinion. Results: The qualitative exploration highlighted three key themes. Firstly, health and social care systems operated with varying levels of rigidity. This contributed to an inability to effectively cater to; complex and individualised care needs, written and verbal communication needs and needs for adequate time and space. Secondly, there were various gaps and traps within systems for this population. This highlighted the importance of care continuity, interoperability and attending to the variation in support provision from professionals. Finally, essential ‘dependency work’ was reliant upon social capital and fulfilled by paid and unpaid caring roles to divergent extents, however, advocacy provided an additional supportive safety net. Conclusions: A series of safety inequities have been identified for people with learning disabilities, alongside potential protective buffers. These include; access to social support and advocacy, a malleable system able to accommodate for individualised care and communication needs, adequate staffing levels, sufficient learning disabilities expertise within and between care settings, and the interoperability of safety initiatives. In order to attend to the safety inequities for this population, these factors need to be considered at a policy and organisational level, spanning across health and social care systems.

Educational Process Mining for Discovering Students' Problem-Solving Ability in Computer Programming Education,"Educational process mining is now a promising method to provide decision-support information for the teaching-learning process via finding useful educational guidance from the event logs recorded in the learning management system. Existing studies mainly focus on mining students' problem-solving skills or behavior patterns and intervening in students' learning processes according to this information in the late course. However, educators often expect to improve the learning outcome in a proactive manner through dynamically designing instructional strategies prior to a course that are more appropriate to students' average ability. Therefore, in this article, we propose a two-stage problem-solving ability modeling approach to obtain students' ability in different learning stages, including the pre-problem-solving ability model and the post-problem-solving ability model. The models are trained with Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) on the historical event logs of the prerequisite course and the target course, respectively. With the premodel, we establish the students' pre-problem-solving ability profiles that reflect their average knowledge level before starting a course. Then, the instructional design is dynamically chosen according to the profiles. After a course completes, the post-problem-solving ability profiles are generated by the postmodel to analyze the learning outcome and prompt the learning feedback, in order to complete the closed-loop teaching process. We study the modeling of coding ability in computer programming education to show our teaching strategy.

Immersive Disaster Training Schema Based on Team Role-Playing,"The prevalence of inevitable natural and social disasters is increasing at an alarming rate. With the proliferation of media and Internet technologies, there is a growing awareness of the importance of disaster training. The paper aims to combine the techniques of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and team-based role-playing to demonstrate a comprehensive disaster training schema to help participants practice safety skills and learn proper decision-making skills in the face of disasters. A VR dome and cylinder combined multidisplay system iwDome was used to immerse participants and provide a view of the overall training; the role of each team was presented through the appropriate Head Mounted Display (HMD) and connected desktop. Rather than just being passive spectators or game players, the participants received puzzles in the virtual scenario that required intra-team and inter-team collaboration to be solved. The scenarios applicable to the system were not restricted to a specific type of disaster, but could be customized, revealing significant application prospects. To test the motivation for improvement, a quality assessment and user experience survey were conducted. The results indicate that participants were more engaged through cooperation in the virtual training environment and could achieve greater learning gains.

In situ bidirectional human-robot value alignment,"A prerequisite for social coordination is bidirectional communication between teammates, each playing two roles simultaneously: as receptive listeners and expressive speakers. For robots working with humans in complex situations with multiple goals that differ in importance, failure to fulfill the expectation of either role could undermine group performance due to misalignment of values between humans and robots. Specifically, a robot needs to serve as an effective listener to infer human users' intents from instructions and feedback and as an expressive speaker to explain its decision processes to users. Here, we investigate how to foster effective bidirectional human-robot communications in the context of value alignment-collaborative robots and users form an aligned understanding of the importance of possible task goals. We propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) system in which a group of robots predicts users' values by taking in situ feedback into consideration while communicating their decision processes to users through explanations. To learn from human feedback, our XAI system integrates a cooperative communication model for inferring human values associated with multiple desirable goals. To be interpretable to humans, the system simulates human mental dynamics and predicts optimal explanations using graphical models. We conducted psychological experiments to examine the core components of the proposed computational framework. Our results show that real-time human-robot mutual understanding in complex cooperative tasks is achievable with a learning model based on bidirectional communication.

To empower educators and researchers to advance simulation-based pedagogy, we have developed the Digital Clinical Simulation Suite (DCSS, pronounced ""decks""), an open-source platform for rehearsing for improvisational interactions. Participants are immersed in vignettes of professional practice through video, images, and text, and they are called upon to improvisationally make difficult decisions through recorded audio and text. Tailored data displays support participant reflection, instructional facilitation, and educational research. DCSS is based on six design principles: 1) Community Adaptation, 2) Masked Technical Complexity, 3) Authenticity of Task, 4) Improvisational Voice, 5) Data Access through ""5Rs"", and 6) Extensible AI Coaching. These six principles mean that any educator should be able to create a scenario that learners should engage in authentic professional challenges using ordinary computing devices, and learners and educators should have access to data for reflection, facilitation, and development of AI tools for real-time feedback. In this paper, we describe the architecture of DCSS and illustrate its use and efficacy in cases from online courses, colleges of education, and K-12 schools. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Hillaire, Garron Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States","Hillaire, Garron and Waldron, Rick and Littenberg-Tobias, Joshua and Thompson, Meredith and O'Brien, Sara and Marvez, G.R. and Reich, Justin",10.1145/3491140.3528276,978-145039158-0,UNKNOWN,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,2022,True,True,False,True,"Role-plays of interpersonal interactions are essential to learning across professions, but effective simulations are difficult to create in typical learning management systems.

Solving Dynamic Multiobjective Problem via Autoencoding Evolutionary Search,"Dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP) denotes the multiobjective optimization problem, which contains objectives that may vary over time. Due to the widespread applications of DMOP existed in reality, DMOP has attracted much research attention in the last decade. In this article, we propose to solve DMOPs via an autoencoding evolutionary search. In particular, for tracking the dynamic changes of a given DMOP, an autoencoder is derived to predict the moving of the Pareto-optimal solutions based on the nondominated solutions obtained before the dynamic occurs. This autoencoder can be easily integrated into the existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs), for example, NSGA-II, MOEA/D, etc., for solving DMOP. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed prediction method holds a closed-form solution, which thus will not bring much computational burden in the iterative evolutionary search process. Furthermore, the proposed prediction of dynamic change is automatically learned from the nondominated solutions found along the dynamic optimization process, which could provide more accurate Pareto-optimal solution prediction. To investigate the performance of the proposed autoencoding evolutionary search for solving DMOP, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted by comparing three state-of-the-art prediction-based dynamic multiobjective EAs. The results obtained on the commonly used DMOP benchmarks confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.","Feng, Liang Institute of Advanced Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, State Key Laboratory of Fire Science, Department of Automation, Hefei, 230027, China; Zhou, Wei Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society (Chongqing University), Ministry of Education, Chongqing, 400044, China; Liu, Weichen Chongqing University, College of Computer Science, Chongqing, 400044, China; Ong, Yew-Soon Nanyang Technological University, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Singapore; Tan, Kay Chen City University of Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong","Feng, Liang and Zhou, Wei and Liu, Weichen and Ong, Yew-Soon and Tan, Kay Chen",10.1109/TCYB.2020.3017017,UNKNOWN,21682267,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022,True,True,False,True,"Dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP) denotes the multiobjective optimization problem, which contains objectives that may vary over time.

Covid-related educational policies in action: a system dynamics view,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt a learning-based approach to portray the impact of Covid-19 on state school services in Italy, with a specific focus on the role of street-level bureaucrats and the triggering of co-creative processes. Design/methodology/approach: The study proposes a qualitative system dynamics (or SD) approach describing the implementation of Covid-related educational policies in Italy. An insight model, made of causal loop diagrams, integrates the selected multi-disciplinary literature and institutional sources, secondary data from national and local reports (about Palermo, the fifth largest metropolitan city in Italy) and insights from a panel of school street–level bureaucrats. Findings: The study provides an insight into the impacts of governmental decisions (school closures and the subsequent need to activate distance learning during the first wave of Covid-19) at a local level. Specifically, it portrays the influences of managerial and professional discretion, infrastructural equipment and socio-economic factors favouring/deterring co-creative educational processes. Practical implications: The SD model highlights vicious/virtuous circles in policy implementation and suggests new managerial paths for education, more routed towards public value creation and less attached to bureaucratic procedures and the unquestioning application of performance culture.

Mitigating bullwhip effect in an agent-based supply chain through a fuzzy reverse ultimatum game negotiation module,"Supply Chain Management is frequently regarded as a distributed system whose productivity is mainly influenced by healthy interaction and cooperation among members. Examples of such inefficiencies can be seen in “Demand amplification” referring to asymmetric increase of demands among supply echelons due to both operational and behavioral causes. This paper addresses defective loops of non-cooperation as well as absence of information to manage the dynamics of demand amplification in a four-echelon supply chain; a new agent-based structure is suggested to facilitate the cooperation and coordination among major components and provide a structured context for interactive information sharing. Adequate motivation to share the required information is derived from an automated negotiation between retailer and manufacturer echelons in a four-echelon serial supply model. In doing so, the retailer agent would be encouraged to share customer demand information using Token-Based ordering policy, through a Reverse Ultimatum Game negotiation module. A novel fuzzy approach is suggested in order to cope with ambiguities involved in this negotiation; Numerical experiments prove that the proposed fuzzy negotiation mechanism can warrant the agreement among negotiating parties in nearly half the number of RUG iterations with 30% agreement share. This success in bringing the negotiation parties to an agreement results in the bullwhip effect decreasing by 30% in a four-echelon agent-based supply system. The proposed agent-based supply model which is designed to facilitate this cooperative decision-making process includes some unique innovative features: the knowledge base of the proposed system is able to retrieve and reuse the previous negotiation outcomes, through a gradual learning module. A combination of Case-Based Reasoning and Rule-Based inference mechanisms are applied to facilitate this, so prior cases will be stored in a Frame-Based structure. Eventually, the integrity of the proposed agent-based system is examined through combining Top-Down and Subsets integration approaches and some numerical experiments are provided to confirm the efficiency of the proposed agent-based structure in bullwhip effect management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Shabany Moghadam, F.

Daily Prediction and Multi-Step Forward Forecasting of Reference Evapotranspiration Using LSTM and Bi-LSTM Models,"Precise forecasting of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is one of the critical initial steps in determining crop water requirements, which contributes to the reliable management and long-term planning of the world’s scarce water sources. This study provides daily prediction and multi-step forward forecasting of ET0 utilizing a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and a bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) model. For daily predictions, the LSTM model’s accuracy was compared to that of other artificial intelligence-based models commonly used in ET0 forecasting, including support vector regression (SVR), M5 model tree (M5Tree), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), probabilistic linear regression (PLR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The LSTM model outperformed the other models in a comparison based on Shannon’s entropy-based decision theory, while the M5 tree and PLR models proved to be the lowest performers. Prior to performing a multi-step-ahead forecasting, ANFIS, sequence-to-sequence regression LSTM network (SSR-LSTM), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM approaches were used for one-step-ahead forecasting utilizing the past values of the ET0 time series. The results showed that the Bi-LSTM model outperformed other models and that the sequence of models in ascending order in terms of accuracies was Bi-LSTM > SSR-LSTM > ANFIS > LSTM. The Bi-LSTM model provided multi-step (5 day)-ahead ET0 forecasting in the next step. According to the results, the Bi-LSTM provided reasonably accurate and acceptable forecasting of multi-step-forward ET0 with relatively lower levels of forecasting errors. In the final step, the generalization capability of the proposed best models (LSTM for daily predictions and Bi-LSTM for multi-step-ahead forecasting) was evaluated on new unseen data obtained from a test station, Ishurdi. The model’s performance was assessed on three distinct datasets (the entire dataset and the first and the second halves of the entire dataset) derived from the test dataset between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020. The results indicated that the deep learning techniques (LSTM and Bi-LSTM) achieved equally good performances as the training station dataset, for which the models were developed.

On Modeling LMS Users’ Quality of Interaction Using Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks,"Learning Management Systems (LMSs) have been widely employed following the Covid-19 pandemic. The user modeling of LMS including educators and learners is a point of interest for Higher Education Institutions (HEI), stakeholders and system users. In this work user’s engagement with LMS is modeled using the Quality of Interaction (QoI) indicator under a combined approach of blended and collaborative learning. The present research extends the previous work of ‘Fuzzy QoI’ and ‘DeepLMS’ to develop a generalized model that substitutes the fuzzy logic system with a deep learning model. In this line, Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (T-CNN) were used to predict QoI, achieving MAE (0.027), RMSE (0.066) and R2 (0.698). The feedback received from the T-CNN model provides insights to educators and stakeholders in order to enhance the pedagogical experience. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Awad, Abdulrahman Department of Biomedical Engineering, Khalifa University, P.O.

Assessing Impact of Carbon-smart Farming Practices in Rice with Mobile Crowdsensing,"Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is an important constituent of measures that govern soil health. Sequestration of carbon in the soil is a major growing focus of sustainability initiatives world-wide to reduce carbon footprint in the atmosphere and counter the effects of global warming. India is the world's largest rice producer by area, estimated at about 44.0 million hectares. Sustainable crop and land management practices play a crucial role in enabling more carbon to be absorbed by the soils and potentially generate carbon-credits which could be traded. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) can play a pivotal role in this by serving as a channel to acquire the data and generate insights to take in-season decisions and get a compliance-view on carbon-smartness of farm-operations. We present our study to digitally assess through crowdsensing the carbon smartness and stock of different agricultural fields in the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ) of Tamil Nadu, India. A set of ten selected farmers were divided into two observation groups CSCP-1 and CSCP-2. CSCP-1 followed organic practices and CSCP-2 followed integrated nutrient management practices with inorganic components. AI in the form of imaging with deep learning was used to validate across both the groups the granularity of operations like tillage that have a significant impact on the level of carbon sequestration. A process model approach was used to simulate the temporal changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) for all the farmers to serve as a continuous feedback on carbon footprint in response to operations reported. SOC levels were obtained for the entire rice season including pre-sowing and post-harvest periods where CSCP-1 farmers sequestrated more carbon than CSCP-2 farmers in general. Results showed an increase of 0.51 tC/ha in carbon stock for CSCP-1 farmers at the end of the season while the corresponding increase was 0.23 tC/ha for CSCP-2 farmers. Within the CSCP-2 group that adopted inorganic practices, farmers following intensive tillage sequestrated even less soil organic carbon at 0.17 tC/ha.

Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Radio Resource Allocation and Beam Management under Location Uncertainty in 5G mm Wave Networks,"Millimeter Wave (mmWave) is an important part of 5G new radio (NR), in which highly directional beams are adapted to compensate for the substantial propagation loss based on UE locations.

The numerical experiment results also show the stability of the instructional design, overcoming the drawbacks of traditional manual subjectivity in the design. AI-driven college education and teaching system is conducive to cultivating students' solid technical theoretical foundation. Therefore, through the AI-driven teaching system to strengthen the training of practical ability, so as to comprehensively improve students' comprehensive quality and innovation ability. © 2022 Fan Zhang.",False
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve chronic pain care: Evidence of AI learning,"Objective: We examined whether Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) driven by artificial intelligence (i.e., AI-CBT-CP) increased its effectiveness through patient interactions. Materials and methods: Data included 11,133 interactions with 168 patients receiving 10 weeks of AI-CBT-CP as part of a comparative effectiveness trial. Each week for each patient, AI-CBT-CP selected among three treatment recommendations: a 45-minute or 15-minute “live” therapy session, or asynchronous therapist feedback delivered via an interactive voice response (IVR) call. Recommendations were based on patients’ progress collected via IVR. AI-CBT-CP sought to optimize a “reward function” reflecting changes in patient-reported pedometer step counts and pain-related interference. We estimated changes over time in the frequency of each session type recommendation and the magnitude of reward scores. Simulations were used to predict increases in program effectiveness if AI-CBT-CP experienced more patient interactions than occurred during the trial. Results: AI-CBT-CP had sufficient data to make recommendations 94% of the time. Recommendations evolved over time, with different patterns across patient subgroups and over patients’ course of therapy. As AI-CBT-CP gained experience via patient interactions, reward-scores increased significantly. In the model predicting reward based solely on calendar week, expected reward scores increased from 0.2949 at the beginning of the trial to 0.4637 in the 100th week of interaction (p","Piette, John D.

"A self-regulated learning management system: Enhancing performance, motivation and reflection in learning","Practising self-regulated learning is essential in one’s lifelong learning journey. As educators, we can assist our students to regulate their learning effectively, whether this is in an online learning environment or any other. However, many factors affect how well learners regulate their learning. Research reveals that self-regulated learning practices vary and warrant further exploration. This study specifically investigates how the guided practice of self-regulated learning behaviour affects learning in the online learning environment. To guide students in managing their learning more effectively, an automated self-regulated learning management system was developed. The system assists students in practising the cognitive, meta-cognitive and motivational aspects of self-regulated learning. 155 postgraduate students in two online healthcare-related courses were randomly selected to be involved in the study. Trace data from the self-regulated learning management system was used to triangulate the students’ self-reports in relation to their self-regulated learning behaviours. Non-parametric statistical tests were used in the analysis. Findings indicate that the use of the self-regulated learning management system facilitated and aided students in practising more effective self-regulated learning behaviours thus impacting positively on learning motivation and metacognitive reflection. However, its effect is inconclusive in relation to academic performance. In summary, positive changes were made to their self-regulated learning behaviours and these subsequently improved their self-regulation and related outcomes. Practitioner Notes 1. Educators should not assume that all adult students are self-regulated learners with effective study skills. 2. Guiding adult students through the learning and application of self-regulated learning skills within the course of study can help them in their learning process, especially in an online learning environment. 3.

A Novel Neural Network With Gaussian Process Feedback for Modeling the State-of-Charge of Battery Cells,"Although several state-of-charge (SOC) estimation methods have been proposed at the battery cell level, limited work has been done to identify the effect of cell aging on SOC estimations. To address this challenge, this article proposes a novel method for estimating the SOC of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells by accurately modeling the cell aging and degradation information. The proposed method, termed as 'NNGP,' is a deep neural network with Gaussian process feedback. The novel Gaussian process feedback helps the NNGP correlate SOC trends over consecutive charge-discharge cycles. Instead of time, the NNGP leverages available energy to correlate these SOC trends. The deep neural network within the NNGP then utilizes this information and other measured inputs to capture long-term cell aging and degradation trends. The NNGP leverages the most recent cell information to adapt its weights and estimate the SOC by employing an adaptive weighted training strategy. In our experiments on four Li-ion battery cells from three publicly available accelerated aging datasets, the NNGP clearly outperforms other benchmarked methods. The NNGP is also shown to be a useful prognostic tool capable of accurately estimating the SOC for up to 25 cycles in the future with an MAE below 3.5%. When tested under dynamic driving conditions and unknown initial SOC, the NNGP is shown to offer considerable improvements over other state-of-art methods.

"Development, Validation, and Implementation of a Guideline to Improve Clinical Event Debriefing at a Level-I Adult and Level-II Pediatric Trauma Center","Objective: Clinical event debriefing is recommended by the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council, because debriefings improve team performance. The purpose here was to develop and validate tools needed to overcome barriers to debriefing in the emergency department. Method: This quality improvement project was conducted in 4 phases. Phase 1: Current evidence related to debriefing in the emergency department was reviewed and synthesized to inform an iterative process for drafting the debriefing guideline and instrument for documentation. Phase 2: Content Validity Index of the tools was evaluated by obtaining ratings of items’ clarity and relevance from 5 national experts in 2 rounds of review. On the basis of experts’ feedback, tools were revised, and a Facilitators’ Guide was created. Phase 3: The validated debriefing tools were implemented. Phase 4: Debriefing facilitators completed a survey about their experience with using the new tools. Results: The Content Validity Index of 71 debriefing tool items (guideline, instrument, Facilitators’ Guide) was 0.93 and 0.96 for clarity and relevance, respectively. Of the 32 debriefings conducted during the first 8 weeks of implementation, 53% described patient safety concerns, and 97% described recommendations to improve performance.

'Forced to think' - An analysis of how students benefit from online warm-up exercises with feedback,"Active learning yields better learning outcomes than traditional, lecture-based teaching. Common approaches in large lecture courses are activating elements during the lectures and warm-up activities using online learning environments. However, implementing warm-up exercises, on which students work on by themselves makes formative feedback increasingly important. We have studied students' views on warm-up online exercises, focusing on the role of automated feedback. We compared two types of feedback: feedback which guided the student towards the correct answer and feedback that guided the student towards the correct reading materials. We have also examined the correlation between students' views on the exercises and learning outcomes, as measured by exercise and exam points. The exercises were administered with a Moodle-based system focusing on teaching and assessment using a computer-based algebra kernel. The study was conducted during the first introductory mechanics course in physics at the University of Helsinki. We concluded that the preferred type of feedback was dependent on the student, i.e. different students prefer different kinds of feedback. Importantly, the students who completed the exercises alone reported benefiting more from them, which shows that the warm-up exercises successfully extended support for students outside of classroom hours.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Kulmala, Kimmo Department of Physics, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Design and Implementation of a Criticality- And Heterogeneity-Aware Runtime System for Task-Parallel Applications,"Heterogeneous multiprocessing (HMP) is an emerging technology for high-performance and energy-efficient computing. While task parallelism is widely used in various computing domains, such as embedded, big-data, and machine-learning computing domains, it still remains unexplored to investigate the efficient runtime support that effectively utilizes the criticality of the tasks of the target application and the heterogeneity of the underlying HMP system with full resource management. To bridge this gap, we propose CHRT, a criticality- and heterogeneity-aware runtime system for task-parallel applications. CHRT dynamically estimates the performance and power consumption of the target task-parallel application and robustly manages the full HMP system resources (i.e., core types, counts, and voltage/frequency levels) to maximize the overall efficiency. Our quantitative evaluation based on widely-used task parallel benchmarks and two full HMP systems (i.e., the XU3 and HiKey970 HMP systems) demonstrates the effectiveness of CHRT in that CHRT achieves significantly higher energy (e.g., 60.4 and 57.2 percent on average on the XU3 system) and energy-delay product (e.g., 52.2 and 44.0 percent on average on the HiKey970 system) efficiency than the baseline runtime system that employs the breadth-first scheduler and the state-of-the-art criticality-aware runtime system and incurs low performance overheads. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Han, Myeonggyun Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence, UNIST, Ulsan, South Korea","Han, Myeonggyun and Park, Jinsu and Baek, Woongki",10.1109/TPDS.2020.3031911,UNKNOWN,10459219,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2021,True,True,False,True,"Heterogeneous multiprocessing (HMP) is an emerging technology for high-performance and energy-efficient computing.

First, our students face great demands on acquiring JDBC acknowledge, and providing them with constructive feedback serves a critical role. Second, the increasing number of students leads to high efforts in managing and grading their assignments. Finally, we consider of strategic importance to bring modern industrial SE techniques into the classroom, so that students obtain a better experience with industry practices.

Defining the Zostera marina (Eelgrass) Niche from Long-Term Success of Restored and Naturally Colonized Meadows: Implications for Seagrass Restoration,"Seagrass restoration can help reverse global meadow loss and restore ecosystem services, including habitat provision for commercial fish and shellfish, carbon sequestration, and improved water quality. However, restoration projects are generally expensive, and site selection remains a challenge due to uncertainty about how environmental variables affect the survival and spread of seedlings. Long-term Zostera marina (eelgrass) success/failure and expansion data from the Virginia Coast Reserve can be used to determine whether the factors that control seedling survival also explain the regional distribution of seagrass meadows. We tracked plant survival and failure within restoration plots and at natural recruitment sites from 2001 to 2015 and used machine learning methods to identify the relative importance of multiple environmental predictors, including water residence time, fetch distance, water temperature, depth, and sediment grain size. Low water residence time was the best predictor of survival, but short fetch length best explained the natural recruit distribution, consistent with hydrodynamic control of seed dispersal. Restoration plot data suggests that the eelgrass fundamental niche covers > 100 km2 within this system, triple both the current extent and the realized niche predicted by the observed natural spread. Our results corroborate historical records that eelgrass was formerly widespread in areas where it has not spread naturally, likely due to insufficient seed delivery. Additional seeding in these areas would, therefore, increase total seagrass coverage and accelerate recovery. Mapping the total habitable area can help managers maximize the extent of seagrass and other bottom uses, including shellfish aquaculture. © 2021, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Oreska, Matthew P.

A data augmentation-based evaluation system for regional direct economic losses of storm surge disasters,"The accurate prediction of storm surge disasters’ direct economic losses plays a positive role in providing critical support for disaster prevention decision-making and management. Previ-ous researches on storm surge disaster loss assessment did not pay much attention to the overfitting phenomenon caused by the data scarcity and the excessive model complexity. To solve these prob-lems, this paper puts forward a new evaluation system for forecasting the regional direct economic loss of storm surge disasters, consisting of three parts. First of all, a comprehensive assessment index system was established by considering the storm surge disasters’ formation mechanism and the corresponding risk management theory. Secondly, a novel data augmentation technique, k-nearest neighbor-Gaussian noise (KNN-GN), was presented to overcome data scarcity. Thirdly, an ensemble learning algorithm XGBoost as a regression model was utilized to optimize the results and produce the final forecasting results. To verify the best-combined model, KNN-GN-based XGBoost, we conducted cross-contrast experiments with several data augmentation techniques and some widely-used ensemble learning models. Meanwhile, the traditional prediction models are used as baselines to the optimized forecasting system. The experimental results show that the KNN-GN-based XGBoost model provides more precise predictions than the traditional models, with a 64.1% aver-age improvement in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) measurement. It could be noted that the proposed evaluation system can be extended and applied to the geography-related field as well. © 2021 by the authors.

Digital communication tools and knowledge creation processes for enriched intellectual outcome—experience of short-term E-learning courses during pandemic,"Social isolation during the pandemic contributed to the transition of educational processes to e-learning. A short-term e-marketing education program for a variety of students was introduced in May 2020 and is taught entirely online. A survey was conducted regularly in the last week of training using Google Forms, and three cohorts were surveyed in July, September, and December 2020. A high level of satisfaction indicates an interest in the content and a positive assessment of the level of comfort of an organization adapted to the needs of students; this positive result contrasted with the negative opinion of the remote learning in Russia since March 2020, and this surprising satisfaction of students has motivated the study to try to explain its reasons. This result was compared with the short-term course taught through the educational pedagogical platform of a university. The students of traditional short-and long-term university programs were asked to assess their satisfaction with different digital communication tools used for e-learning. They showed low satisfaction with the pedagogical platform and a positive reaction to the e-communication tools (messengers, social media, short surveys, video conferences, etc.).

Opportunities for Reinforcement Learning in Industrial Automation,"With the development of technology and the increasingly fierce competitive environment, the manufacturing system becomes more and more complex and requires higher coordination. Manufacturing companies are facing the challenge of highly non-linear and flexible business requirements, while the current degree of automation in the smart era has been unable to meet the needs of the environment. In the next stage, the leading manufacturing enterprises should focus on the application of digitalization and even intelligence in the automated manufacturing industry. Additionally, the successful implementation of intelligent applications in the industry and the realization of their ideal value are also the part that researchers must consider. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has shown that there is great potential to change the manufacturing field through advanced intelligent system tools, especially through reinforcement learning (QL). Therefore, the focuses of this article have been shown as follows: (1) Review the practical application of recent reinforcement learning in various fields, especially in the industrial field. (2) Analyze the method of reinforcement learning applied in industrial applications and its unique performance. (3) Identify the challenges and opportunities for further application of reinforcement learning in automated manufacturing, and discuss the future development of reinforcement learning to better meet the needs of intelligent manufacturing. In order to achieve these goals, this article uses a large number of literature reviews to elaborate a hierarchical analysis of the extensive practice of reinforcement learning in industrial applications. Through these analyses, we try to find the applicability of reinforcement learning in automated manufacturing systems. In addition, we take industrial process systems, human-machine assistance supervision and control, process monitoring, prevention and post-processing, and finally full material process management into consideration, and hope to achieve the desired characteristics in the process and control of the automated manufacturing industry. © 2021 IEEE.","Xin, Quan Nanhu Lab, Jiaxing, 314001, China; Wu, Guanlin National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410000, China; Fang, Wenqi Academy of Military Science, Beijing, 100020, China","Xin, Quan and Wu, Guanlin and Fang, Wenqi and Cao, Jiang and Ping, Yang",10.1109/BigDIA53151.2021.9619637,978-166542466-0,UNKNOWN,"Proceedings - 2021 7th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics, BigDIA 2021",2021,True,False,True,True,"With the development of technology and the increasingly fierce competitive environment, the manufacturing system becomes more and more complex and requires higher coordination.

Additionally, the successful implementation of intelligent applications in the industry and the realization of their ideal value are also the part that researchers must consider. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has shown that there is great potential to change the manufacturing field through advanced intelligent system tools, especially through reinforcement learning (QL). Therefore, the focuses of this article have been shown as follows: (1) Review the practical application of recent reinforcement learning in various fields, especially in the industrial field. (2) Analyze the method of reinforcement learning applied in industrial applications and its unique performance. (3) Identify the challenges and opportunities for further application of reinforcement learning in automated manufacturing, and discuss the future development of reinforcement learning to better meet the needs of intelligent manufacturing. In order to achieve these goals, this article uses a large number of literature reviews to elaborate a hierarchical analysis of the extensive practice of reinforcement learning in industrial applications. Through these analyses, we try to find the applicability of reinforcement learning in automated manufacturing systems. In addition, we take industrial process systems, human-machine assistance supervision and control, process monitoring, prevention and post-processing, and finally full material process management into consideration, and hope to achieve the desired characteristics in the process and control of the automated manufacturing industry. © 2021 IEEE.",False
Virtual Agents for Real Teachers: Applying AI to Support Professional Development of Proportional Reasoning,"Despite the critical role of teachers in the educational process, few advanced learning technologies have been developed to support teacher-instruction or professional development. This lack of support is particularly acute for middle school math teachers, where only 37% felt well prepared to scaffold instruction to address the needs of diverse students in a national sample. To address this gap, the Advancing Middle School Teachers’ Understanding of Proportional Reasoning project is researching techniques to apply pedagogical virtual agents and dialog-based tutoring to enhance teachers’ content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. This paper describes the design of a conversational, agent-based intelligent tutoring system to support teachers’ professional development. Pedagogical strategies are presented that leverage a virtual human facilitator to tutor pedagogical content knowledge (how to teach proportions to students), as opposed to content knowledge (understanding proportions). The roles for different virtual facilitator capabilities are presented, including embedding actions into virtual agent dialog, open-response versus choice-based tutoring, ungraded pop-up sub-activities (e.g. whiteboard, calculator, notetaking). Usability feedback for a small cohort of instructors pursuing graduate studies was collected. In this feedback, teachers rated the system ease of use and perceived usefulness moderately well, but also reported confusion about what to expect from the system in terms of flow between lessons and support by the facilitator. © 2021by the authors.

Boosting HSE Management More Efficiently and Sustainably: How Innovation Can Bring Change in Traditional HSE Mindsets?,"As a part of laboratory Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management system, the working environment control is applied to eliminate various occupational hazards for workers. This control is a continuous effort in our petroleum R&D laboratory as the working environment management system. As an element in the management system, workplace inspection has been taken into the regular HSE activity. Even traditional and well established, the workplace inspection has been continuously improved and optimized from various aspect of inspection design, inspection members selection, check list, and feedback. To make the continual improving practices more practical and effective, workplace features such as laboratory specific environment and ad-hoc research programs have been incorporated into the inspection design. All findings are summarized immediately after every inspection, and subsequently which types of risks hidden in the findings and necessary corrective actions are discussed. All of them: findings, risks, and corrective measures should be swiftly shared with all employees in the workplace. A check list format has been optimized from both aspects of easier recording by inspectors and correctly feedback to responsible personnel to take right counter measures. The paper analyses a large data of workplace inspection results in recent 10 years. The analysis reveals that hazardous sources are decreasing in recent years because of maturity of HSE culture in our laboratory. A combined cycle of inspection activity and data analysis would be useful for understanding the current status of working environment control and considering further updating plan.

Modeling and Predicting Online Learning Activities of Students: An HMM-LSTM based Hybrid Solution,"With significant increase in popularity of online education, need for educators to get to know about learning experiences of students and to provide feedback to students has also been increasing.

Development and Implementation of an Online Adaptive Gamification Platform for Learning Computational Thinking,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning.

Analysing students' interaction sequences on Moodle to predict academic performance,"As e-Learning systems have become gradually prevalent, forcing a (sometimes needed) physical distance between lecturers and their students, new methods need to emerge to fill this enlarging gap. Educators need, more than ever, systems capable of warning them (and the students) of situations that might create future problems for the learning process. The capacity to give and get feedback is naturally the best way to overcome this problem. However, in e-learning contexts, with dozens or hundreds of students, the solution becomes less simple. In this work we propose a system capable of continuously giving feedback on the performance of the students based on the interaction sequences they undertake with the LMS.

Development of Rule-Based Software Risk Assessment and Management Method with Fuzzy Inference System,"There is an enormous budget and financial plan in software development projects, and it is required that they take a huge investment to carry on. When looked at, the costs depend on the global substantial information about software development: in 1985, $150 billion; in 2010, $2 trillion; in 2015, $5 trillion; and in 2020, over $7 trillion. Additionally, on the first new days of 2021, a day-by-day Apple Store's quantity has been approximately $500 million. In spite of the expenditures and the margins that are dramatically expanding and increasing each year, the phase of software development accomplishment is not high enough. In light of the ""CHAOS""report arranged in 2015, just 17% of the software projects were finished in an opportune way, in the allotted financial plan, and as per the necessities. However, 53% of the software projects were finished in the long run or potentially over a spending plan as well as without satisfying the prerequisites precisely. In addition, software development projects were not completed and were dropped out as well in the ratio of 30%. Also, the ""CHAOS""report published in 2020 has figured out that only 33% of the software projects were completed successfully all over the world. In order to cope with these unsuccessful and failure results, an effective method for software risk assessment and management has to be specified, designated, and applied. In this way, before causing trouble that has the power of preventing successful accomplishment of software development projects, software risks are able to be noticed and distinguished on time. In this study, a new and original rule set, which could be used and carried out effectively in software risk assessment and management, has been designed and developed based on the implementation of fuzzy approached technique integrated with machine learning algorithm - Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). By this approach and technique, machines (computers) are able to create several software risk rules not to be seen, not to be recognized, and not to be told by human beings. In addition, this fuzzy inference approach aims to decrease risks in the software development process in order to increase the success rate of the software projects.

By this approach and technique, machines (computers) are able to create several software risk rules not to be seen, not to be recognized, and not to be told by human beings. In addition, this fuzzy inference approach aims to decrease risks in the software development process in order to increase the success rate of the software projects. Also, the experimental results of this approach show that rule-based software risk assessment and management method has a valid and accurate model with a high accuracy rate and low average testing error. © 2021 Mustafa Batar et al.",False
"Intelligent Mentoring Bots in Learning Management Systems: Concepts, Realizations and Evaluations","Mentoring students in online courses is an essential task to keep students on track. Often, they ask simple questions or have repetitive issues. However, due to a high resource demand, this task is difficult to achieve on a massive scale. Digitizing mentoring processes has a high potential to fill this resource gap. In this paper, we present the concept, implementation and evaluation of intelligent mentoring bots. These bots are implemented as chatbots that can be integrated into learning management systems. With these bots, we enable 24/7 mentoring support for students. Students can ask Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding their general studies or about one of their current classes. Further, we integrate external learning applications with the bots to provide personalized feedback to students. The realization of the chatbots is based on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to identify the respective intent of the student. We apply those chatbots as an additional offer in university courses and evaluate them in this context. We see the potential of bots as a scalable solution for mentoring in online courses. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Neumann, Alexander Tobias RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; de Lange, Peter Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany","Neumann, Alexander Tobias and de Lange, Peter and Klamma, Ralf and Pengel, Norbert and Arndt, Tamar",10.1007/978-3-030-66906-5_1,978-303066905-8,03029743,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2021,True,True,False,True,"Mentoring students in online courses is an essential task to keep students on track.

A microservice-driven collaborative agent in virtual learning environments: A role model for a tracing agent,"Currently, distance learning comprises almost half of students enrolled in undergraduate courses in Brazil. However, the dropout rate of this modality is over 50%, and only 22% of students complete the courses [27].

Feasibility of Ultra-Rapid Exome Sequencing in Critically Ill Infants and Children with Suspected Monogenic Conditions in the Australian Public Health Care System,"Importance: Widespread adoption of rapid genomic testing in pediatric critical care requires robust clinical and laboratory pathways that provide equitable and consistent service across health care systems. Objective: To prospectively evaluate the performance of a multicenter network for ultra-rapid genomic diagnosis in a public health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive feasibility study of critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions treated at 12 Australian hospitals between March 2018 and February 2019, with data collected to May 2019. A formal implementation strategy emphasizing communication and feedback, standardized processes, coordination, distributed leadership, and collective learning was used to facilitate adoption. Exposures: Ultra-rapid exome sequencing. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report. The secondary outcomes were the molecular diagnostic yield, the change in clinical management after the ultra-rapid exome sequencing report, the time from hospital admission to the laboratory report, and the proportion of laboratory reports returned prior to death or hospital discharge. Results: The study population included 108 patients with a median age of 28 days (range, 0 days to 17 years); 34% were female; and 57% were from neonatal intensive care units, 33% were from pediatric intensive care units, and 9% were from other hospital wards. The mean time from sample receipt to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 3.3 days (95% CI, 3.2-3.5 days) and the median time was 3 days (range, 2-7 days). The mean time from hospital admission to ultra-rapid exome sequencing report was 17.5 days (95% CI, 14.6-21.1 days) and 93 reports (86%) were issued prior to death or hospital discharge. A molecular diagnosis was established in 55 patients (51%). Eleven diagnoses (20%) resulted from using the following approaches to augment standard exome sequencing analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis, exome sequencing-based copy number analysis, use of international databases to identify novel gene-disease associations, and additional phenotyping and RNA analysis. In 42 of 55 patients (76%) with a molecular diagnosis and 6 of 53 patients (11%) without a molecular diagnosis, the ultra-rapid exome sequencing result was considered as having influenced clinical management. Targeted treatments were initiated in 12 patients (11%), treatment was redirected toward palliative care in 14 patients (13%), and surveillance for specific complications was initiated in 19 patients (18%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests feasibility of ultra-rapid genomic testing in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected monogenic conditions in the Australian public health care system.

It applies a kNN (k-Nearest Neighbour) algorithm to forecast energy demand and supply and presents the results in an interactive visual dashboard that allows the user to analyze different forecast alternatives, to understand how they relate to the input parameters and identify consumption and production patterns. Initial assessment of the forecasting accuracy (MAPE 5.77%) on a limited dataset and the feedback from target users support the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 The Authors.",False
A cognitive knowledge-based model for an academic adaptive e-advising system,"Aim/Purpose This study describes a conceptual model, based on the principles of concept algebra that can provide intelligent academic advice using adaptive, knowledge-based feedback. The proposed model advises students based on their traits and academic history. The system aims to deliver adaptive advice to students using historical data from previous and current students. This data-driven approach utilizes a cognitive knowledge-based (CKB) model to update the weights (values that indicate the strength of relationships between concepts) that exist between student's performances and recommended courses. Background A research study conducted at the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET), a higher education institution in Kuwait, indicates that students' have positive perceptions of the e-Advising system. Most stu-dents believe that PAAET's e-Advising system is effective because it allows them to check their academic status, provides a clear vision of their academic timeline, and is a convenient, user-friendly, and attractive online service. Stu-dent advising can be a tedious element of academic life but is necessary to fill the gap between student performance and degree requirements. Higher edu-cation institutions have prioritized assisting undecided students with career decisions for decades. An important feature of e-Advising systems is person-alized feedback, where tailored advice is provided based on students' charac-teristics and other external parameters. Previous e-Advising systems provide students with advice without taking into consideration their different attrib-utes and goals. Methodology This research describes a model for an e-Advising system that enables stu-dents to select courses recommended based on their personalities and aca-demic performance. Three algorithms are used to provide students with adaptive course selection advice: The knowledge elicitation algorithm that rep-resents students' personalities and academic information, the knowledge bonding algorithm that combines related concepts or ideas within the knowledge base, and the adaptive e-Advising model that recommends rele-vant courses. The knowledge elicitation algorithm acquires student and aca-demic characteristics from data provided, while the knowledge bonding algo-rithm fuses the newly acquired features with existing information in the data-base. The adaptive e-Advising algorithm provides recommended courses to students based on existing cognitive knowledge to overcome the issues asso-ciated with traditional knowledge representation methods. Contribution The design and implementation of an adaptive e-Advising system are chal-lenging because it relies on both academic and student traits. A model that incorporates the conceptual interaction between the various academic and student-specific components is needed to manage these challenges. While other e-Advising systems provide students with general advice, these earlier models are too rudimentary to take student characteristics (e.g., knowledge level, learning style, performance, demographics) into consideration. For the online systems that have replaced face-to-face academic advising to be effec-tive, they need to take into consideration the dynamic nature of contempo-rary students and academic settings. Findings The proposed algorithms can accommodate a highly diverse student body by providing information tailored to each student. The academic and student el-ements are represented as an Object-Attribute-Relationship (OAR) model. Recommendations for Practitioners The model proposed here provides insight into the potential relationships be-tween students' characteristics and their academic standing. Furthermore, this novel e-Advising system provides large quantities of data and a platform through which to query students, which should enable developing more ef-fective, knowledge-based approaches to academic advising. Recommendation for Researchers The proposed model provides researches with a framework to incorporate various academic and student characteristics to determine the optimal advi-sory factors that affect a student's performance. Impact on Society The proposed model will benefit e-Advising system developers in imple-menting updateable algorithms that can be tested and improved to provide adaptive advice to students. The proposed approach can provide new insight to advisors on possible relationships between student's characteristics and current academic settings. Thus, providing a means to develop new curricu-lums and approaches to learning. Future Research In future studies, the proposed algorithms will be implemented, and the adaptive e-Advising model will be tested on real-world data and then further improved to cater to specific academic settings.

ABET Accreditation during and after COVID19 - Navigating the Digital Age,"Engineering accreditation agencies and governmental educational bodies worldwide require programs to evaluate specific learning outcomes information for attainment of student learning and establish accountability. Ranking and accreditation have resulted in programs adopting shortcut approaches to collate cohort information with minimally acceptable rigor for Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). With tens of thousands of engineering programs seeking accreditation, qualifying program evaluations that are based on reliable and accurate cohort outcomes is becoming increasingly complex and is high stakes. Manual data collection processes and vague performance criteria assimilate inaccurate or insufficient learning outcomes information that cannot be used for effective CQI. Additionally, due to the COVID19 global pandemic, many accreditation bodies have cancelled onsite visits and either deferred or announced virtual audit visits for upcoming accreditation cycles. In this study, we examine a novel meta-framework to qualify state of the art digital Integrated Quality Management Systems for three engineering programs seeking accreditation. The digital quality systems utilize authentic OBE frameworks and assessment methodology to automate collection, evaluation and reporting of precision CQI data.

"A pharmacist-led, patient-centered program incorporating motivational interviewing for behavior change to improve adherence rates and star ratings in a Medicare plan","INTRODUCTION: The Medicare 5-star quality rating system was designed to drive improvements in Medicare quality and to increase accountability among Medicare plans. Medicare star ratings provide significant bonuses for plans that improve medication adherence. Envolve’s pharmacy division, Envolve Pharmacy Solutions, which provides services for Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans, developed an in-house medication therapy management (MTM) program to improve adherence rates and subsequent star ratings. As part of this program, Envolve invested in motivational interviewing (MI) as a means to improve adherence to antihypertensives, antihyperlipidemics, and antidiabetics but recognized the need for additional staff training to ensure pharmacist success with MI techniques. Thus, Envolve engaged a consultant to help train pharmacists and evaluate the program. This best practices article describes the implementation of an MI program and subsequent changes in patient adherence and star ratings. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: A pharmacist-led, patient-centered adherence program incorporating MI for behavior change was developed and implemented at Envolve. The program used didactic learning, coaching and skills assessments, and a train-the-trainer (TtT) intervention. This approach resulted in improved adherence rates in all 3 therapeutic classes immediately. In addition, a quality improvement process was incorporated to evaluate the improvements in adherence with this new program over 24 months. OBSERVATIONS: Key findings of the program are as follows: (a) the program increased adherence rates 5-9 percentage points (chi-square tests for all plans and drug classes measured, P<0.05) over 5 years and improved Medicare star ratings by 1-2 stars; (b) there is a need for support of pharmacy MTM managers to ensure continued success of the program; and (c) there is value in a TtT program for managers that allows them to provide continuous evaluation and feedback to staff for improvement. IMPLICATIONS: Each year, as the Medicare star ratings system matures and plans are held more accountable for improving adherence measures, high star ratings become more difficult to attain. This MI TtT program for pharmacists allows for rapid cycle change in response to these challenges. Copyright © 2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

Design and Evaluation of a Block-based Environment with a Data Science Context,"As computing becomes pervasive across fields, introductory computing curricula needs new tools to motivate and educate the influx of learners with little prior background and divergent goals. We seek to improve curricula by enriching it with authentic, real-world contexts and powerful scaffolds that can guide learners to success using automated tools, thereby reducing the strain on limited human instructional resources. To address these issues, we have created the BlockPy programming environment, a web-based, open-access, open-source platform for introductory computing students (https://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy has an embedded data science context that allows learners to connect the educational content with real-world scenarios through meaningful problems. The environment is block-based and gives guiding feedback to learners as they complete problems, but also mediates transfer to more sophisticated programming environments by supporting bidirectional, seamless transitions between block and text programming. Although it can be used as a stand-alone application, the environment has first-class support for the latest Learning Tools Interoperability standards, so that instructors can embed the environment directly within their Learning Management System.

Turning Real-Time Analytics into Adaptive Scaffolds for Self-Regulated Learning Using Generative Artificial Intelligence,"In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL.

Artificial Intelligence Meets Kinesthetic Intelligence: Mouse-based User Authentication based on Hybrid Human-Machine Learning,"Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach.

This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated/human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years.

Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.",False

In this paper, the authors describe a pedagogical approach toward educating AI users from a range of STEM disciplines so that they can best exploit what AI has to offer. Specifically, a balanced approach is taken to ensure that learners gain knowledge and skills in what AI can or cannot do for them. A growing suite of experiential learning modules, which complement existing educational resources, serve as a vehicle for getting STEM learners ready for a future workplace characterized by significant use of AI technologies. These learning modules promote active learning and can be applied in a traditional classroom setting, self-directed online study, or a mix of the two modes. The paper ends with a presentation of encouraging results of actual use of the experiential learning modules in a mixed mode setting across multiple quantitative disciplines.

GenAI in the Context of African Universities: A Crisis of Tertiary Education or Its New Dawn?,"The rapid progression of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has raised significant interest and concern in academia. Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.",UNKNOWN,"Zlotnikova, Irina and Hlomani, Hlomani",10.1145/3689215,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,Digit.

StyleWe: Towards Style Fusion in Generative Fashion Design with Efficient Federated AI,"Collaboration can amalgamate diverse ideas, styles, and visual elements, fostering creativity and innovation among different designers. In collaborative design, sketches play a pivotal role as a means of expressing design creativity. However, designers often tend to not openly share these meticulously crafted sketches. This phenomenon of data island in the design area hinders its digital transformation under the third wave of AI. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Generative Artificial Intelligence Clothing system, namely StyleWe, employing federated learning to aid in sketch design. StyleWe is committed to establishing an ecosystem wherein designers can exchange sketch styles among themselves. Through StyleWe, designers can generate sketches that incorporate various designers' styles from their peers, drawing inspiration from collaboration without the need for data disclosure or upload. Extensive performance evaluations and user studies indicate that our StyleWe system can produce multi-styled sketches of comparable quality to human-designed ones while significantly enhancing efficiency compared to hand-drawn sketches.",UNKNOWN,"Wu, Di and Wu, Mingzhu and Li, Yeye and Jiang, Jianan and Li, Xinglin and Deng, Hanhui and Liu, Can and Li, Yi",10.1145/3687054,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,Proc.

L@S '24: Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,"It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented development of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the teaching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning for the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and informal contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rapid advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges for the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show potential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences and outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empirical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topics (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that examine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instructional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventions at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on student learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome studies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholders' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interactions with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using generative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at scale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support learning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, tangible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of existing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Research that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from underrepresented groups.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,9798400706332,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,2024,True,True,False,True,"It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education.
