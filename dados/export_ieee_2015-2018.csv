The act of acquiring knowledge is learning and with the advent of technology, learning has become easier. E-Learning is a popular learning method which uses the web or other technologies to promote learning. A very traditional learning method is discussed and some new methods with the integration of modern technology have been discussed. Although technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, ontology, fuzzy logic etc. have been used in learning systems they are still less automated, not personalized and do not pose the capability to self-learn. A method is proposed to increase the automation and self-learning in the e-learning management systems. Further, the personalization of learning for the user so that every type of learner can learn from the type and level of the content the learner seems fit is the main aim. The proposed system is feasible, economical and scalable which makes it suitable for every level.","","978-1-5386-1147-0","10.1109/ICETCCT.2017.8280344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280344","Machine learning;e-learning system;reinforcement learning;learning management system","Learning management systems;Electronic learning;Videos;Crawlers;Semantics;Task analysis","","4","","12","IEEE","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the success of network virtualisation will depend in part on how efficiently the virtual networks utilise substrate network resources. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to virtual network resource management. We propose to model the substrate network as a decentralised system and introduce a learning algorithm in each substrate node and substrate link, providing self-organization capabilities. We propose a multiagent learning algorithm that carries out the substrate network resource management in a coordinated and decentralised way. The task of these agents is to use evaluative feedback to learn an optimal policy so as to dynamically allocate network resources to virtual nodes and links. The agents ensure that while the virtual networks have the resources they need at any given time, only the required resources are reserved for this purpose. Simulations show that our dynamic approach significantly improves the virtual network acceptance ratio and the maximum number of accepted virtual network requests at any time while ensuring that virtual network quality of service requirements such as packet drop rate and virtual link delay are not affected.","2374-9709","978-1-4799-0913-1","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838258","Network virtualization;Dynamic Resource Allocation;Virtual Network Embedding;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Multiagent Systems","Substrates;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling;Delays;Learning (artificial intelligence);Bandwidth;Heuristic algorithms","","74","","27","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By this way, design organization assures aircraft development life cycle by complying with aviation regulations. To meet requirements of Design Organization Approval, Design Organization transfers its authority and technical signatories to its subcontractors to improve effectiveness of the system. So, performance of design subcontractors shall be traceable and measurable to match capability requirements of main contractor. Thus, subcontractor evaluation is a long and complicated process; survey implementation could be misleading in some cases. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel tool to measure performance of a design subcontractor according to necessities of Design Assurance System. Up to now, there is no tool to evaluate aviation design subcontractors. With this tool, contractor firm can evaluate multiple criteria in a single run. AHP is used to prioritize criteria relative to each other one-by-one.

To tackle this problem, this paper introduces a collaborative model based context awareness multi-modal traffic management aiming at providing an efficient way to manage the traffic inside a transportation station. In this model (Multi-Layers Stations: the stations that have different intersections for different means of transport), the traffic management is based on a Q-learning technique that takes into account the context awareness parameters to provide more potent decisions. The learning technique offers the opportunity to the system (transportation station) to adapt dynamically its decision (choice of the best transportation mean) based on feedbacks provided by the passengers traveling from that specified station and thus optimize their journey through the transportation network. The efficacy of our proposed technique is validated through extensive simulations for different layers of transport means like metros, trains, and buses.

An interview coaching system tries to simulate an interviewer to provide mock interview practice simulation sessions for the users. The traditional interview coaching systems provide some feedbacks, including facial preference, head nodding, response time, speaking rate, and volume, to let users know their own performance in the mock interview. But most of these systems are trained with insufficient dialog data and provide the pre-designed interview questions. In this study, we propose an approach to dialog state tracking and action selection based on deep learning methods. First, the interview corpus in this study is collected from 12 participants, and is annotated with dialog states and actions. Next, a long-short term memory and an artificial neural network are employed to predict dialog states and the Deep RL is adopted to learn the relation between dialog states and actions. Finally, the selected action is used to generate the interview question for interview practice. To evaluate the proposed method in action selection, an interview coaching system is constructed. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for dialog state tracking and action selection.","","978-1-5090-0922-0","10.1109/IALP.2016.7875922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875922","interview coaching system;deep reinforcement learning;LSTM","Interviews;Training;Semantics;Neural networks;Learning (artificial intelligence);Data visualization;Predictive models","","3","","22","IEEE","13 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergent and self-organizing behaviours seen in many such distributed systems are closely congruent to the phenomenon of collective intelligence. Emergence and self-organization often occur together and appear to be subsumed within a broader framework of collective intelligence in distributed systems. Collective intelligence, the ability of a group to exhibit greater intelligence than its individual members, is result of various distributed interaction mechanisms, which are quite similar to the so-far identified mechanisms and underlying structures of emergence and self-organization. This paper presents a short analytical survey of the concepts and characteristic properties of emergence, self-organization and collective intelligence and tries to establish the strong similarity and inter-relatedness in them. The complex non-linear dynamics found in systems exhibiting these properties is not reducible to individual parts and therefore require a generative modeling approach of analysis. The Agent-based modeling and simulation approach seems the most suitable choice, as is also demonstrated through an example of agent-based simulation of obstacle handling in a collective setting.","","978-0-7695-4994-1","10.1109/UKSim.2013.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6527413","Emergergence;Self-organization;Collective Intelligence;Agent-based Modeling;Social Simulation","Organizations;Emergent phenomena;Artificial intelligence;Computational modeling;Multi-agent systems;Observers;Computers","","5","","45","IEEE","10 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present our findings on how affective feedback can be used to drive reinforcement learning in human-robot interactions (HRI) and other dialogue systems. We implemented a system where a humanoid robot, named ZOEI, acts as a standup comedian by entertaining a human audience in a bid to generate humor and positively influence the emotional state of the humans. The mood rating of the audience is recorded prior to the interaction session. Using a survey, the eventual emotional state of the human participant is captured after the HRI session. For each audience member, we capture feedback regarding how funny each joke was. We present the implementation of the content selection framework. We share our findings to substantiate the idea that by using expressive behaviors of the humanoid to influence the delivery of content (in this case, jokes) as well as employing reinforcement learning techniques for driving targeted content selection, the robot was able to improve the human mood score progressively across the 16 people who engaged in the study.","1944-9437","978-1-4799-6765-0","10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926289","HRI;Affective Content;Affective Computing;Humanoids;Affect Generation;Ubiquitous Computing;Collective Intelligence;Internet of Things","Humanoid robots;Learning (artificial intelligence);Senior citizens;Robot sensing systems;Emotion recognition","","10","1","22","IEEE","20 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The instant reactivity of this 3D site allows immediate appropriation by the students and teachers, and so, builds a users' community. The connected people can support the other ones and share their knowledge. The ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System), built with artificial intelligence principles, will supply additional help to learners and teachers. The client-server architecture of GE3D is standard, cost-effective and adapted to the needs and equipment of developing countries.

Based on these predictions, a proactive resource allocation scheme is applied that assigns only the required resources to virtual machines to keep their cost to a minimum.

They are both regarded as promising methods involving important components of evaluation and improvement, at the background of information technology, such as artificial intelligence, big data, and deep learning. Although great progresses have been achieved and surveyed when addressing nonlinear optimal control problems, the research on robustness of ADP-based control strategies under uncertain environment has not been fully summarized. Hence, this survey reviews the recent main results of adaptive-critic-based robust control design of continuous-time nonlinear systems. The ADP-based nonlinear optimal regulation is reviewed, followed by robust stabilization of nonlinear systems with matched uncertainties, guaranteed cost control design of unmatched plants, and decentralized stabilization of interconnected systems.

Restaurants give considerable attention to customers’ feedback about their service, since the reputation of the business depends on it. Key factors of evaluating customer satisfaction are, being able to deliver the services effectively to lessen the time of consumption, as well as maintaining a high quality of service. In most cases of selecting a prominent restaurant, customers focus on their choice of favorite food in addition to available seating and space options. Long waiting times and serving the wrong order is a common mistake that happens in every restaurant that eventually leads to customer dissatisfaction. Objectives of this online application “Foody” is to address these deficiencies and provide efficient and accurate services to the customer, by providing unique menus to each customer considering their taste. This concept is implemented as a mobile application using latest IT concepts such as Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Predictive Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. This includes graphics and 3D modeling that provide existent physical information related to food such as colors, sizes and further user can view the ingredients of the meal as well as the available tables. In addition, the app shows the real-time map to the restaurant. Current table reservation status is indicated by the color change of the table. Unique food recommendation and it’s order for each customer is generated by analyzing their social media information and the system notifies the customer the wait time by calculating it. Preparation of food and allocation is done subjectively. The expected outcome of the research is to develop a fully automated restaurant management system with the mentioned features as well as to avoid confusions between orders, provide better view of food and allow the customer to choose the menu according to their taste in a minimum time.","2572-7621","978-1-5386-5051-6","10.1109/R10-HTC.2018.8629835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629835","Restaurant Management;Handling Reservations;Machine Learning;3D Menu;Food Recommendation;Data Retrieving;Tasks Allocate;Business Intelligence;Genetic Algorithm;Sentiment Analysis;Unique menu","Mobile applications;Smart phones;Three-dimensional displays;Databases;Robot sensing systems;Natural language processing;Color","","17","","26","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Theories of individual and organizational learning from irregular events - exceptions, interruptions, surprises, accidents, and so on - tend to conform to one of two contradictory patterns. I draw these theories together to understand the complementary processes by which learners derive knowledge and insight from irregular events. I identify contingency factors that bias learners toward one of the two cognitive modes - incorporation of multiple events into a generalized understanding, or expansion of individual events into rich analytical conversations - and propose ""exception design"" levers by which BPM dashboard implementers can adjust these factors and influence the way users create knowledge in business intelligence. A pilot experiment lends some support to the hypothesis that frequency and ambivalence are designable aspects of exceptions that affect learning.

This paper discusses a pedagogically designed online system that employs a set of purposely devised techniques based on a reflexive ideology, whereby complex reasoning skills such as critical and creative thinking form part of the process. Additionally, peer- and self-reviewing together with feedback upon feedback enables scalable assessment of complex critical thinking assignments.

Gauging population sentiment for targeted response areas and having the ability to predict or control sentiment within these areas is invaluable. Review of reception towards deployed forces must be analyzed, especially in areas vital for U.S. national interests. Predicting population behavior is critical for success and must include a qualitative as well as a quantitative solution. Additionally, a feedback mechanism is needed for periodically updating reception towards presence of U.S. Forces over time. We propose a method for predicting sentiment towards deployed U.S. Forces in near real time, to efficiently propitiate manpower resources, allocate equipment assets, and reduce cost of analyses. Sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly important and feasible task based on social media, open source data, physical imagery and abundance of video data feeds. Predicting reaction to events can be time consuming. Locating the most likely affected areas is very tedious, requiring much human labor effort, and it is often difficult to obtain the best information on a timely basis. An efficient tool would be helpful to rapidly parse text that has been extracted from an intelligent algorithm in order to evaluate the population sentiment for the targeted area. Multiple data inputs and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are required in order to support sound decision making theory.

A variety of relevance feedback schemes have been designed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts for an image retrieval task. Various collaborative image retrieval (CIR) schemes aim to utilize the user historical feedback log data with similar and dissimilar pairwise constraints to improve the performance of a CBIR system. However, existing subspace learning approaches with explicit label information cannot be applied for a CIR task although the subspace learning techniques play a key role in various computer vision tasks, e.g., face recognition and image classification. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning framework, i.e., conjunctive patches subspace learning (CPSL) with side information, for learning an effective semantic subspace by exploiting the user historical feedback log data for a CIR task. CPSL can effectively integrate the discriminative information of labeled log images, the geometrical information of labeled log images, and the weakly similar information of unlabeled images together to learn a reliable subspace. We formulate this problem into a constrained optimization problem and then present a new subspace learning technique to exploit the user historical feedback log data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real-world image database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving the performance of a CBIR system by exploiting the user historical feedback log data.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2195014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185675","Collaborative image retrieval (CIR);log data;side information;subspace learning","Semantics;Measurement;Radio frequency;Image retrieval;Visualization;Geometry;Manifolds","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiology Information Systems;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","58","","53","IEEE","17 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, dynamic spectrum access (DSA), which focuses on the management and distribution of the resources, is a critical problem, especially when only limited resources are available. Currently, this problem is handled by the game theory and auction theory, since this is a problem involving multiple agents. In this paper, we propose agent-based modeling method to model this multi-agent environment and probabilistic reinforcement learning to learn the optimal strategies. We focus on a simple scenario with only one primary user (PU) and multiple secondary users (SUs), and try to maximize the revenues of both sides, which may be further extended to other scenarios with different number of agents. First, we model this environment as a monopolistic market from the perspective of economics, where a PU acts as the monopoly and the SUs are passive buyers. Then, we propose probabilistic reinforcement learning methods to handle DSA so that both the PU and SUs can behave optimally by learning from the feedback of the others.

In addition, due to the high degree of uncertainty for speech recognition, retrieval results can be very noisy. One way to counter such difficulties is through user-machine interaction. The machine can take different actions to interact with the user to obtain better retrieval results before showing them to the user. For example, the machine can request extra information from the user, return a list of topics for the user to select from, and so on. In this paper, we propose using deep-Q-network (DQN) to determine the machine actions for interactive spoken content retrieval. DQN bypasses the need to estimate hand-crafted states, and directly determines the best action based on the present retrieval results even without any human knowledge.

The policy iteration algorithm is employed to conduct the learning process and a critic neural network is built, serving as the approximator, to implement the algorithm conveniently. The main idea comes from adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), which is regarded as a self-learning optimal control approach with a certain degree of human brain intelligence.

Most of existing AMC methods select the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) using pre-computed mappings between MCS indexes and channel quality indicator (CQI) feedbacks that are periodically sent by the receivers. However, the effectiveness of this approach heavily depends on the assumed channel model. In addition CQI feedback delays may cause throughput losses. In this paper we design a new AMC scheme that exploits a reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust at run-time the MCS selection rules based on the knowledge of the effect of previous AMC decisions. The salient features of our proposed solution are: i) the low-dimensional space that the learner has to explore, and ii) the use of direct link throughput measurements to guide the decision process. Simulation results obtained using ns3 demonstrate the robustness of our AMC scheme that is capable of discovering the best MCS even if the CQI feedback provides a poor prediction of the channel performance.","1090-3038","978-1-4799-4449-1","10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6966162","","Throughput;Long Term Evolution;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Learning (artificial intelligence);Indexes;Modulation","","24","1","25","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When vehicles are associated with the heterogeneous base stations (e.g., macrocells, picocells, and femtocells), one of the most important problems is to make load balancing among these base stations. Different from common mobile networks, data traffic in vehicular networks can be observed having regularities in the spatial-temporal dimension due to the periodicity of urban traffic flow. By taking advantage of this feature, we propose an online reinforcement learning approach, called ORLA. It is a distributed user association algorithm for network load balancing in vehicular networks. Based on the historical association experiences, ORLA can obtain a good association solution through learning from the dynamic vehicular environment continually. In the long run, the real-time feedback and the regular traffic association patterns both help ORLA cope with the dynamics of network well. In experiments, we use QiangSheng taxi movement to evaluate the performance of ORLA. Our experiments verify that ORLA has higher quality load balancing compared with other popular association methods.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2709462","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602110); Sailing Program(grant numbers:16YF1400200); Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project(grant numbers:16511100900); National Science Foundation for Postdoctoral Scientists of China(grant numbers:2016M591575); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571331); Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:151066); Shuguang Program from Shanghai Education Development Foundation(grant numbers:14SG20); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2232016D-30); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950979","User association;online reinforcement learning;load balancing;vehicular networks","Learning (artificial intelligence);Load management;Vehicle dynamics;Femtocells;Macrocell networks","","89","","27","IEEE","16 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Processes of: design, development and implementation of interactive educational modules are presented, for the topic “materials and textile products chemical finishing operations” of chemical textile technology. Textile finishing can be subdivided into two distinctly different areas, chemical finishing and mechanical finishing. Chemical finishing or `wet finishing' involves the addition of chemicals to textiles to achieve a desired result. Physical properties such as dimensional stability and chemical properties such as flame retardancy can both be improved with chemical finishing. Typically, the appearance of the textile is unchanged after chemical finishing. Elearning modules provide student with information examples containing: rich multimedia elements, text, glossary, webography, bibliography, and knowledge and skills assimilation assessment. The modules are divided into a number of teaching and learning units which can be studied autonomously (or independent). Chemical Technological Discipline model is a new approach to learning chemistry-one that presents concepts in the customary logically developed order but illustrates them with exemplars that reflect the applications students are interested in. Chemical Technological Discipline resources are especially for secondary school teachers and students, with topics ranging from introductory to advanced Textiles Chemistry. Teachers will find reliable and quality resources including videos, articles, demonstrations, worksheets, assessments and activities all in one location. Resources are searchable by topic and standards. eLearning Modules are using visualization of chemistry concepts. These principles focus on a few chemistry-specific pedagogical pointers: 1. providing multiple representations and descriptions, 2. making linked referential connections visible, 3. presenting the dynamic and interactive nature of chemistry, 4. promoting the transformation between 2D and 3D, and 5. reducing cognitive load by making information explicit and integrating information for students.","","978-1-4799-0153-1","10.1109/ICL.2013.6644529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644529","elearning instruction materials;technical undergraduate's schools;doctoral research;moodle","Chemicals;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Textiles","","1","","17","IEEE","24 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to learn collectively and speed-up the process, the robots share with each other a selection of the locally acquired gesture data. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed cooperative learning approach is effective and robust, in spite of its simplicity.

However, since a large amount of training data for a specific product domain is not always available, transfer learning is often utilized to do sentiment analysis applications. Specifically, after a pre-training of the large Chinese corpus by a word-embedding method, a larger size of training data for a specific domain was trained using a Gated Recurrent Unit. And then the trained model was used for testing the sentiment classification for a smaller amount of product reviews. The performances of this transfer learning method was also examined, especially to testify different factors affecting the performance of the transfer learning. The experimental results showed that different wording in the review domain (which we call it “noise”) will have a greater impact on transfer learning. We also calculate the difference of the wording to verify our hypothesis. According to these results, we have explored the impacts of the dataset wording, while we are doing Chinese text sentiment classification.

This paper introduces Hipster, a technique that combines heuristics and reinforcement learning to manage latency-critical workloads. Hipster's goal is to improve resource efficiency in data centers while respecting the QoS of the latency-critical workloads. Hipster achieves its goal by exploring heterogeneous multi-cores and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). To improve data center utilization and make best usage of the available resources, Hipster can dynamically assign remaining cores to batch workloads without violating the QoS constraints for the latency-critical workloads. We perform experiments using a 64-bit ARM big.LITTLE platform, and show that, compared to prior work, Hipster improves the QoS guarantee for Web-Search from 80% to 96%, and for Memcached from 92% to 99%, while reducing the energy consumption by up to 18%.","2378-203X","978-1-5090-4985-1","10.1109/HPCA.2017.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7920843","","Quality of service;Power demand;Energy consumption;Servers;Learning (artificial intelligence);Resource management;Throughput","","51","","62","IEEE","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Embodied pedagogical agents are particularly useful in teaching young learners because of the engagement, and enjoyment they engender. Teaching robots are among possibilities in the future classroom; they may also represent solutions to the looming, acute global teacher scarcity. However, their design creates unique computational challenges. Moreover, robot-human systems involving a single robot in interaction with multiple humans, are not common. PI has been reported in many studies as a learner-centered approach that supports conceptual learning, metacognition, cognitive load sharing, and higher order learning, through peer scaffolding. However, existing studies have reported only applications by human teachers in regular classrooms. This study highlights an approach for enabling a PERT as a PI facilitator. Based on conflicting reports of the significance of agent embodiment for learning, we present the report of two experimental studies from our assessment of the system, employing the mixed method approach. We compared participants' perception of the robot's social presence and teaching quality when the robot is physically present and when it is absent (voice-only). Our findings are based on data from 14 participants in each study. The Social Presence indeX (SPiX) and the teacher quality index (TQI) were used for quantitative data collection for social presence and teaching quality, respectively. Qualitative data were based on live observation and participants' open-ended feedback. Quantitative findings show no significant difference in participants' perceptions in both conditions but qualitative feedback provided more information. Our findings show: i) students are willing to accept non-human teachers, and ii) their expectations of them are similar to those for human teachers; iii) an improved affective system will promote increased presence; iv) participants noted the robot as `neutral', with important implications for culturally-responsive education; v) robot teachers could be potential technology-inspired solution to global teacher scarcity and vi) in addition to promoting deeper learning, PI can be a useful pedagogical approach for non-human teachers. This study is in line with anticipated ability of future technological advancements to support machines that are as effective as intelligent human tutors.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658445","robot teacher;embodiment;pedagogical agents;PAs;peer instruction;social presence;teaching quality","Education;Robot kinematics;Collaboration;Robot sensing systems;Indexes;Artificial intelligence","","6","","49","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigate this problem under two different frameworks: i) an optimization approach where the energy beacon knows the utility function of the nodes, channel state information and the energy harvesting characteristics of the devices; hence optimal power allocation strategies can be designed using an optimization problem and ii) a learning approach where the energy beacon decides on its strategies adaptively with battery level information and feedback on the utility function.

We first present a model-based planning method in which it is necessary to train the state transition probabilities and the expected time intervals between adjacent decision epochs. To facilitate training them, the SMDP is degraded into a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) in which the service requests and ongoing service completions follow a continuous-time Markov chain. The relative value iterative algorithm for the CTMDP is used to find an asymptotically optimal VM allocation policy. In addition, we also propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method, where an optimal coordinated VM allocation policy is approximated by learning from the states and rewards of feedback. The simulation results show that the performance of the model-free RL method can converge to a level similar to that of the model-based planning method and outperform the greedy VM allocation method.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2818680","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61728108,61571375); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331089","Cloud-fog computing systems;model-based planning;model-free reinforcement learning (RL);semi-Markov decision process (SMDP);virtual machine (VM) allocation","Cloud computing;Resource management;Computational modeling;Learning (artificial intelligence);Planning;Internet of Things;Heuristic algorithms","","60","","41","IEEE","4 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The agent’s learning is based on rewards, and feedback signals proportional to how good its actions are. The simulation platform used was infrastructure interdependencies simulator, in which, we have tested suitability of the approach in previous studies. In this paper, we have added new features to our previous solution, for enabling faster convergence and distributed processing. These additions include an enhanced reward scheme and a scheduler for orchestrating the distributed training. We include two test cases. The first case is a compact model with four critical infrastructures. In this model, the agent’s training required only 10% of the attempts needed in our previous version. Improvements in convergence come from adding a shaping reward scheme. We trained the agent across 24 simultaneous configurations of our model. The training process elapsed 4 min. The extended case included more infrastructures and a higher level of detail. The dimensionality of the problem grew by a factor of 4000, but the training converged in less episodes. We tested the extended model over 96 parallel instances (potential scenarios) with completion in 2.87 min. The results show a fast and stable convergence.

However, this method can only handle a special vehicle whose dynamic parameters are well known. In this paper, we use transfer learning technique to further extend this direct trajectory planning method and master general parking skills. We aim to mimic how human drivers make parking by using a specially designed deep neural network.

Often actions of situation control face hardly definable goal situations and lack of control optimality.

Despite the increased adoption of LMS in the region, their potential has not been fully exploited as relatively few users tend to use them, thereby not justifying the high infrastructure investment costs. The continued penetration and adoption of mobile phones amongst users in the region presents an opportunity to find ways of making LMS accessible to users via mobile phones. However, there are relatively few attempts to enhance accessibility and usage of LMS into users' mobile phones especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This article aims at sharing experiences of configuring and using Mobile Moodle to enhance Moodle LMS usage and accessibility via mobile phones at the University of Dar es Salaam. Through analyzing log of two selected courses, it was revealed that the majority of students used Course View and User List features to read course notes and to check for their fellow students respectively. In addition, students indicated that the Mobile Moodle was easy to use and enable them to accomplish learning activities more quickly through a questionnaire that was distributed to elicit their opinions about the Mobile Moodle.

Learning Management Systems (LMS) have emerged from an auxiliary role to a critical one in higher education. In short, ICT development, telecommunication infrastructures and Internet have a strong impact in the education sector especially with the advent of distance learning that is becoming more important. More and more academic institutions are moving to eLearning today and Moodle is one of the most popular LMS with several currently active sites. However, in Moodle, learners must be connected online all time they need to do eLearning activities. Moreover, the introduction of distance learning in developing countries is done with a set of constraints such as connection costs, power cuts and permanent Internet connectivity failure in some areas. This paper presents an enhanced solution for running Moodle in offline mode to improve asynchronous learning. This solution allows learners to continue eLearning activities in cases where Internet connection is highly disturbed or not existed. The presented solution uses transparent and automatic configuration for end user's PC or laptop. After the connection is restored, all offline activities will be synchronized to the principal Moodle platform.

Moodle is an open source learning management system. One of its features is to generate a quiz consisting random questions which is chosen form question bank. If the quiz is created randomly, it can't accommodate specific constraints. Genetic algorithm provides an opportunity to generate quiz which approximate the constraints. Our research follows previous researches done by Xiaoqin & Yin (2009) and Huang & Wang (2008), modifies them to be applied in the development of Moodle quiz generation plugins. Several attributes which are selected from previous researches, are augmented to the each question in question bank. The generated quiz is also augmented by corresponding attributes. Quiz generator needs constraints as input. Genetic algorithm will generate a quiz whose attributes approximate the constraints. The generated quiz can be used in tests after this step. At the moment, there is no option of using genetic algorithm for quiz generation in Moodle. The plugins consist of one main quiz plugin and several question type plugins. The main quiz plugin was developed so that genetic algorithm can be used in quiz generation. Meanwhile, several question type plugins were developed to provide augmented questions which quiz plugin is going to use. These plugins have been successfully implemented and integrated to Moodle.","","978-1-5386-1449-5","10.1109/ICODSE.2017.8285882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285882","genetic algorithm;Moodle;plugins;quiz generation","Genetic algorithms;Biological cells;Mathematical model;Sociology;Statistics;Software engineering;Generators","","3","","19","IEEE","12 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the spread of this culture, there is a need for Learning management system as MOODLE, aTutor, canvas and Sakai. Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (MOODLE) allows students and instructors to interact easily and effectively in various ways, especially via private messaging system. In order to make this feature more convenient for both students and instructors, this research proposed a model that integrated within messaging system of MOODLE to filter unwanted messages, recommend a material for students, and to help them finding answers to their questions which are founded on the message. The problem of this research is how to build a model to prevent message which contains taboo words and send recommended material to students according to their questions. This new model will make it easier for students to find information and materials they are looking for, or asking about and at the same time it will keep instructors' mailbox clean of any unwanted irrelevant messages. The research methodology consists of four stages start from stating the theoretical foundation, then designing the model functions, building the model's functions, and finally evaluating the Model. The model was applied at University of Palestine on six courses with various natural of materials, some of these materials are isolated topics. In this type of courses the accuracy of the system was high. On the other hand, there are some courses in which their topics are integrated with each other, and the accuracy was less than the other type of materials, but in general the whole system's accuracy is 96.66% and the reliability of the system is 92.55%.

It is also important to assess the code content-wise, i.e. whether the code contains some or all the blocks that are specified in the assignment. For this purpose a novel method has been developed and implemented into the existing Moodle module.

It is a laborious work to track many students in the universities. So, the universities started using content management systems to track the record of the student's marks, grades and performance. Even then, the tutor have to evaluate manually to finalize the list of low grade students. As this is a problematic method, in this paper, the best method is explained for this purpose. There are many e-learning systems helping the institutions to evaluate their student's skills. In this paper, the comparison for those existing ones are made and the better one is selected i.e., Moodle. Being an open source software, providing the users flexibility in updating the tasks and excelling in its security it is opted to store VRSEC student's performance records. The further step is to analyze the students' performance and predict the grades. For this, Rapid miner an open source tool is used. Primarily the records of the VRSEC students are stored in the Moodle and are then extracted into Rapid miner environment. Certain parameters are defined to complete the pre-processing concept. Then classification algorithm is applied to predict the grades of the students. By applying various classification algorithms, it is observed that decision tree algorithm gave greatest accuracy of 85% and with weighted mean of recall and precision as 75.00% and 89.63% respectively.","","978-1-4799-8150-2","10.1109/ICCCT2.2014.7066695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066695","Virtual Learning Environment (VLE);Moodle;Data Mining tools - Rapid miner;Data mining classification algorithms- Naive Bayes;K-means;Expectation Maximization;K-Nearest Neighbors;Decision Tree","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Electronic learning;Learning systems;Support vector machines;Content management","","4","","15","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These micro-notes can be viewed by students while watching videos online (via the Moodle platform), or can be downloaded along with videos for offline viewing (where they appear as sub-titles to videos). An instructor can also play videos with micro-notes in a classroom (blended learning). In this case, the video automatically pauses each time a micro-note is encountered. This permits the instructor to blend their own content into the video, and give students the opportunity to dwell on this additional material.","","978-1-4673-9509-0","10.1109/T4E.2015.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395615","Micro-notes;Moodle;Blended learning;LMS","Videos;Conferences;Open source software;Learning management systems;YouTube;Internet","","","","10","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It also motivates project key stakeholders to regularly save significant tacit knowledge of unique situations in the form of lessons learnt during the project development. Various agents of the estimation system access the existing knowledge base and autonomously perform their inferencing activities using description logic as per requirements specified by the scrum master and respond with suitable estimate to him/her in the form of time, resources, and lessons learnt for the success of future projects. To validate our approach, an experiment, based on twelve web projects, was conducted using proposed approach, delphi and planning poker estimation methods. The obtained results by applying MMRE, PRED(x) evaluation measures reveals that proposed approach delivers more accurate estimates as compared with delphi and planning poker methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2771257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101453","Knowledge management;multiagent effort estimation system;ontology;Scrum","Software;Estimation;Ontologies;Scrum (Software development);Knowledge based systems;Companies;Semantics","","25","","30","OAPA","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is essential for scheduling, management and control of microgrid resources. So far, the existing STLF methodologies have been successfully used for the aggregated load forecasting in transmission and distribution systems. Nevertheless, their prediction accuracy in microgrid applications, where diversity is low and considerable changes in the load of customers can be observed in a short period of time, is not investigated. The random and chaotic nature of individual customers' loads make STLF challenging; hence, this paper aims to address the issues for the above methodologies in microgrids.","2474-1507","978-1-5386-8474-0","10.1109/AUPEC.2018.8757874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8757874","Artificial intelligence;classical load forecasting approaches;microgrids;short-term load forecasting","Decision feedback equalizers;Uplink;Optical transmitters;Light fidelity;Peak to average power ratio;Receivers;Feedforward systems","","4","","18","IEEE","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most higher institutions have applied Learning Management Systems (LMSs) to manage their online courses, with Moodle as one of the most favored LMS. However on the other side creating a well designed and written course remains problematic for teachers. That's why the community encourages them to share their courses for others to reuse. The authors or teachers then will continuously revise their courses, that will make subscribers to re-download the whole course again, which will soon lead to exhaustive network usage. To cope with this issue a synchronization model of course's backup file is proposed, retrieving the differential updates only. This paper proposed the synchronization of the existing backup and restore features. The file synchronization is performed between course's backup files based on rsync algorithm. The experiment was conducted on virtual machine, local network, and public network. The result showed lower network traffic compared to the conventional sharing method just like our previous synchronization method. However unlike the previous one this method had two other additional advantages which are the flexibility to control the synchronization content and compatibility to all versions of Moodle.","","978-1-5090-0931-2","10.1109/TENCONSpring.2016.7519372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519372","E-learning;Backup and Restore;Learning Management System;Moodle;Network Traffic;Online Course Synchronization;Rsync Algorithm","Synchronization;Electronic learning;Regions;Electronic mail;Internet;Computers","","1","","15","IEEE","25 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By using distance learning tools, the student education can be more flexible with respect to place and time constraints. So, students can access information in every time and everywhere either in libraries or during the lectures. As is widely known that, distance learning is costly, and cost-effectiveness becomes more important as the institutions become large-scale providers of distance education. Cost which is the most important disadvantages of distance learning according to traditional learning environments can be removed with the extensive features of the Open Source Software. Generalizing the usage of Open Source Software will provide development of learning tools and increases the educational quality. As far as the literature is reviewed, not much research has already been conducted about the comparisons of open source learning management systems in distance education.

In large classes (more than 1000 students), the lack of on-site teachers and classrooms to run several tutorial groups in parallel means that pedagogical activities of an academic year go on for more than 18 months. Integration of ICT in education can contribute significantly to solving the problem. We propose a technical solution that takes into account the narrowness of the bandwidth of Internet access (actually 2 Mbps). We strengthen the capacities of the NBU in IT resources and optimize their use. In this sense, we are making the intranet functional where Leaning Management System (LMS) servers can be accessed with a throughput of at least 10 Mbps from all university sites, including university residences. Optimal exploitation techniques of the Internet resource have been applied. We have conducted a thorough analysis of the causes of slow loading of pedagogical resources and learning activities and we propose technical solutions to alleviate the LMS Moodle. Thereby, on average, we managed to halve the loading time of this platform's resources.

It involves knowledge about the purpose of urban design, behaviors of users and needs in terms of mobility. We believe that in the near future, decision makers will have to react and more frequently adapt public policies, based on the huge amount of available data, feedbacks from both target users and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a generic agent-based architecture to model and simulate urban policies, which could facilitate the co-design and assessment of public policies in a specific environment. Two agent-based models are coupled with a micromacro dynamic loop, and they can be adapted either by the system using reinforcement learning, or by the stakeholders using simulation results. A generic formalism is elaborated to represent urban policies, which can be instantiated in a co-design approach between the policymaker and our system. An experimentation is conducted on an urban mobility policy, related to the configuration of parking price system in downtown area. The agent’s behavior and environment are developed to be as realistic as possible, based on a real-world source of modeling. However, our architecture has been designed to be generic, exploiting infrastructure data from any city using available community data (Open Street Map). The scenario of parking pricing shows that the system learns postpolicy behaviors and can propose some adjustments (e.g., specific actions to apply, when and how) to better meet the stakeholders’ objectives (e.g., maximize parking gains). The policy maker can then choose to validate the provided policies, or modified them for additional simulations.","2375-0197","978-1-5386-3876-7","10.1109/ICTAI.2017.00199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8372102","AgentBased Modeling;Agent Based Simulation;Multi Agent Systems;Policy Making;Public Policy;Reinforcement Learning;Urban Policy","Stakeholders;Public policy;Adaptation models;Urban areas;Sociology;Statistics;Tools","","","","15","IEEE","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring the day to day academic activities of a student in an Institute can be a challenging task in these modern times. The performance of a student can be analyzed by using statistics. Statistics plays an integral role when things are to be measured and compared with expected level of performance with the sole criteria of improving the performance. This paper attempts ways in which the academic performance of students can be improved; without the teacher (faculty) being burdened with additional responsibilities in the form of gathering data on various parameters of the student and then analyzing them. The system is an attempt of automating this task by involving all the stake holders in the form of students, parents, teachers and Institutional Heads so as to improve the social responsibilities of a student as an individual, to the society in general. This system uses ubiquitous computing with various wireless technologies so as to meet the above task. It uses a Learning Management System (LMS) [1] as a platform for implementation.

Whilst both staff and students are successful at completing given tasks in Moodle in our specialist User Lab, many staff were found to display extreme dissatisfaction with the experience. As Moodle use is a one to many relationship, where relatively small numbers of staff operate Moodle for the benefit of scores of students, and as many of the problems observed relate to staff, this impacts on the whole learning experience and environment. Patchy use of Moodle by staff can lead to a student experience that may vary considerably depending on the member of staff teaching them and how well they have integrated the use of Moodle within their course delivery.

Although nowadays there exist many examples how to build them it is still advantageous to create new solutions that are universal, more flexible and comfortable to use. This paper describes the design of a new application developed for the purpose of virtual laboratories. It is based on the Microsoft .NET technology and Matlab/Simulink platform. In comparison with older versions the new one uses new progressive methods of .NET technology and REST architecture for communication. This allows simplification of its construction, easy modification according to new requirements as well as a simple creation of client applications. Moreover the designed application is integrated with Moodle e-learning system environment that enables comfortable access for its registered users. The new virtual laboratory application facilities will be demonstrated on several dynamical systems. The architecture of the designed solution consists of three main components: server, Moodle and browser (Fig. 1). The server includes Matlab COM Automation server that enables to run the Matlab application and exchange data with it using COM technology. Further the server communicates with Moodle using ASP.NET Web API framework. The server is written in C# programming language. Moodle (in the role of a client) communicates with the server using GET and POST methods and it also communicates with a browser as a backend using JSON objects. Moodle uses PHP scripts to generate dynamical Web pages. Finally the browser interprets the Web pages consisting of HTML code and asynchronous JavaSript language with JQuery library. The resulting Web application for the virtual laboratory provides users with description of dynamical models, displaying corresponding block diagrams, setting parameters, performing simulations, displaying numerical results, showing graphs, animations and video of dynamical systems responses.","","978-1-4673-8534-3","10.1109/ICETA.2015.7558497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558497","","Servers;MATLAB;Browsers;Web pages;Numerical models;Automotive engineering;Mechatronics","","1","","1","IEEE","5 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Courses disseminated are either fully online or on a blended learning mode. While the growth rate of online learning is higher compared to the traditional mode, we also find that online learners lack the pedagogical support to help them pursue successfully their studies online. With a growing feeling of isolation due to lack of interaction online, they end up withdrawing from the course. Whereby the necessity to develop an online learning environment to meet the pedagogical needs of students. In support to higher education institutions, learning management systems (LMS) provide the core learning platforms for an online environment. However to assess how effective an online learning environment is, universities need to measure how well these LMS deliver their key functions and fulfill the pedagogical needs of learners online. This paper explores initially the perceptions of learners following the use of Moodle as well as the barriers they face. This exploratory study was conducted through a web survey to learners engaged in blended learning. Once the data was collected and analyzed, with the use of the Community of Inquiry Framework, which is considered as the model which provides insights to the dimensions of an effective online learning environment, we explored how effective the main functionalities and tools available on Moodle provided the pedagogical supports students needed online. Overall results show that students use Moodle to access notes rather than as an online learning environment where interaction between peers and instructor should have been done. The mapping results show that modules are present on Moodle to support learners in their studies.

The research is descriptive in approach, and depended on the social survey method for data collection from a sample of 63 social work students. Data collection has been carried out by using special Scale which designed to measure students' dispositions, attitudes, Constraints toward Moodle application and Constraints of its use and utilization. Also the research depended on Focus Group Discussion as an additional tool for collecting data from two students groups. Among the most important results of the research is that the percentage strength of the dimensions of the scale came as follows: students' dispositions for the use of Moodle, its knowledge and actual use, and finally, the relational strength of students attitudes about Moodle. Also the results showed a high degree of the relative strength of the Constraints dimension. Then the most important recommendations is the positive handling of these constraints and assigning more attention to them. Moreover, Social Work Academics should encouraged to offer their electronic courses regularly and systematically and to encourage their students to take advantage of E-learning applications which may reflect positively on developing methods of Social Work Education.","","978-1-4673-9431-4","10.1109/ECONF.2015.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478274","Social Work Education;E-learning;Moodle;Constraints.","Electronic learning;Data collection;Sociology","","1","","","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This project implements and uses the very popular Moodle open source learning management system in a Macau school to compare its performance against the locally developed system. The relative performance of the systems is compared from three bases - reflections by the teacher involved in using both systems, a questionnaire survey of school students on their experiences and perceptions of both systems, and a focus group of teachers. It is found that both students and teachers believe that learning management systems improve the school learning environment and encourage greater student efforts. Also, overall, it is found that the Moodle open source learning management system is easier to set up and manage, is more reliable and easier to use, and has much richer functionality than the local government sponsored alternative. Finally, it seems to be important for teachers to be closely involved in the adoption of a learning management system by a school so that they feel some responsibility in ensuring the success of the project. As a result of this project, we recommend that Macau schools change over to use the Moodle learning management system.","","978-0-7695-4960-6","10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542244","learning management system;virtual learning environment;Moodle;eClass;comparison;ICT (Information & Communications Technologies)","Education","","1","","25","IEEE","20 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and, in particular, Web Services are promising approaches for the integration of information systems by implementing reusable and interoperable services. The lack of integration between existing academic management and distance learning systems represents a problem for the institutions of higher education leading to the duplication of data and the lack of information coherence. This work contributes to the resolution of some of these problems by implementing a model of integration of the two systems used in most institutions of higher education: Moodle and Academic Management System. The model implemented through Web Services allows Moodle to get automatically information from academic management systems. In this way, we contribute to a significant reduction of Moodle administration tasks, increasing the quality of information that is provided to users, saving time, effort and reducing the number of errors inherent to manual tasks and the manipulation of information. This work also contributes in some way to an increase in the quality of education that is taught in institutions of higher education as it liberates teachers of some administrative tasks, allowing them to devote more time to their primary function. On the other hand, it also provides students with better information about their academic data.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-5-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5974211","Moodle;SiGES;Academic Management System;Web Services;SOA - Service Oriented Architecture","Silicon germanium;Silicon;Service oriented architecture;Education;Object oriented modeling;Software","","","","15","","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various types of tests and quizzes can pool questions from custom created databases. Students results can be analyzed identifying questions that were either are too difficult, or to easy to answer. Such questions can be removed from databases without recreating existing tests. In order to improve lecturer productivity, automatic grading is preferred. Typical questions that can be included in tests with automatic grading are multiple choice, short answer, matching pairs, and similar questions types where there are one or more predictable correct answers. However, some student tasks are not so easy to grade automatically. In such situations lecturer must show more creativity when using Moodle, and creating tests.

The connection with Moodle allows teachers and students to access the lab remotely using their credentials as student / teacher of a regular course. The connection between Matlab / Simulink and the experimental platform is made by converting a BiegleBone Black microcontroller card into a system that acquires signals from a shaft encoder that measures the angular position of the servo and generates the PWM outputs to manipulate a VoltPaQ X1 source from Quanser that feeds the servo motor. The Matlab / Simulink connection with the BiegleBone Black card is done using the UDP protocol with a sampling time of 0.02 seconds, in this way the control routines can be programmed directly in Matlab / Simulink. As the connection is made using aleatory access tools, it is not adequate for real time feedback loop, but only a small disturbance is observed during the first 15 seconds. This 15 seconds time interval is considered as the requisite for the system to reach a stand by position, so that the feedback control system can be initialized and ensure it works correctly in real time.","","978-1-5386-5586-3","10.1109/ICA-ACCA.2018.8609733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609733","Remote labs;Moodle;Automatic Control;MATLAB;Simulink","Matlab;Servomotors;Software packages;Shafts;Pulse width modulation;Visualization","","1","","23","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The preliminary survey shows that 23.2% respondents had committed the act of plagiarism when doing assignments in E-learning in the past. Due to the lack of plagiarism detection feature in Moodle-based E-learning system, thus this research proposes a plagiarism detection feature as a plug-in for the E-learning system. The plagiarism detection plug-in handles assignments that are in the format of text documents. The plug-in makes use of Winnowing algorithm for fingerprinting the assignment documents and the hashing technique chosen for the Winnowing algorithm is Rolling Hash. The similarity value is calculated using Jaccard Coefficient. As a demonstration of feasibility, the implementation is done in Moodle-based E-learning UMN. The test results show the combinations of parameters (k-gram, window length, and the base prime number) for the plug-in and the f-measure.

On the other hand, common MOOC platform (such as Courser a, Udacity, edX, etc.) lacks functional modules specifically designed for English translation learning. Hence, it can not satisfy the requirements of the learning. To solve this problem, we studied an ET-MOOC platform, which is designed specially for English translation learning.

This paper present a fully automated portable attendance system which can be used to keep attendance log of students in educational institutes. This module is useful to take attendance of students for individual lectures and to produce an attendance report as per the need.","","978-1-5090-0774-5","10.1109/RTEICT.2016.7808198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7808198","Biometric sensor;Embedded Linux;Learning Management System (LMS);Portable Attendance System;Raspberry Pi (Rpi);Wi-Fi","Fingerprint recognition;Databases;Servers;Economic indicators;Authentication;Fingers;IEEE 802.11 Standard","","4","","9","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is specially true in the case of distance learning, where there are no physical interactions between students, so their student life is totally isolated from their everyday life (e.g. students do not go out together, since they may live in different cities or even countries although they study the same subjects). All these points suggest that the use of social networks for distance teaching has clear advantages that can be harnessed. In order to achieve the aforementioned benefits, we are working on integrating a commonly used LMS, Moodle, into one of the most widely-used social network, Facebook.

Data stored in an e-learning platform database include user-platform interaction events (counts of scrolls, mouse clicks or page loads), platform access times per session or in total, times between events and various assessment scores such as grades per quiz or per session test, final grades, etc. In the present paper we focus on the time between actions (TBA) taken by the learner while he/she interacts with the platform. TBA values relay information on the mode of interaction of an individual learner with the platform. The two major questions addressed are (i) whether TBA values follow any probability density function (PDF) and if so, which is the PDF that optimally fits the data, and (ii) whether the parameters of such optimally fitted PDFs might serve as features for the clustering of the learning content modules or sessions into clusters of similar characteristics or functionalities. Results verify that skewed (asymmetric) PDFs can be fitted on the TBA value histograms with adequate accuracy. Furthermore, the parameters of few optimally fitted PDFs, used as a feature vector, result in a meaningful clustering of learning content parts into clusters of similar “character”. Clustering results may then be used as a recommendation to the course designer / instructor, to improve content structure or to optimally distribute/sequence parts of the course material.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942969","Educational data mining;clustering;maximum likelihood parameter estimation;moodle;e-learning","Data mining;Electronic learning;Databases;Probability density function;Tools;Time-frequency analysis","","4","","27","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a web-based tool, Moodle offers the possible way to deliver courses which include an enormous variety of information sources - links to multimedia, websites and image - which are hard to deliver in a traditional teaching atmosphere. The converse (chat) activity module in moodle allows participants to encompass a realtime synchronous discussion in a moodle course. A teacher can organize users into groups within the course or within particular activities. This paper aims in efficient group formation of learners in a collaborative learning environment so that every individual in the group is benefitted.

Countless case-studies have identified weak points in the ever popular open-source system and sometimes, found solutions. Comparisons were made with other popular learning management systems (LMS), either commercial or free and open-source, with mixed results. These comparisons were usually employed as the tools for choosing one LMS over another, in the preliminary phase of adopting or developing a new e-learning platform. However, if the platform already exists, and has been functioning for a decent number of years, is it still necessary to test its usability? Considering that Moodle is currently on a bi-annual cycle for official releases and the online world is a very dynamic environment in need of constant adapting, the answer seems to be affirmative. Then, what are the main ways in which to test the usability of a learning platform (Moodle in particular), with its own characteristics which sets it apart from the general considerations of a web platform? Which of these methods are best suited for the different types of analyses we call “usability”?

In addition, conventional security software requires tuning effort and may not be able to detect many web attacks. For this reasons, security becomes a worldwide objective to many technological systems including Learning Management Systems (LMSs) such as Moodle. In this work, we propose a secured multi agent system (MAS) with an interceptor IIS module (IIISM) which denies malicious user access by adding a security layer to any web application including the LMS Moodle environment. The IIISM extends the IIS Server and listens to any http request targeting the web application and the LMS Moodle. While, the analysis and the design of the MAS architecture are based on the Gaia methodology, the agents were implemented using the JADE agents' middleware. This security layer overcomes the hacker attack based on the SQL injection and the cross site scripting for Moodle environment. In a first scenario, a student is requesting a course, the MAS validate this request, and the web page is displayed normally. A second scenario presents the URL and form based for the SQL injection attack by a hacker. The MAS agents detect the attack and and they respond by a denial of access to this malicious user. Moreover, this proposed security layer can be easily extended to include other security detection modules which correspond to common web vulnerabilities.","","978-1-4673-7504-7","10.1109/ICDIPC.2016.7470802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470802","web security;cyber security;Multi-agent system;Gaia methodology;JADE;SQL injection;cross site scripting;LMS;Moodle","Security;Monitoring;Ontologies;Detectors;Containers;Web services;Multi-agent systems","","5","1","18","IEEE","19 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As for now, Moodle doesn't have capability to grade essay question automatically, so teachers should grade all the submitted answers by students one by one. This is a problem for teachers because when two sentences are being compared, they don't only compare them syntactically, but also semantically. Our research proposes an essay grading module to help teachers in term of grading answers syntactically using common tasks in natural language processing such as formalization, sentence detection, stemming, POS (Part of Speech) tagging, and tokenizer. The developed module consists of one grader component and two plugins integrated to Moodle, one is “essayinagrader” plugin for the question type interface and the other is “igsuggestion” plugin for the quiz report interface. To grade an answer, “igsuggestion” plugin will use the developed grader component. This component utilizes INANLP, a NLP tool for Indonesian language, to process the chosen NLP tasks. In addition of INANLP, this component also uses WordNet thesaurus to compare synonyms and Jaro-Winkler algorithm to calculate string distance. Test results show that the developed module can grade answers with the same representation correctly. However, for answers with different representation, it will classify those differences as a false answer.","","978-1-5090-5671-2","10.1109/ICODSE.2016.7936117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936117","quiz;essay;INANLP;Moodle;plugin;grading","Thesauri;Pragmatics;Encoding","","6","","18","IEEE","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the flexibility of LMS to deliver the learning materials in various ways and approaches. However, the heterogeneous of students' behavior, the diversity of learning materials and the complexity of hyperlink for navigation are the main factors of limitation in LMS and can caused cognitive overload among students. Many literatures show that, providing an e-learning system that considers student preferences and needs can improve student performances and understanding. Therefore, this research proposed a new framework to enhance LMS to support adaptive features. The proposed enhancement of LMS is implemented in Moodle platform which includes major adaptation features based on visual and verbal dimension of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) and the student's knowledge level. The enhanced framework is organized into three models; domain model, student model and adaptive model that need to interact together to perform adaptively in presenting the learning materials. Three multi-agent components have been added to the Moodle platform to implement the adaptation. The current Moodle repository has also been modified by creating additional fields that are necessary for adaptation.","","978-1-5090-1125-4","10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2016.7519230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519230","adaptive;leraning management system;Moodle;learning style;knowledge level;agent","Navigation;Adaptation models;Education","","3","","16","IEEE","25 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first provide an overview of the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies. We then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and standard regressions. Our analyses show that the results of predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are collected within a single institution, strongly vary across courses. Thus, the portability of the prediction models across courses is low. In addition, we show that for the purpose of early intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into account, LMS data are of little (additional) value.

For this case study, Moodle, a medium-scale (approx. 625K lines of code), open-source PHP application with a rich AC model was investigated. Results revealed that, although very complex by design, implemented AC models may comparatively be very simple, suggesting that developers tend to maintain a low complexity level when implementing ACs.

This article proposes an approach for solving these problems based on the concept of perception, using the multiagent system paradigm. The system is composed by intelligent agents, which act in a Moodle discussion forum using an AIML knowledge base. Agents solve questions about matters discussed at the forum, and they use perception to recommend the implementation of activities that the student has not done. The results from simulations based on real courses already completed show that there is a decrease in the workload of tutors. Students are reminded the deadline for the tasks automatically. It was necessary to create hundreds of AIML rules to get answers to good level.

This could lead to the failure of these educational programs. Furthermore, the need for information security knowledge is no longer only of concern to organizations, but has also become a concern for individuals using online services for personal entertainment, social networking, banking, and other activities. Thus, there is a need for “cyber security” education for both individuals and organizations. Such cyber security educational programs should be based on sound pedagogical theories. One such a pedagogically sound approach that could potentially play a role in cyber security educational programs is “brain compatible learning”. This paper will perform a critical evaluation of an existing information security education course, and evaluate the subject matter in terms of brain compatible learning approaches.

In this paper we apply process mining techniques to analyze such logs. We are interested in studying the students' use of the learning resources, the students' fitness with respect to the planned assignments and the relationship between the students' behaviour and their final marks, for instance. A log analysis system has been implemented based on a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) model checking tool and a set of general patterns making easier querying about students' behavioral aspects is proposed. The utility of the system is shown by means of the analysis of Moodle logs corresponding to a course related to Computer Science.","","978-1-5090-0778-3","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760720","","Model checking;Data mining;Computer science;Face;Information systems;Open systems;Learning management systems","","8","","29","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apart from the difficulties of allowing arbitrary student responses, of judging them for correctness or error, and of providing appropriate specific and contingent feedback, explicitly identifying a range of options or alternatives from which a student may make selections remains an unsolved research problem. The ""Knowledge Space Theory (KST)"" model of the domain ""problems"" provides some opportunity for response options. The ""Competence Based Assessment (COMBA)"" model of the required knowledge provides some opportunity for relevant feedback. The paper explores ComKoS, a model which integrates both approaches.

In the same line, one third of all children not in primary school are those that present disabilities. This situation becomes more complicated in developing countries due the lack of educational services and tools adapted to needs of children with disabilities as well as the poor connectivity of centers of special education to online resources. For these reasons, in this paper we present an approach to address three important aspects Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) as support tools for special education in Ecuador: the connectivity problems of centers of special education, the lack of online resources for children with disabilities, and the lack of tools to analyze the children and teachers perception about educational contents stored in VLE.

To tackle this problem, plagiarism detection tools are especially useful, not only in popular thinking as a deterrent for students, but also as an educational tool to raise students' awareness of the offence and to improve their academic skills. Commercial text matching tools (e.g. Turnitin) are at a high level of maturity. These tools offer the ability to interact with students, making them suitable for an educational objective. Additionally, they can be readily integrated into learning environments enabling uniform application at an institutional level. On the other hand, computer source code matching tools, despite their successful detection performance, are mostly used as standalone tools that are difficult to adopt at an institutional level. The research presented in this paper describes the trial and evaluation of a tool that is seamlessly integrated into the Moodle virtual learning environment. The tool provides code similarity scanning capability within Moodle so that institutions using this learning environment could apply this tool easily at an enterprise level. Additionally, the educational aspects available in text matching tools have been added into the tool capability. The tool relies on two popular code matching services, MOSS and JPlag, as underlying engines to provide good code similarity scanning performance. The evaluation of the tool from both academics' and students' perspectives indicates a considerable level of interest in using the tool, and supports the suitability of this tool for wider institutional adoption in the computing education community.","","978-0-7695-4960-6","10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542245","academic integrity;plagiarism detection tool;computer source code","Plagiarism;Programming profession;Education;Prototypes;Detectors;Computers","","8","","19","IEEE","20 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has become clear that educators will be able to tailor their courses by merging the two previously mentioned fields and by carrying out MOOC-based data mining, targeting pedagogical aspects. This field of research seems promising and important, thus a faculty at the University of Szeged has created its own MOOC educational platform which has been set to facilitate data mining by implementing a wide range of logging algorithms. The data would be processed through a complex Artificial Intelligence program, which, in the short term, could reveal new and exciting pedagogical findings, while in the long run, the supervisors could put together a platform that would help and notify educators about relevant information.

In Algeria the mobile penetration rate stands at over 111% and 21% with 3G. Since most our students have access to mobile technology, three in five were smartphones, this number that is expected to climb to over 65% by the end of 2015. Using this technology would encourage students to use their phones to send questions to their teachers, see the platform, ads, grades, listen a podcast and snip the Quick Response (QR) codes. We propose some aspects of using QR codes in Learning Management System (LMS) at the National Institute of Telecommunications and TIC (INTTIC). QR Code is still relatively new and still in its infancy in education. The use of QR codes in INTTIC-LMS can be placed in the context of mobile learning. We carried out the implementation of vCard, Quizzes and QR voice as a new tool in the Moodle platform. The QR code contains the URL of the page on one particular Moodle course and quiz are added to the bottom of Moodle. Students' satisfaction had been acknowledged as an important factor in order to estimate the effectiveness of a blended learning course.","","978-1-4673-9431-4","10.1109/ECONF.2015.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478223","Quick Response (QR) Code;2D Bar Code;Moodle;Blended learning;Mobile Learning","Mobile communication;Electronic learning;Digital audio broadcasting;Mobile handsets;Telecommunications;Internet","","3","","20","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The disadvantage is that students guess answers to the questions they are not sure about. The scores of these tests are highly valuable as they are used by the universities to admit the students for the course. Students are more focused on practicing such questions on online websites by giving mock tests. By analyzing the data, we can infer about the strategies used by students to attempt the test and identify answers which were guessed correctly. Such analysis can further assist in developing a feedback system that motivates students to enhance their performance by identifying their weaknesses and strengths. The students and assessors can be made aware of the student's possible weak areas in sections where he has achieved a good score.

Later, they will be singled out and delivered through e-learning sessions using the faculty's e-learning portal. Emphasis has been put on adapting interactive components of the platform to planned interactions, both in teacher-student-teacher and student-student-student relations. Obligatory remote exchange of information among the design team was taken as one of boundary conditions for the project. In this paper, general phrases and suggestions were determined based on example issues of concern, thematically related to planning and organization of distributed computing procedures for local ICT networks, which would enable re-entrant and multi-user numerical computations and data acquisition in real time.","","978-1-4577-1829-8","10.1109/EEEIC.2012.6221557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6221557","e-learning;blended course;course design;features of moodle;pedagogy of higher education institutions","Electronic learning;Laboratories;Resource management;Java;Educational institutions;Portals","","","","9","IEEE","21 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this is not the same thing in education institution like a university. Each business process in the university will most likely be disrupted whenever a staff takes a leave or even resign. Several reasons arise to justify this behavior, like all other staffs are already busy, that is not my KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to be concerned, and I do not have the knowledge to perform such job. The third reason explains the absence of knowledge management in the business process. Since each university has a unique process business, a system for managing knowledge should be flexible enough to accommodate every possible process. One of the advantages of using knowledge management is the possibility to provide eLearning on top of the knowledge management system. While eLearning should also be flexible to accommodate every possible business process, it should also support reusability to ensure effective and efficient process with minimum time-to-deploy.

Generic instructional design editors fail in bridging the gap between how they design a learning scenario and how the learning session can be set up within the target LMS. If LMSs could be able to explicit their intrinsic and implicit learning design model, it can be exploited as a proprietary format to build tools and facilities dedicated to this LMS. The research presented in this paper aims to present our method in terms of necessary analysis and steps for the identification and the formalization of Moodle instructional design language. The method takes into account three different viewpoints: a viewpoint centered on the LMS macro-HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces), a functional viewpoint and a micro viewpoint.

Technology progress in the field of learning has evolved especially with the use of e-learning and now with the emergence of a new concept called m-learning due to mobile technologies, which are probably the most influential technology for teaching and learning in the next decade. Internet access remains inaccessible to most of our students. But almost all students have access to mobile technology. Nevertheless, the m-learning has some constraints in the use of mobile technologies such as the size of the screen which is too small for reading, battery life that is in constant progress but still low for e-learning applications, user interfaces that are not user-friendly on most mobile phones and diversity of mobile devices and the rapidly changing trends suggest producing “LMS mobiles” adaptable to a wide range of mobiles. To avoid redundancy in the reproduction of content that exists in the e-learning environment, we combined in this approach the use of mobile device in the blended learning to offer to our students the opportunity to be mobile and use the mobile as the medium of information. In this paper the benefits of mobile-learning and its use in the INTTIC's Moodle platform are presented. A new way to send information to different learners is developed, relying on the multimedia podcasting technology.

The ESP course enabled the developers to achieve a higher degree of professional focus than conventional ESP textbooks provide. This paper focuses on the design of the course syllabus, its organization in LMS MOODLE, and analysis of the two year approbation of both experimental ESP course and Database Systems course given in English. Although the results of the first year ESP course approbation were successful, the survey conducted at the end of the first year teaching DB course in English highlighted some problem zones. This resulted in modifying the way of teaching the ESP course during the second year approbation. In particular, some elements of the flipped classroom methodology were introduced with the aim of allocating more time for discussing complex concepts of the discipline in class so the students become familiar with them in advance while doing their homework. The results of the survey conducted at the end of the second year approbation as well as the results of the second year DB course acquisition are discussed. Authors conclude that online component of the experimental ESP course makes it more flexible, allows adopting it to changing requirements of DB course lecturer which can be achieved only in case of close interdepartmental cooperation.

The latter are used as paradigms that comply with the educational scenarios of the i-Treasures project (www.i-treasures.eu), which refers to the intangible cultural heritage. Based on documental analysis, the pedagogical design strategies per semester were transcribed to concept maps and the dynamically (per week) estimated QoIs were presented as feedback to the teachers at the end of the first semester, so they could reflect and update their pedagogical planning, anticipating more enhanced QoI at the second one. The results presented here show the beneficial role of QoI to shift the educational scenarios and strategies towards a more dynamic design, yet taking into consideration the inherent tendencies and attitudes of the users' interaction within the b-learning context.","","978-9-8975-8133-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295017","Learning Scenarios;LMS Moodle;Quality of Interaction;Blended Learning;Fuzzy Logic-based Modelling;Pedagogical Planning;Rare & Contemporary Dance;i-Treasures","Planning;Least squares approximations;Context;Education;Data models;Adaptation models;Cultural differences","","","","19","","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MRP method is designed around a meta-principle that considers the project learning activity as a role-playing game based on two projects: a learning project and an engineering project. The meta-principle is complemented by five principles that provide a framework to guide the working practices of student teams: distribution of responsibilities; regular interactions and solicitations within the team; anticipation and continuous improvement; positive interdependence and alternating individual/collective work; and open communication and content management. This paper presents the implementation of MRP in a course teaching software engineering, UML language, and project management. The results show that MRP helped the course's students to acquire important professional knowledge and skills, experience near-real-world professional realities, and develop their abilities to work both in teams and autonomously.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2015.2462809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219467","E-learning;higher education;Moodle;multi-role project;project-based learning;STEM","Materials requirements planning;Games;Web sites;Learning systems;Unified modeling language;Content management;Project management","","48","","38","IEEE","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PBL has also been employed across a wide range of disciplines and areas in education primarily medical, engineering, and business. The pedagogy that has been practiced for decades using the traditional face-to-face activities largely benefited from all the online technologies in empowering the learners in a non-classical structure. Computer technologies were exploited by researcher and educators at different capacities in order to add a value to PBL. Online implementations ranged from using basic communication tools to building fully-fledged systems and websites. Several research projects succeeded in building comprehensive, feature-rich, PBL-tailored learning environments. On the other hand, some implementation were either partially useful or inherently deficient. Although many attempts achieved attractive results, they either ended up unused or unsupported by the institution. The reasons in many cases were purely technical and not related to the suitability of the environment to the pedagogy. This paper describes the need, design, and implementation of a conceptual model to allow students to effectively collaborate using a customizable framework for PBL courses. In this paper, we present ePBL , an online environment for PBL suitable for educational institutions at any level. We also share our experiences and recommendations for developing similar pedagogy-specific solutions. We also describe the details of implementing and testing of ePBL at Qatar University. Analysis of students activities along with their feedbacks is also detailed in this paper.","2165-9567","978-1-4673-6110-1","10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530260","problem-based learning;e-learning;moodle;collaborative learning","Least squares approximations;Electronic learning;Collaboration;Internet;Conferences;Communities","","14","","24","IEEE","13 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With acceptance of this electronic means of assessing students, many questions arise about this method. What should be the format of e-assessment? What amount of time? What kinds of questions should be asked (multiple choice, short answer, etc.)? These are only a few of the many different questions. In addition, educators have always had to contend with the possibility that some students might cheat on an examination. It is widely known that students are often times more technologically savvy than their professors. So how does one prevent students from cheating on an e-assessment? Understandably, given the amount of information available on e-assessments and the variety of formats to choose from, choosing to administer e-assessments over paper-based assessments can lead to confusion on the part of the professor. This paper presents helpful guidance for lecturers who want to introduce e-assessments in their class, and it provides recommendations about the technical infrastructure to implement to avoid students cheating. It is based on literature review, on an international survey that gathers insights and experiences from lecturers who are using e-assessment in their class, and on technological evaluation of e-assessment infrastructure.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-2957-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363325","e-assessment;evaluation;competencies;technology;Moodle;grading;cheating","Task analysis;Education;Internet;Best practices;Testing;Tools;Media","","9","","28","IEEE","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, the literature presents some positive results when the paradigm used to introduce the subject is Visual Programming (VP), where the learners use icons to build their programs. This approach is successful even with young learners. In this context, a relevant question is whether, and how, the Visual Programming can help learners to understand a traditional textual programming language.

A quantitative research approach was used to conduct a survey study using 67 university lecturers who volunteered to participate in the study. The participants were drawn from the Faculties of Education, Engineering, Humanities, Social Science and Science. Of the 67 participants, 66 (99%) are aware of the availability of Blackboard and Moodle learning management softwares, and only 1 (1%) claim to be ignorant of the platforms. 43 of the participants make use of Blackboard, 11 make use of Moodle while 13 do not use either platforms for reasons of preferences to conventional traditional teaching and learning methods. Although the use of Blackboard and Moodle are convenient platforms for the creation and distribution of teaching materials, course assessment, communication and collaboration between users; such platforms are supposedly not suitable in teaching and management of studio based courses, and analytical courses in some disciplines due the users limited experience in the platforms. Furthermore, performing logistic regression analysis on the data set suggests that respondents who indicated strongly agree are 4.96 times more likely to use Blackboard (Odd Ratio = 4.96), and 1.00 times more likely to use Moodle (Odd Ratio=1,00) than those who strongly disagree.","","978-1-5090-5443-5","10.1109/SAI.2017.8252245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252245","usability;measurement;learning management software;regression model","Tools;Usability;Electronic learning;Conferences;Learning management systems","","","","13","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To measure how students and teachers are going to accept and use a specific e-learning technology or service, an appropriate instrument is needed. In this paper common theories that can be used for measuring students' acceptance of e-learning technologies and services are presented. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was used to develop the measurement instrument. The measurement items have been adapted to Moodle, an open source web-based Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Empirical data was conducted using an online survey with undergraduate students (n=235). To understand students’ perceptions about using Moodle, the UTAUT research model and hypothesized relationships between UTAUT constructs were empirically tested using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The results indicate that performance expectancy and social influence have a significant impact on students’ attitudes towards using Moodle. Social influence and attitudes toward using are significant determinants of students' behavioral intention. Students’ behavioural intentions were shown to be strong and significant determinant of actual use of Moodle. The implications and limitations of the present study are also discussed.","","978-1-4244-5719-9","10.1109/eLmL.2010.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5430017","e-learning;VLE;acceptance;UTAUT;SEM","Electronic learning;Mobile computing;Instruments;Numerical analysis;Environmental management;Space technology;Blogs;Informatics;Computer science;Appropriate technology","","62","","16","IEEE","15 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online learning helps teaching difficulties in conventional learning where learning process of individual student is hard to know in detailed by the teacher because of too many students in a single class. With online learning assisted by Learning Management System (LMS) teachers can know each student individual learning process by analyzing student log activity on the LMS which is often called by behavioral tracking. LMS used as research material is Moodle that has been applied to the Computer Science Education Department, UPI. The purpose of this research is to find learning status of each student by analyzing student's behavior while using the Moodle LMS. One of behavioral tracking model which can be used to determine the student's learning status is Monitoring Online Course with Log Data (MOCLog) model. By combining the concept map, and solution map, this model can analyze log data on Moodle LMS, and generate learning status of each individual student. Then the teacher can determine what behavioral traits are dominant, and most influential on learning with association rule data mining technique with apriori algorithms.

We have chosen the academic environment as the ongoing contextual setting for our system. From this perspective, we designed Proactive Scenarios for an automatic and enhanced management of the online learning and teaching activities on Moodle™ for both student and teacher users. Due to the diversity of the potential contexts and situations arising from the user's activity, we developed two kinds of Proactive Scenarios. The first type or Meta Scenarios are responsible for capturing the changes in the outward context. The second type or Target Scenarios are triggered off by Meta Scenarios and aim to undertake the appropriate actions in response to the conditions of the user's contextual situation. In order to test and validate the capability of our software as well as to analyse its context related outcomes we have performed empirical studies. The experiments consisted in creating two groups of students, on the one hand the study group, which used the Moodle™ platform enhanced by PCAS, and on the other hand the control group, which used the standard version of Moodle™. The subsequent data analysis showed significant differences in specific related results such as notable advantage of the study group outcomes in the category of passing the final exam, where the study group has performed by 11 percentage points better than the control group.","","978-1-4673-2437-3","10.1109/CogSIMA.2013.6523857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523857","Proactive System;Proactive Computing;Situational Awareness;Context Aware System;Context Situation Management;Cognitive Scenarios","Principal component analysis;Context;Context-aware services;Software;Computer science;Databases;Electronic learning","","3","","23","IEEE","6 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An information artifact (IA) can contain any kind of information. In order to increase transparency in the usage and design of online and offline IA, the TEDS framework was implemented in Moodle as an electronic evaluation activity (TEDS*MOODLE) to evaluate the Moodle course rooms.

Student role changed to be knowledge and information hunter rather than receiver, and teaching, meanwhile, is becoming a peripheral activity. Several interactive and new methods of learning has evolved in the last two decades aimed to utilizing the information and communication technology tools to improve the educational process availability and accessibility. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading, and course evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate different open source learning management systems that were under consideration to be implemented by the College of Medicine, King Saud University (CMKSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study reviewed open source and commercial LMS systems as a future strategy. Objectives: the main objective of the current study was to assess the open source LMS systems based on conducting literature review and practical evaluation. The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions, and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.","","978-1-4244-8618-2","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569","","Least squares approximation;Electronic learning;Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Information technology;Information systems","","22","","32","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In education, the integration of web 2.0 technologies and tools into educational and institutional practice is called eLearning 2.0. Researches stress on the importance of implementing eLearning 2.0 in the learning process. Universities and schools are investing substantial amounts of time and money in implementing learning management systems (LMS). If not designed with eLearning 2.0 support in mind, the LMS can pose difficulty for instructors and students to benefit from these technologies through LMS directly. The aim of this study is to evaluate the readiness of learning management systems to support eLearning 2.0. This research reviewed the literature for the most common web 2.0 tools used in eLearning process. Six tools were identified Wikis, blogs, RSS, pod casts, book marking and virtual environments. Then an evaluation model was developed and applied on two respective learning management systems Black Board and MOODLE. The results of readiness evaluation shows that MOODLE is more ready for eLearning 2.0 than Black Board. Anyhow, the findings of this study provide several important implications for learning management system research and management.","","978-0-7695-5036-7","10.1109/ECONF.2013.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745527","eLearning 2.0;Web 2.0;Social Learning;Learning Management System (LMS)","Electronic learning;Web 2.0;Blogs;Information services;Electronic publishing;Least squares approximations","","11","","44","IEEE","20 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is one that faces numerous challenges in terms of the effective management when introducing a change for pedagogical practice that involves the ubiquitous use of computing and ICT against a global user base that is influenced by known and unknown barriers to technology adoption. It is suggested that that with a history of organizational change considerations being a pre-dominantly strategic business related construct, and technology related change being a predominantly project managed or service model construct, that a traditional CM or project approach may not adequately address many barriers to technology adoption. As has occurred in other business/IT related interactions such as the Information systems strategy triangle, learning using technology requires a clear marriage of the technological managerial and pedagogical domains. Organizational, Business, IS, and education strategy all need to interact synergistically in order to move forward with technology use for education. The purpose of this project was to conduct a study that focused on the broad context of technology barriers faced by students using technology around a Moodle based online learning environment. The underlying objective was to examine the interaction between change management activity and student perceptions of both technology barriers and change focusing on encouraging the adoption of technology for learning.

There is a need to make e-learning available to deaf people, deaf people facing difficulties in learning, for example, when a lecturer demonstrates on the black board, they usually face the wall, making lip-reading impossible. Moreover, unless they have a note-taker, they will not be able to write down the necessary information and watch the lecturer/interpreter/lip-speaker at the same time. Deaf children in Jordan are not far from this. They face even more problems because of the lack of educational infrastructure, resources and specialist provision. In this paper, with the aim of finding the feasibility of using current open source Learning Management Systems (LMS) we evaluated four open source LMS and recommended one of them as most adaptable for deaf children in Jordan. This recommendation came from testing the evaluated LMS against the developed key requirement. These developed key requirements are based on literature; the guidelines of California department of education, these guidelines contain suggestions to be used in classifying, assessing, planning, and providing appropriate educational services to all children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Additionally, we used some aspects from the LMS evaluation tool user guide issue 1.2. The evaluation of process involved examining factors and aspects related to LMS. During the evaluation of four open source LMS, we noticed the main factors that affect the adaptation such as language support, hardware/software specifications, RDBMS, LMS standards & specifications compliance, administrative tools, assessment tools, collaboration and communications tools, and customization of LMS. By the end of this evaluation, we found that the most suitable open source e-learning environment and LMS to be utilised to deaf children needs was “Moodle” LMS. Therefore Moodle LMS is adapted to the deaf children in Jordan.","","978-1-4244-5263-7","10.1109/ICIME.2010.5477480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477480","E-learning;LMS;Deaf;RDBMS;LMS Standards & Specifications Compliance;Administrative Tools;Assessment Tools;Open Source LMS Collaboration and Communications Tools;Customization of LMS","Deafness;Least squares approximation;Electronic learning;Guidelines;Collaborative software;Watches;Testing;Auditory system;Open source hardware;Open source software","","5","","26","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

E-learning systems are mostly unadapted to mobile platforms because they do not use responsive web design and progressive enhancement based on browser, device or feature detection. This paper presents the evolutionary cycle, current status and potential development of new platforms for e/m-learning in higher education. Educational computer games that serve as a motivational element in e/m-learning are presented, as well as the data structures that can complement the existing models of e/m-learning. The University of Rijeka uses MudRi e-learning system, which is based on Moodle open source software. This system collects data on the activity of participants in the educational process, which is suitable for data mining. A preliminary research on the correlation between the activity in forum discussions and the course pass or fail grade is carried out. The possibility of using data mining based on the data structure of the Moodle system and the models of e/m-learning and learning through play is described, aiming at finding optimal ways of learning and optimal learning results. Finally, a model of integrated system user interaction on which our future research will be based is presented.","","978-953-233-077-9","10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859665","","Games;Computers;Electronic learning;Data mining;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","","2","","22","","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the accumulated event log, an experiment to automatically generate pivot and TSCS tables with the developed Excel macros was performed. As a result, both overall and individual viewpoints could be visualized for course material page views within classes and outside of class, viewing of all course materials and individual course materials, and viewing behavior of collected and individual students. The generated pivot and TSCS tables could be used to clearly identify students who did not open the course materials during class and those who opened the course materials later than instructed by the teacher.

Such extended data is implicitly and automatically obtained through the analysis of the user behavior and the corresponding interactions with the system and other users. We developed a tool (TIG) that enables the dynamic discovery and management of new groups based on the generation of extended user profiles in interactive applications or environments. The main goal of the tool is to support the integration of the above concept and its associated functionalities into existing or newly developed interactive applications.

In this research, they were used with the objective of making the students design and produce Digital Educational Resources (DER), in this case vodcasts. These vodcasts covered all the curriculum content of the discipline of Geology, 12thGrade, in order to promote learning and to verify their effects on educational outcomes. To achieve these objectives we have developed, over a school year, teaching and active learning strategies, where students were asked to search, select and critically evaluate information to produce vodcasts and reflect on these processes. The vodcasts were produced taking into account some of the principles of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the cognitive load theory for the production of multimedia messages. Students joined with enthusiasm and commitment to this methodology and have made a very positive review, stating that this allowed them to acquire scientific and technical knowledge, develop digital and communication skills, and work in teams, in a learning environment that provided them with a high degree of freedom, personal satisfaction and autonomy. The vodcasts were inserted into a rich technological classroom environment, such as the use of Moodle and the production of ePortfolios.

Learning through mobile devices, known in literature as mobile learning (m-learning), highlights the acquisition of context-oriented contents. One of the promising technologies to be used for this goal is a variant of barcodes; quick response codes (QR-codes). In the suggested learning system, QR codes will allow an automatic authentication on moodle platform by the student through his profile and his mobile device. These codes enclose the necessary information to connect the context-oriented materials and the learning places. Each student follows guidelines with the instructions of the learning places to visit, informing about the QR codes to decrypt. The detected information is sent to the moodle platform asking for the context-oriented learning material.

However, since using this technology, many studies have shown a high level of criticism directed at the failure of LMS to create an interactive learning environment and to improve learning outcomes. Many studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this technology in relation to enhancing student learning, to identify the problems and failure aspects of these systems. In addition, this paper seeks to discuss the causes of these problems and the reasons behind such failures with reference to the main activities of online course management systems.

The conventional teaching model of the subjects of initiation to programming is based on a set of tasks that usually result in a series of difficulties for the students which leads to an exhaustive monitoring by the teachers. It turns out that one of the main problems is that students often do not know if their work is correct (i.e. whether it works for a pre-defined data set) until it is reviewed and evaluated by the teacher. In this context, the Virtual Learning Environment becomes an attractive and interesting tool to help teach (and learn) programming. One of these tools is VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) a plugin of Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). We believe that the use of VPL may represent a paradigm shift for students, but also, and especially for teachers, because teachers will have to spend much more time upstream to prepare tasks and activities, test the environment and verify validation of the data. However, it is important to note that downstream teacher effort can significantly reduce because students do not need as much attention given that feedback on the quality and functionality of the code developed is immediate. This work is a part of a PhD in Research at Information Technology in the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and has been developed from the last 12 months. This Ph.D. research aims to analyze the VPL's integration potential in the programming teaching-learning process in higher education. It also aims to verify if, with VPL, it is possible to make student's learning more effective and autonomous, with less time and effort spent by teachers in assignments evaluation. In the present article, we will present a work-in-progress where we will show how VPL was introduced in a teaching-learning process supported on JAVA programming. The teaching method uses EduScrum methodology and is included in the course of Computer Engineering of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP / P.PORTO).

Nowadays, various Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are used as a supporting tool in electronic education. LMS Moodle is one of the well-known systems from the open source category. These, unlike their ancestors, focus on the personalization to the students' needs, i.e. they enable the students to manage the course passing via organization of time spent learning the content and amount of received information within certain time period - one week, for instance. In this case we talk about adaptive systems or the systems with the elements of adaptation. Despite the fact that adaptive systems aim to adapt to the learner's needs to the maximum extent that is possible according to their programmed structure, very often they respond only to the stimulus stated right after the course enrolment. As an example we may use the entrance questionnaire that is used to find out the age, gender, education, favorite color, etc. Such learner's responses serve to modify the study material according to certain defined rules. In our case, psychological test in the form of interactive video that was created by the team consisting of a psychologist, a teacher and students, was used to determine the personality type of a learner. Following investigation showed that the personality type of an individual influences not only his/her behaviour towards others but also individual activities, e.g. the way of filling in the questionnaire focusing on effectiveness of teaching aids. Further research of interactive video usage is planned to deal with the personalization of e-courses according to the personality type, eventually also to the learner's mood.","","978-1-4577-1747-5","10.1109/ICL.2011.6059637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059637","Interactive video;Petri Nets;Psychological test;Learner's personality","Petri nets;Psychology;Educational institutions;Conferences;Mathematical model;Adaptation models","","10","","14","IEEE","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently the requirements of the platforms used are eminent. One of the requirements on which our work has focused is how to make the job of a tutor, automatic and intelligent. Given that the role of a Tutor is reflected essentially by the appropriate decision-making to a critical situation, what the learner can pass. Depending on the situation, the decision of the tutor guides the student to an alternative or another in the pedagogical strategy. This tutorial is based on the flow of information returned by the system that summarizes the traceability of the learner who attended a training session. To achieve this goal, we started by studying the modeling approaches of information flows. Among these approaches we chose the workflow model that meets the needs of our conception of an automatic and intelligent tutor. The basic inputs of this workflow are the outputs of the GISMO tool that makes traceability of a learner who attends a course on Moodle. During the workflow life cycle, the motor of the latter is based on the fundamental characteristic which is the apprenticeship.

On the other hand, if there are problems, it is hard for the teacher to distinguish the exact cause. Students may encounter problems in understanding the materials or in the use of instruments and computer applications; without direct contact, it is virtually impossible for the teacher to motivate them to continue working despite the difficulties. Another challenge for the teacher is detecting which parts of the subject are most interesting to the students and which parts demand more attention and maybe different methodologies.

Kuwait University introduced the use of Blackboard in 2005 to be used by faculty members in support of their hybrid or blended teaching experience. Before the introduction of Blackboard, many faculty members used and continue to use Yahoo Groups as a simple alternative to learning management systems. This paper measures the perceptions of Kuwait University students of the use of Yahoo Groups as compared to Blackboard across level of education. A total of 102 students participated in the study by answering a structured questionnaire followed by a focus group to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Yahoo Groups vs. Blackboard. The results showed a great division across level of education, while the great majority of undergraduate students favor the use of Yahoo Groups over Blackboard, a narrow majority of graduate students favor the use of Blackboard. Yahoo Groups scored higher on simplicity, ease of use, and accessibility while Blackboard scored higher on student participation in the discussions and submitting assignments.","","978-1-4673-0798-7","10.1109/ITNG.2012.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209217","Learning Management Systems;E-Learning;University Students;Satisfaction","Educational institutions;Materials;Least squares approximation;Electronic learning;Electronic mail;Internet","","7","","13","IEEE","31 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this paper, we present an interactive cloud-based learning tool that allows students to interactively explore algebraic formulas, their corresponding graphs (including axes) and generating data. Our tool is designed with both curriculum and interactive systems support in mind and it integrates with existing classroom management platforms. Our implementation employs a careful division of work between client-side browsers and cloud servers to provide instant response times that are within human perception limits. We achieve these design goals by (1) client-side programming for interactive components, (2) sending student activity data to servers at different rates for different sharing types, and (3) align student's data with Moodle's (a popular open source classroom management system) schema. Twenty Math teachers were trained to teach Algebra to students using our interactive service. Over eighty percent of teachers trained with our system adopted it.

The “user-centered” philosophy of this tool is in perfect harmony with the concepts of modern marketing, ergonomics, and learning management. This new approach, as opposed to the traditional “page-centered” philosophy, puts the users' goals and intentions to the centre, and designs the services of the system accordingly. About 60 learners of technical teacher training took part simultaneously in processing the Educational technology and multimedia course, all their activities performed in Moodle learning environment were registered in a log file by the server. The processing of this log file was performed by the SPSS Web Mining for Clementine program. Here we are going to present the first results exposed by quality assurance in connection with the students' learning activity, the structure of the syllabus as well as the navigational opportunities. By analysis of student behavior we receive some beneficial information for course development and learning management which are applied in design of adaptive online learning in engineering education.","","978-1-4799-6065-1","10.1109/IEOM.2015.7093710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7093710","adaptive learning;web usage mining;engineering education","Web mining;Training;Engineering education;Knowledge engineering;Digital images","","5","","14","IEEE","27 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If so, users may not be aware of discussions happening on one site and are uncertain where to post their contributions. Therefore, there is a need for integrating different discussion sites. However, the integration is difficult due to different data formats. In this paper, an approach is presented that makes use of ontologies and enterprise integration patterns for seamlessly integrating discussion sites. Further, it is shown how discussions can be easily integrated with lecture recordings on a data level, and be stored for later reuse by using Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles.","","978-1-4799-2171-3","10.1109/ISM.2013.93","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746845","Web 2.0;Online Discussions;Ontology;Semantic Web","Web 2.0;Ontologies;Receivers;Discussion forums;Authentication;Facebook","","5","","28","IEEE","24 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we focused on analyzing characteristics both the learning behaviors and the nonintellectual factor of e-learners, such as emotion. We aimed to find the main factors which influence learner's achievements. These factors might be submit time of programs, login times, the frequency of assignment view, etc. Based on the analysis, we adopted The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and Felder & Solomon Learning Styles and Strategies surveys to obtain e-learner's emotion and learning style in a certain period of time or currently. Then we made the correlation analysis between e-learner's emotion, learning style and their achievements. The experimental results made a verification that positive emotion has a great influence on the user.

The basic idea was to offer the functionality of a microscope via an interactive application which is integrated within the LMS. The main advantages of that concept were saving costs, enhancing the flexibility for students and utilizing additional features and possibilities offered by new media. Cost saving was achieved by replacing hundreds of expensive physical microscopes by the virtual microscope, which can be used on any PC with a standard web browser. After more than 8 years the technology as well as the functionality of the VM 1.0 was now out-dated. We describe the stages to introduce a VM 2.0 within VMC/Moodle in order to help other universities who want to introduce a VM for their students to speed up the decision process and to avoid possible traps.","","978-1-4577-1747-5","10.1109/ICL.2011.6059540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059540","eLearning;virtual laboratory;new learning applications;multimedia applications","Microscopy;Educational institutions;Least squares approximation;Navigation;Conferences;Biomedical imaging;Software","","5","","16","IEEE","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, digital learning content authoring is often an expensive and time-consuming task that requires many distinct professional skills. One attempt to overcome it is the adoption of Learning Object Repositories (LOR), in order to smooth LO manipulation experiences for teachers and content authors. Some of its keys characteristics are: to promote LO dissemination and reuse to users in a unified spot; and, to serve LO through flexible searches and enforce a metadata standard classification. This paper proposes an innovative repository model to support LOR and their use in web-based courses in the context of an specific LMS, the Moodle environment. The model is flexible, enhances digital content searches and can be fully integrated with an institutional LMS.

This research adapts the Triple-Factor Approach that includes learning styles, motivation, and knowledge ability in determining learning type. The objective of the current research is to explore how the different ways and a different time in capturing activity log can affect the learning type identification. The activity logs were provided by Moodle. To provide the temporal data, the activity log data were collected on four different times. On each period, the data were captured both cumulatively and non-cumulatively. The results indicated that the learning types of the learners were very likely to change from time to time. The temporal data analysis showed that the way the learners learnt, their learning motivation, and learners' knowledge level were dynamic.

IoT plays a vital role in the education area where the need to have a “smart” environment instead of a conventional one has arisen. Many “smart” services are implemented in university campuses such as smart lighting, tracking and parking by using environment, security or safety sensors to detect motion, smoke, fire or water; automate the opening/closing of doors or lighting and monitoring university equipment [1]. However, these functionalities can be extended to the university Learning Management System (LMS) that is a centralized educational platform used by most universities to host, create, and deliver online courses to students. In this paper, we discuss the integration process between LMS and IoT, its importance in the education sector and its main applications. We emphasize on a “security” enhancement feature to be added to an existing university LMS, to meet the urgent need of secure access to campus events and reduce the risk of emergencies and public safety threats. The paper presents the design and implementation of the “security” feature that uses an Arduino IoT device to allow secure access to university events from MOODLE LMS.","","978-1-5386-4371-6","10.1109/COMAPP.2018.8460302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460302","Internet of Things (IoT);Learning Management System (LMS);e-learning trends;security enhancement;campus access;Arduino","Internet of Things;Security;Intelligent sensors;Electronic mail;Temperature sensors;Servers","","3","","12","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results of the course traffic analysis were estimated using association rules Discrete mathematics is compulsory for both bachelor and master study program Applied Informatics in full-time and distance form of study as well as bachelor and master study program Teaching of academic subjects in full-time and distance form of study. This electronic course is designed to use linear and branched teaching programs. In compiling the course we tried to take into consideration target audience - students of Computer Science. The course is designed to not require any special knowledge in IT field. Discrete Mathematics Course 1 consists of 10 thematic units (areas) replicating the length of the semester in weeks. Authors describe detail analysis of students behaviour which is made of data taken from LMS MOODLE database. We used specific types of data, which are indicating user traffic on every single page of the course. We used a log file that contains records of e-learning course with 107 students. To identify sessions, we used the STT (Session Timeout Threshold). Purpose of session identification is to divide access of all users into separate sessions (relations). Session side-effect may exclude users who are behind a NAT or proxy device. So we can identify users who are sharing a single computer, for example in a library. Students who used the e-course of Discrete Mathematics 1 were more successful in the final examination. The fact that the course is effective does not mean that all activities have been fully utilized. Based on the results of our analysis, we can optimize and improve the e-course and bring it closer to the student's needs. After implementation of necessary changes we can evaluate impact of these changes in the efficacy of the course.","","978-1-4799-7740-6","10.1109/ICETA.2014.7107621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7107621","","Mathematics;Electronic learning;Data mining;Informatics;Aggregates;Computer science","","3","","13","IEEE","14 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the implementation of integrated study programs by means of e-Learning systems requires the solution of several technical difficulties generated by the heterogeneity of systems. In order to identify the variables, rules and components that should be taken into account in our proposal, we have analyzed several collaboration agreements between universities at national, European and international levels as well as e-Learning frameworks.

These include (but are not limited to) limited reach; need for physical contact; and a high cost of acquisition of materials. The advent of the internet and telecommunication has offered a better and faster means of reaching target audience. Open Access and Open Education Resources (OER) platforms offer an even greater amount of access, devoid of the restrictions of the traditional pedagogical approach and the high cost of acquisition of knowledge available through the internet. However, the engagement and sustenance of OA systems require heavy initial nonrecurring engineering (NRE) and capital expenditure (CAPEX) in the related ICTs and network systems. In the past three years, since adopting an Open Access system, Covenant University (CU) has made several changes to its policies on research results dissemination and pedagogy, as well as the acquisition of relevant ICT facilities and procurement of requisite bandwidth to support these changes. Covenant University has invested massively in the upgrade of its OA development infrastructure amongst several other such as; network systems and upgrade of the University network backbone to sustain a high-grade 24/7, ubiquitous internet access. In addition, it has, adopted web-based information dissemination systems and E-learning platforms such as Moodle™ establish several teleconferencing/video conferencing centres and smart classrooms as well as deploy anti-plagiarism tools like Turnitin™. OA platforms and OERs offer avenues for improved teaching, learning and research at minimal cost to faculty and students. However, the cost of setting up of such system is enormous, particularly for institutions in developing countries.

One solution intended to support STEM classes took the form of a classroom management system, such as DyKnow Vision™, which was different from a course management system (CMS), such as Moodle™. This may be because HTML editors on web-based CMSs do not easily allow both instructors and students to produce freehand scientific information such as equations, charts, and illustrations. However, classroom management systems require special devices such as Tablet PCs and force instructors to perform complex system operations. Moreover, in some cases these systems are not necessarily designed to accumulate learning activities for ABET or e-Portfolio. To support both writing by hand and the accumulation of learning activities in a class, the system proposed here, developed on the basis of the key concept of “No special devices in a class,” makes use of sheets of paper and digitizes the papers after the class so that they can be stored in a CMS. A multifunctional peripheral with a digital watermark enables this educational setting. Our demonstration experiment for three classes functioned well.

However, these environments require accurate representation of knowledge about learner to provide suitable guidance. Based on the behavior and performance, the traces of learners are captured and categorized to provide appropriate guidance in the learning environment. The learner networks in E-Learning environment are normally of prodigious, and it is quite difficult to give guidance to each. Thus learners are clustered using traces. When the number of users in the environment increases, scalability comes into an issue. The issue has been solved as organizing the data instances in a way, so that unsupervised clustering algorithm will able to create clusters for 'n' number of learners. The edges rather than nodes have been taken as data instances. The proposed ECC (Edge centric clustering), treats each edge as one data instance and the connected nodes are the corresponding features. The variance of K-means is applied over the extracted edges, to partition the edges into disjoint sets. This paper contributes to achieve scalable clustering using sparse dimensions. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for the data gathered from VPL integrated with Moodle in Java using Eclipse IDE. The result shows that the proposed approach can efficiently handle huge network while compared to K-means.","","978-1-4673-5758-6","10.1109/CICT.2013.6558276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558276","Data Mining;Scalable Clustering;Dimensions;E-Learning;Traces","Clustering algorithms;Electronic learning;Conferences;Data mining;Servers;Time complexity;Hidden Markov models","","1","","17","IEEE","15 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing e-Learning environments present some similarities and most educators need several tools to efficiently make use of e-Learning. For instance, if an educator is using a Moodle based application, he/she may need to use www.turnitin.com as an online tool for students to submit their work and have it authenticated against plagiarism. In this paper we provide an efficient and effective framework to provide e-Learning services using the automatic composition of basic e-Learning services that may exist already in different environments. The framework provides a uniform platform for multiple basic services, service composition and e-Learning services provisioning, all monitored by making use of policies at different levels.

The reason for this stems from the advantages of online examinations, such as effectiveness, objectiveness, and flexibility. However, creating valid and reliable examinations remains a challenge. Often used as a framework for educational assessments, bloom's taxonomy greatly influences the formulation of course outcomes and examination questions. An ideal examination should consist of set of well-aligned questions that extensively meet all the course outcomes and correspond to the different levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Moodle is a popular widespread open source Learning Management System (LMS) that can be used to create examination questions. However, it is lacking in its reporting mechanisms that enables the classification of various questions based on the course outcomes and Bloom's Taxonomy. The objective of this paper is to propose and describe a framework to integrate outcome-based assessment into LMS. This alignment is significant in order to ensure high quality examination assessment as well as to help teachers develop a balanced examination that encompasses all the course outcomes and different levels of Bloom's taxonomy.","","978-1-4799-8547-0","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237147","Online assessment;LMS;E-Assessment;outcome-based assessment;Blooms' Taxonomy","Least squares approximations;Taxonomy;Testing;Prototypes;Electronic learning","","1","","18","IEEE","3 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various studies have established that it is appropriate for learning in the areas of technology, natural sciences and skills. The arts and humanities are more reluctant to use the new technology, since it seems less naturally suited to their disciplines. Is it possible that the arts and humanities can not find such an approach effective, or does it require a mental change on the part of the of lecturers? We tested three different approaches to acquiring student feedback: (1) the traditional classroom lecture, (2) studying with documents from Moodle, and (3) studying with interactive multimedia learning materials. In our research (in the course The Basics of Philosophical Thought) we have discovered that students who are digital natives still perceive traditional classroom lectures as more useful in the sense of understanding the reading materials than the other two approaches. This was evident in the students' homework, grades and survey analysis but not in time management. Given assembled data, we suggest that the optimal approach would be to provide e-learning materials prior to the lectures because this would allow students to participate actively in the lectures. If we use online interactive multimedia learning materials, most students still require live communication, which is not always feasible when online learning is the whole method. The online multimedia study approach could therefore be effective in the analytical philosophy course, but it would require a huge mental change on the part of all stakeholders.","","978-9-5323-3082-3","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160364","online learning;humanities;educational method comparison;e-learning materials","Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Electronic learning;Art","","","","12","","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Like nature, that develops special strategies for the evolution of the species, it is possible to find the correct individual learning path, using one of the oldest Mother Nature mechanisms-evolutive genetic. Using tools like JAVA, XML (eXtensible Markup Language), an open source LMS (Learning Management System), i.e. Moodle, a standard as SCORM (Sharable Content Reference Model), all controlled by a GA (Genetic Algorithm), it is possible to achieve a flexible platform to help all the educational process actors.

The system developed taps this collective behavior of students on Moodle.dbit.in - a community based course management system. This will help to track and classify student interests and their relative strengths using Forums and the same will be analyzed to help students match their interests and strengths in their future endeavours.","","978-1-4799-8187-8","10.1109/ICTSD.2015.7095843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095843","Collective Behavior;Homophily;Sentiment Analysis;NLP;Web Service","Programming;Databases;Media;Natural language processing;Training;Connectors;Business","","","","17","IEEE","30 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we investigate the dynamic identification of such groups based on the generation of extended user profiles and the application of content-analysis features, provided by an external framework. Our approach extends common explicit user profiles with implicit extracted data reflecting each user interests and interactions with other users and with the system. In order to draw conclusions about the use of implicit groups as building blocks for web applications, we present a tool that allows an easy integration of the concept in web applications.

A notable exception has been the use of federation protocols -commonly used for sharing laboratories from one university to other-, for actually sharing laboratories from a remote laboratory system to a C/LMS. This approach opened new doors in the simplification of the process, since it did not require the remote laboratories to make any type of change. The focus of this contribution is to provide a solution to decrease the number of functionalities required for creating an integration by providing a software component that reuses them. As shown in the contribution, this component has been implemented and two remote laboratory management systems (which provide access to multiple remote laboratories) are already supported, and a third one is under development. In the C/LMS side, all the LMSs supporting IMS LTI are supported, and HTTP APIs are provided for being supported by other systems.

In this context, a gamified online Moodle Learning Management System was developed where fifty seven learners used it to learn ""Object Oriented Design Methodology"" course. These learners then answered two questionnaires about preferences on game elements and personality. Data gathered from the instruments was analyzed using the statistical ChiSquare test. The obtained results highlighted that the learner's personality can affect the attitude of preferring to use a particular game element.

For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.","","978-1-5386-3837-8","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102297","Adaptive framework;educational recommender system;zone of proximal development;generic adaptation framework","Adaptive systems;Adaptation models;Electronic learning;Learning management systems;Real-time systems","","21","","28","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regarding the fact that learners vary in different aspects, and these differences affect the quality and quantity of interactions between them, it is important to group learners in a way that they can effectively cooperate. When only one criterion is considered in forming learning groups, it is not very difficult to create the groups manually, but it becomes complicated when more conditions and criteria are considered. Hence, varieties of algorithms have been proposed in order to ease the group formation process. In this paper, a new mechanism for forming learning groups is introduced. The proposed mechanism is an iterative process based on a genetic algorithm. Our algorithm is flexible to the number and type of the attributes. For different contexts, different set of attributes can be used to form learning groups. In fact, the instructor has the facility to choose different set of attributes and rank them based on their impact on forming well-structured groups. In addition, the iterative nature of the group formation process has let us to tune the threshold fitness value used in our GA, after each iteration step. Furthermore, a novel method for evaluating peers and learners is presented in this paper. The designed method discussed in this paper can be integrated into any web-based learning environment that supports collaborative activities. Currently we have implemented it on MOODLE.","","978-1-4577-0726-1","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208612","web-based collaborative learning;learning group;group formation;heterogeneous groups;homogeneous groups;group evaluation;peer evaluation;learner evaluation","Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Collaborative work;Collaboration;Greedy algorithms;Heuristic algorithms","","20","","11","IEEE","31 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current practices in risk assessment mostly rely on high-level, generic guidance or the subjective judgements of experts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to risk assessment using historical data associated with a software project. Specifically, our approach identifies patterns of past events that caused project delays, and uses this knowledge to identify risks in the current state of the project. A set of risk factors characterizing “risky” software tasks (in the form of issues) were extracted from five open source projects: Apache, Duraspace, JBoss, Moodle, and Spring. In addition, we performed feature selection using a sparse logistic regression model to select risk factors with good discriminative power. Based on these risk factors, we built predictive models to predict if an issue will cause a project delay. Our predictive models are able to predict both the risk impact (i.e. the extend of the delay) and the likelihood of a risk occurring. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive models, achieving on average 48%-81% precision, 23%-90% recall, 29%-71% F-measure, and 70%-92% Area Under the ROC Curve. Our predictive models also have low error rates: 0.39-0.75 for Macro-averaged Mean Cost-Error and 0.7-1.2 for Macro-averaged Mean Absolute Error.","2160-1860","978-0-7695-5594-2","10.1109/MSR.2015.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180087","","Delays;Software;Predictive models;Springs;Logistics;Risk management;Feature extraction","","14","","65","IEEE","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have used JADE (Java Agent Development Environment) platform to launch, migrate, classify and retrieve the learning content based on the customized query by a peer learners in an virtual e-learning environment like MOODLE. In turn the agent collects the user query and migrates into different Learning Object Repository, (LOR), learn and interact with them and retrieves the Learning Objects(LO) along with its Learning Object Metadata (LOM). From the retrieved learning objects the learner applies the machine learning algorithm for the purpose of classifying the LO based on his usefulness/interestingness/learning objective and etc., The retrieval agent has been trained by the machine learning algorithms and then this trained agents now migrates into different such LORs applies the classification in that respective place and retrieves only the relevant and ranked learning objects to the learner based on the learners pre classification techniques and interest. The main drawback in the case of traditional Client-Server based learning environment, the learner client portal takes the query of the learner, and retrieves all the result set irrespective of usefulness/interestingness of the learner. Here the learner spent time to get the irrelevant or non interested content along with the required set itself. The bandwidth also used to the transfer such uninterested content is waste. These two drawbacks can be avoided or rectified through the mobile agent which posses the capability of classification based on feature subset selection techniques like Infogain, entropy and machine learning algorithm then migrates into the different LOR for collecting the relevant LO. As soon as it is once migrated into the LOR, it applies the machine learning algorithm first and then classifies the result to eliminate the non interested content not to be retrieved and transported to the learner side. The result of experiment using there different classifier, TF-IDF, Bayesian and Fuzzy classifier for the design and development of trained document classifier are Presented. The feature subset selection algorithm can be integrated with this to improve further accuracy of classifications.(future work).","","978-1-4577-0726-1","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208621","Intelligent tutor system;Multi agent;Ontology;e-Learning","Machine learning;Bayesian methods;Mobile agents;Machine learning algorithms;Electronic learning;Abstracts;Entropy","","14","","26","IEEE","31 May 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In its 2010 ""Top 10 Most Critical Web Applications Security Risks"", the OWASP reported that the prevalence of access control vulnerabilities in web applications increased compared to 2007. However, in contrast to SQL injection and cross-site scripting flaws, access control vulnerabilities comparatively received much less attention from the research community. This paper presents ACMA (Access Control Model Analyzer), a model checking-based tool for the detection of access control vulnerabilities in PHP applications. The core of ACMA uses a lightweight model checker to detect the privileges that are enforced at each statement of an application. Based on this information, ACMA can detect several types of access control vulnerabilities: from forced browsing vulnerabilities to faulty access controls. We show how, when compared to the state of the art, ACMA achieves advantageously comparable results with accelerations up to 890 times faster. Moreover, contrary to the state of the art, ACMA scales up to medium-large applications with large access control models, as shown by the analysis of Moodle, a 400,000+ LOC application counting more than 200 distinct privileges. Results show that ACMA is fast, precise and scalable making it a practical tool for the detection of access control vulnerabilities in real-world applications. A discussion about further extensions to ACMA is also presented.","2375-5369","978-0-7695-4891-3","10.1109/WCRE.2012.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385120","Static analysis;PHP;Security;Scalability;Access control","Access control;Automata;Context;Analytical models;Mathematical model","","13","","30","IEEE","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relative merits of face-to-face instruction versus e-learning, especially in Primary Education, are still an open research issue, though. Another challenge that Primary Education faces is the development of STEM thinking and STEM-friendly attitudes in pupils of early ages. An educational intervention that attempts to address both issues is designed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. Motivation and engagement of young pupils are sought through the gamification of the learning process. The present study investigates the feasibility and the efficiency of an asynchronous e-learning scenario involving an on-line game, for pupils of 10-11 years, in the 5'h grade of Primary School. A basic STEM subject, Computer Programming Principles, is selected as the learning material to be taught purely remotely, through the e-learning environment designed and developed in moodle, for the purposes of this research. The educational intervention provides data on the learning outcomes of the pupils and on the efficiency of the approach. Evaluation results verify both the feasibility and the efficiency of this approach.

In this paper, we have introduced the new parameters saved in Learning Management System(LMS) log files that are equivalent to learning approaches questionnaire. This research has been performed using40MSce-learning students on four different courses and in three phases(stages)at Tarbiat Modares University. The results derived from the questionnaire were acquired according to the learners' learning style in the first phase and in the second one were derived on Bayesian Network(BN) approach. The results based on log file and network help were taken in the third phase. It is mentioned that the third results had the least uncertainty range due to BN approach. Finally equivalent parameters for each question and for each learning style dimension are introduced based on some applied LMS package such as Moodle and Sakai. The main points in this research are as below: learning style extraction based on all the learners' activities in LMS (in a day, in a course and in a semester) and not only based on his/her related activities. For instance, the results show that the learner is more active and general if he/she considers his/her other class mates's profile or add/complete (in forums) during exact time to study. These results can be applied in Personalized Intelligent Tutoring System(PITS) in e-learning environment and so in designing recommender system to increase learners' and tutors' satisfaction level.","2163-6982","978-1-4673-0957-8","10.1109/ICELET.2012.6333361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6333361","Learning Approach;Learning Management Systems(LMS);personalization;learner behavior;Intelligent Tutoring System(ITS)","Bayesian methods;Least squares approximation;Electronic learning;Educational institutions;Knowledge engineering;Uncertainty;Materials","","11","","16","IEEE","18 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the automatic modeling of learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students' Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior to those reported in the related literature.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8659191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8659191","","Learning management systems;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Adaptation models;Visualization;Machine learning","","11","","19","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, evaluation and measurement of user experience for LMS become crucial. There were some studies have been conducted to evaluate and measure an LMS product in to gain feedback from the user. However, the studies implement a partial view of LMS product. They have conducted researches that limited to comparing LMS and getting perception rather than observing the quality of the LMS. This paper proposed an evaluation and measurement of user experience (UX) for LMS by implementing user experience questionnaire tools. The study aims to get feedback, benchmark and identify UX while interacting with an LMS. The data are taken from 38 students who have experience using two LMS in a different semester. The first LMS based on Moodle was implemented in the first semester (LMS 1), on the other hand, the LMS using Schoology was applied in the second semester (LMS 2). As the results, LMS 1 and LMS 2 got the relative different impression in user perception. Similarly, they also achieved a different level of relative quality.

As a domain-specific remote laboratory, VISIR offers those features which are required for its stand-alone usage, such as authentication, scheduling, user management, etc. Though for certain purposes this may be adequate, often it is more appropriate to offer VISIR as one kind of experiment among many, under a generic remote laboratories framework, such as WebLab-Deusto, MIT iLabs or Labshare Sahara. These frameworks provide integrated access to several different kinds of experiments, such as electronics, robotics, etc. Through this integration, a smooth experience can be provided to the user, and VISIR can benefit from all the functionality that the generic framework provides (common authentication, load-balancing, scheduling, etc). Efforts are currently being made to integrate VISIR with various laboratories. In this paper, we describe what the integration of VISIR with Weblab-Deusto involves; how certain VISIR-specific functionalities that depended on its original framework were handled, and how through Weblab-Deusto VISIR can easily gain certain new features. Some of those are the integration with different environments such as Facebook, or with Learning Management Systems such as Moodle.

The analysis of open source community dynamics is a key capability in risk management practices focused on the integration of FLOSS in all types of organizations. We are conducting research in developing methodologies for managing risks of FLOSS adoption and deployment in various application domains. This paper is about the ability to systematically capture, filter, analyze, reason about, and build theories upon, the behavior of an open source community in combination with the structured elicitation of expert opinions on potential organizational business risk. The novel methodology presented here blends together qualitative and quantitative information as part of a wider analytics platform. The approach combines big data analytics with automatic scripting of scenarios that permits experts to assess risk indicators and business risks in focused tactical and strategic workshops. These workshops generate data that is used to construct Bayesian networks that map data from community risk drivers into statistical distributions that are feeding the platform risk management dashboard. A special feature of this model is that the dynamics of an open source community are tracked using social network metrics that capture the structure of unstructured chat data. The method is illustrated with a running example based on experience gained in implementing our approach in an academic smart environment setting including Mood bile, a Mobile Learning for Moodle (www.moodbile.org). This example is the first in a series of planned experiences in the domain of smart environments with the ultimate goal of deriving a complete risk model in that field.","0730-3157","978-1-4799-3575-8","10.1109/COMPSAC.2014.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899215","Free Libre Open Source Software;FLOSS;OSS;risk management;Bayesian networks;social network analysis;smart environment;smart device;mobile technologies;Moodbile","Communities;Ecosystems;Organizations;Mobile communication;Risk management;Bayes methods","","8","","23","IEEE","22 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Laboratory activities are not well integrated in this scenario yet, remaining mostly face to face. The ability to design, implement, use and evaluate effective learning objects to support online laboratories is essential to prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technicians.

Satisfactory user experience and personalized services require a quantitative and qualitative analysis of students' daily action in learning environments. The increasing adoption of Learning Analytics (LA) and Educational Data Mining (EDM) push the development of novel approaches and advancements in education sector. At the same time, the rapid disclosure of hidden knowledge and the immediate presentation of results to optimize personalized decision making is a challenge for the competitiveness of distance learning. The objective of this study is the analysis of processes, technologies and resources used in an annual module at the Hellenic Open University to provide stakeholders with the visibility of interactions and hidden value in students' interactions. LA technologies are used on large set of data that has been collected by a Moodle platform and carefully analyzed. Students' logins, replies and quizzes are blended with the average grade of the main written exercises during the academic year.

Based on WisCom; an instructional design model for developing online wisdom communities, this tutor mentor development program which utilized a blended format of face-to-face and online activities in MOODLE, attempted to build a learning community between trainees, both academics and professionals who represented diverse disciplines and organizations. A regression model examined predictors of learner satisfaction, using four independent variables: Community Building, Interaction, Course Design, and Learner Support. Interaction emerged as a strong predictor of Learner Satisfaction explaining 50.2% of the variance in Learner Satisfaction. This finding shows the importance of designing interactive learning activities to support learning online, and contradicts the general belief that Sri Lankan participants would be less likely to interact online because they come from a traditional education system that encourages passivity and reception of ideas from a more learned teacher. Qualitative analysis showed evidence of several types of learning online as a result of collaborative group interaction, as well as issues that contributed to non-participation. Factors that motivated participants to stay engaged in learning could be classified into three categories: (1) general enjoyment, interest and motivation; (2) collaborative learning and community building; and (3) knowledge building. These results suggest that the online learning design based on WisCom led to learner satisfaction and supported interaction and collaborative learning in the Sri Lankan socio-cultural context.","","978-1-4673-5530-8","10.1109/ICTer.2012.6421413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6421413","Online learning communities;collaborative learning;e-mentoring;inquiry-based learning;Sri Lanka;National Distance Education Systems;faculty development","Communities;Education;Context;Indexes;Buildings","","5","","21","IEEE","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the execution of the project, regular meetings were held, supported by an electronic environment. The environment LMS Moodle served as means of material distribution, exercise assigning, testing, but also to gain feedback. While the project was successfully completed in 2011, as participants, we were interested in whether the graduates of this type of studies further use the obtained materials in their practice, whether they apply gained experience and knowledge, whether they have in any way innovated their way of teaching. We acquired the needed information from the graduates of the learning by a survey conducted in January - March 2012 using the method of a questionnaire.

As a communications tool social media has vast and varied potential and capabilities. That potential should also be unlocked in the educational space. The social media platforms of Facebook and Twitter were used in undergraduate units at Qatar University (Doha, Qatar) and Macquarie university (Sydney, Australia) as a means to engage students. Social media was used to disseminate course announcements into the social media space and encourage students to more fully participate in all aspects of the learning experience. The main online portals for LAWC 217 (QU) remained Blackboard and for BUSL250 (MQ) it remained iLearn (moodle). Social media was used in a supporting manner in both contexts. The response from students at Qatar university was strong in relation to twitter in comparison with the utilisation of Twitter by students at Macquarie university. This difference raised important pedagogical questions as well as considerations in relation to the institutional infrastructre in place at both institutions. Qatar University is developing its social media strategy for online teaching. It has a policy framework in place but it is not widely disseminated among the faculty. By comparison Macquarie University has a strong social media presence, a robust guidelines and policy framework and a managerial predisposition to supporting and educating the faculty regarding these types of innovation. Three main points emerge from this comparison and require further research. 1. This preliminary comparison shows that cultural differences may contribute to the type of social media platforms students will engage in. What is the nature of this correlation and how can it be accounted for?2. Institutional differences in relation to policy and strategic support for the use of social media exist across institutions. To what extent does institutional support help of hinder the greater use of social media in unit delivery? 3. At both institutions, students were unaware how pervasisve their social media presence was and sometimes used the medium in an unproffessional or questionable manner. Is there scope for enhancing student proffessionalism in preparation for their 'working life' through the use of social media?","","978-1-4673-9431-4","10.1109/ECONF.2015.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478250","Social media;Qatar;Australia;Law;Business;Best practice","Media;Twitter;Facebook;Guidelines;Business;Context;Electronic learning","","2","","7","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These environments have the potential to become a valuable resource to support educational communications and collaborations between faculty and students. In addition, due to the nature of the design of these environments which keeps track of faculty and student's online activities, HEIs are now also capable of routinely collecting vast quantities of online activity data from both users. Taking advantage of this data, however, is neither simple nor straightforward due to its massive volume and high rate of velocity. Based on experience, this makes it difficult for anyone to make meaningful sense and use of this data. This paper describes a proposal for mining action log data recorded in an online learning environment in the context of generating graphical representations that can be used to compare faculty and students level of activities at any stage of course progression. Initial analysis was carried out using log data obtained from several blended courses dispensed in one University using a Moodle platform. Results indicate a strong indication that the approach can be used to reveal variations in behavioral aspects of students in terms of patterns in resource access, assessment tasks, and degree of engagement. It also shows that these variations are greatly influenced by how faculty utilizes the tools available within the environment.

Since its inception in 2009, the project has provided training to about 120,000 teachers from more than 4060 institutions spread across the country across three phases. The project utilizes a blended format in which live lectures are transmitted synchronously using the A-VIEW software and asynchronous interactions are facilitated in Moodle platform. In the current phase, the project utilizes IIT BombayX platform to provide Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) so as to include a wider spectrum of learners. In this work we look at the model used by the T10kT team and inspect the results from 15 Synchronous STTPs conducted to answer the following research questions: Do institutions registering with T10kT project prefer the distance mode of training? Do the learning activities within T10kT STTPs provide perception of learning and motivate participants to apply them? What are instructors' perceptions of T10kT based instruction in terms of modification in pedagogy and overall implementation? It is seen that 127 institutions have been recurrent participants and there has been four-fold increase in the number of participating institutions indicating the preference of this model. 92% of all the teachers who have participated in the phase II courses found the workshop experience to be highly beneficial and about 93% have indicated high positive intent to apply the workshop learning in their immediate practice. The feedback from the instructors indicate that transition from face-to-face to synchronous T10kT mode was not challenging and the instructors need to focus on learner centered practices for effective learning experience . A limitation that is seen with the current study is that it does not look into transfer of workshop learning in actual practice. However the project has started off blended MOOC models that will enable the administrators to look at student performance as well.","","978-1-5090-2504-6","10.1109/LaTiCE.2016.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7743158","Teacher Professional Development;Large-Scale;MOOC","Conferences;Training;Software;Tutorials;Engineering education;Government","","2","","17","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The well-designed learning outcomes are a key-factor in creating an efficient educational process, and, on the other hand, the dearth of such services is one of the main/common reasons for the failure of, most otherwise, well-established courses. The available LMSs, though, do not sufficiently support the learning outcomes creation. In this paper, the Learning Outcomes Authoring Tool (LOAT), a web based tool that comes to overcome this common addressed issue is presented, along with its architecture. The novelty of LOAT is that it applies emergent web technologies, initially designed for advanced web environments, to support (non-specialist) educators in creating effective learning courses. More over LOAT comes along with a number of pedagogical theories, organized as Taxonomies of Learning Domains. LOAT is designed so that it can be used as a standalone application or as a service into worldwide popular LMSs, such as Moodle, LAMS etc.","","978-1-4244-8828-5","10.1109/INCOS.2010.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702081","learning management system;intelligent tutoring tool;learning outcomes;learning taxonomies","Taxonomy;Databases;Education;Artificial intelligence;Least squares approximation;Face;Navigation","","1","","25","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As expected, a software market of auxiliary applications for these platforms has also emerged. One of the challenges these auxiliary applications must face is how to deal with the variability inherent to these different but similar platforms. Thus, we strongly believe the use of Software Product Line engineering techniques, whose goal is the effective production of similar software systems, can be greatly beneficial in this particular market segment. We demonstrate this idea by means of refactoring a data mining application, called ElWM (E-learning Web Miner), which works on e-learning platforms into a Software Product Line. We discuss the benefits obtained.","","978-84-939814-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403212","","Electronic learning;Data mining;Computer architecture;HTML;Software systems;Educational institutions","","1","","15","","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Text classification and sentiment analysis techniques have become a popular approach to determine user attitudes, emotions and experiences within business and social science domains. Initial research has begun to explore the application of text classification to students' written text to investigate how students experience learning processes. In this paper, we build on this emerging field, and apply text classification to forum text to determine if we can correctly notify lecturers when a student is experiencing difficulties with their Computer Science studies.

Whereas Moodle and Blackboard are used in more than 60% of top HEIs, the individual international regions do not necessarily bear the percentages of the overall total. An examination of LMSs most used reflects gaps in optimality in course delivery within online learning. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative which was established to standardize and modernize training and education management and delivery, developed and recommended usage of Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 and later versions. SCORM 2004 which provides for flexibility in sequencing and navigation for learner-centric course delivery is not supported in any version of the more prevalently used LMSs. It is believed that most learners have a preferred way in processing information. The research proposes codifying one or more Learning Style Instruments (LSIs), diagnosing a batch of learners for their dominant/existing learning styles and comparing these to preferred teaching approach(es) and then seek to provide course delivery as a best-fit per learner. As a proof of concept, OLeCenT has been developed. OLeCenT is a tool that allows the input of one or more course learning paths with real-time learning and automatically reconfigures the course path when a new trend or pattern is identified by significant but consistent variances in learning paths. OLeCenT identified disparity in teaching-learning and provided a mechanism towards improving online learner-centric course delivery.","","978-1-5090-4171-8","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821638","Learning Management Systems;course delivery;learner-centric","Learning management systems;Instruments;Training;Sequential analysis;Large scale integration","","1","","49","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lecturers are located on each of the campuses and it is their role to oversee the cohort of on-campus students on that particular campus. On-campus, full-time students are traditionally secondary students who have continued with their studies into tertiary education or mature learners who have been in the workforce for some time and return to study to re-skill, up-skill or update their knowledge and skill base. While students who study by a part-time, external (ie. flexible or distance) study mode are practitioners who have a trade qualification or are university graduates wishing to re-skill, up-skill or update their knowledge and skill base and continue working throughout their study. All students have access to course materials, video-streams of lectures, student-student and student-lecturer communication channels via a dedicated course Moodle™ website.","2377-634X","978-1-61284-469-5","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142747","distance education;materials science;lecturer-centric;residential schools","Educational institutions;Materials;Laboratories;Australia;Cities and towns;Conferences","","","","12","IEEE","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"B-learning solutions in higher education: Students' perceptions about an online environment","D. Martinho; I.

An learning environment, supported on two communication platforms - Moodle for asynchronous interaction and Cisco WebEx for synchronous interaction - was developed for two Information Systems first cycle classes; the institution had no previous experience of eLearning solutions and the course was based on student centred methodologies. A research on the critical factors of a b-learning solution was carried out through a survey. The results indicate that the students have positive perceptions about the online learning environment. There was a strong correlation between the variables related to the learning environment and feedback, interaction, time management and readiness for online learning. A preponderant majority of students (83.3%) indicated that, in the future, they would be willing to opt for a b-learning instructional solution. The research will develop by using a larger students' sample and by surveying the faculty perceptions on the development of eLearning methodologies, in order to provide the most suitable learning methodologies to the institution's development.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263196","b-learning;collaboration;instructional design;interaction;learning environment","Correlation;Internet;Electronic learning;Information services;Electronic publishing;Electronic mail;Software","","","","25","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But laboratory equipment can be expensive and students cannot take it with them to use it everywhere and at any time like a laptop computer or tablet. MoMoViLab provides a cloud solution for this issue by transferring experiments from the laboratory into a web browser. It follows the three principles of easy usability, modularity and scalability. MoMoViLab is designed to collaborate with common learning platforms like Moodle [1] or ILIAS [2]. The user interface only provides the functionality which is needed to carry out a specific experiment. Simulations are server-based, therefore no software has to be installed on students’ devices and performance requirements are kept low. New graphical display elements, editors and simulation software can easily be included into the system. Due to its modularity, multiple instances of simulation servers can run on different (virtual) machines in a cloud infrastructure to be able to handle highly changing demands. MoMoViLab can start or shut down virtual machines automatically, depending on the current or estimated future workload.","","978-1-5386-9114-4","10.1109/EWME.2018.8629489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629489","","Cloud computing;Integrated circuit modeling;Web servers;Linear systems;Browsers;Virtual machining","","","","14","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study utilized an experimental study design in which sampled students were divided into two groups: control and treatment. The treatment group was facilitated and supported to ensure that all the content was available and accessible on a Learning Management System (LMS). The lesson module of MOODLE LMS was utilized to ensure weekly release of content. Navigation to the following week's content was conditioned on accumulated score based on learners' responses to presentation-related questions which appeared on every page. From the analysis of project results and particularly the performance of the students, it is demonstrated that m-learning addressed the alarming cramming problem of examinations. In addition, m-learning allowed for location shifting with students able to learn from diverse physical locations using different portable gadgets, time shifting with students being able to access course materials anytime and on demand as well as interactivity with students being able to track their learning progress as well as the management of the learning environment with ability to provide online assessments, assignments, goals and expectations. Continuous interaction with the learning materials ensured that the learner was always ready for learning evaluation. The significant differences in CAT marks and overall examination score is a major finding that leads to the conclusion that m-learning is superior to the face-to-face mode because besides passing examinations, the learner is able to master content as the semester progresses. With the current trends in adoption m-learning, learning institutions can use the results of this study to implement effective Technology supported Distance Learning programmes.","","978-1-905824-38-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701732","Mobility;Control and Treatment;Learning Management System;T-test;m-learning","Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Least squares approximations;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Portable computers;Internet","","","","9","","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ILE must afford tools to replace traditional means and the analysis of the learner's interactions with his interactive learning environment must fill this gap through the digital traces. Thereby, we propose in this article an approach of identification, analysis and interpretation of the traces allowing all the actors of the ILE (the learner included) to improve the experience of the learner, throughout its learning cycle. This approach is based on the modelization of the learner profile through the implementation of attributes and indicators at all levels of interactions, as well as iterative algorithms of unsupervised classification (clustering). In addition, it is based on the adaptation of the path according to the cluster of each learner based on association algorithms and a recommendation system. We will use the Massive Open MOOC and we will rely on the data sources offered by our MOOC `Back to English' (Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra, Morocco) deployed on the MOODLE platform to illustrate our modeling.","","978-1-5386-7328-7","10.1109/ISAECT.2018.8618761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8618761","MOOC*;ILE**;learners;ressources;path;traces analysis;indicators;unsupervised algorithm;clustering;recommendations system","Data models;Adaptation models;Videos;Tools;Mathematical model;Games;Machine learning algorithms","","","","26","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, they have limitations when it comes to assessing generic skills. In most of them, every activity is assessable but just with a simple grade and there is not a direct link between activities and generic skills. In this work we present two alternatives to solve this issue: an assisted method based on a Model-driven architecture approach and a Rest Web service that facilitates the assessment of generic skills. We apply both approaches to a case study consisting in a Moodle-based course where we assess the ability of plan and manage time of each student. Results show that the approaches are complementary, the Web service provides more detailed formative feedback, but the Model-driven approach seems more scalable for courses with a high number of students, where it is more difficult to assess their generic skills.","","978-1-4799-4428-6","10.1109/SIIE.2014.7017716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017716","model-driven architecture;learning analytics;generic skills assessment;learning management system;online learning;technological support in online education;Rest Web service","Least squares approximations;Educational institutions;Planning;Computer architecture;Service-oriented architecture;Context","","","","19","IEEE","22 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
