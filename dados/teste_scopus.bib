	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) rely heavily on lithium-ion battery packs as essential energy storage components. However, inconsistencies in cell characteristics and operating conditions can lead to imbalanced state of charge (SOC) levels, resulting in reduced capacity and accelerated degradation. This study presents an active cell balancing method optimized for both charging and discharging scenarios, aiming to equalize SOC across cells and improve overall pack performance. The proposed system includes two balancing strategies: a charging balance that redistributes excess charge from high-SOC cells to maximize capacity, and a discharging balance that addresses low-SOC cells to extend discharge duration. Experimental results confirm that this method effectively reduces SOC disparities, enhancing both charging and discharging capacities. Additionally, to accurately predict battery lifespan and remaining useful life (RUL), seven machine learning models are evaluated using R-squared (R2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Among these, k-nearest Neighbors and Random Forest models deliver the highest accuracy, achieving R2 values of 0.996 and above with low MAE, demonstrating strong predictive capability. The integration of active balancing and RUL prediction enables a feedback loop where balanced SOC levels promote battery health, and RUL predictions inform optimal balancing strategies. This comprehensive approach advances EV battery management, enhancing lifespan and reliability through proactive balancing and predictive insights. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Technology integration in education holds promise for sustainable education regarding access, inclusion and quality, referencing the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4. Nonetheless, attitudes toward technology have been identified in the literature as a precursor to technology uptake for technocentric pedagogy. While contemporary studies have investigated the attitude variable and its effects on students’ behavioural intentions toward technology integration, it has been done holistically without specificity in terms of attitudes toward particular technologies. How these various attitudes toward different technologies and online pedagogy relate among themselves, leading to the prediction of intention behaviour towards technology integration in secondary classrooms, is not fully known. Consequently, this study formulates a model that specifies how attitudes toward learning management systems, attitudes toward computers, attitudes toward the Internet, and attitudes toward online learning intricately influence each other in determining students’ behavioural intentions to integrate technology into their learning. The study adopted a quantitative approach based on a correlational survey design and elicited responses from a stratified proportionate and simple random sample of 386 secondary school students through a questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques. Results from the structural model analysis revealed that students’ attitudes toward learning management systems, the Internet, and online learning directly determine students’ behavioural intentions toward ICT integration in their learning. Moreover, attitudes toward the learning management system and the Internet predicted students’ attitudes toward online learning. Furthermore, attitudes toward computers determined both students’ attitudes toward learning management systems and the Internet. Overall, the specified model determined about 40% variance in explaining students’ attitudes and their intention behaviour towards ICT integration in their learning. These findings provide an essential foundation for policy and practice towards technology integration in secondary education. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Accurately estimating snow hydrology parameters, including snow coverage mapping and snow depth, plays a significant role in comprehending water resource dynamics, flood forecasting, and environmental management in regions influenced by snow cover. These parameters are critical for hydrological models that simulate snowmelt and runoff, which are essential for predicting water availability and managing water resources in snow-covered areas. Traditional methods for estimating these parameters often rely on manual measurements or simplistic models, which can be inadequate for capturing the complexity of snow-related processes. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging deep learning techniques for snow hydrology parameter estimation, offering the potential to overcome these limitations. This review paper comprehensively analyzes the current state, challenges, and future directions of image-based approaches in snow hydrology parameter estimation. By harnessing the power of automated methods, particularly deep learning, these approaches demonstrate the ability to capture intricate spatial and temporal relationships present in image data. A comparative analysis on image-based methods highlights the strengths of automated approaches, including scalability and accuracy. Integration of image sensors, such as satellite imagery and crowd-sourced data, is explored as a crucial component of snow hydrology parameter estimation. Various satellite image sources, including Sentinel 1-2, Landsat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are discussed in terms of their suitability for snow hydrological applications. Despite the promise of image-based approaches, challenges remain, including data availability, model interpretability, and transferability. The paper identifies future research directions, emphasizing the exploration of novel deep learning architectures and uncertainty quantification techniques to address these challenges. In conclusion, this review underscores the importance of image-based approaches for advancing snow hydrology parameter estimation. By addressing challenges and maximizing potential impact, these approaches have the potential to revolutionize snow hydrological modeling and environmental management. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The emergence of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) represents a significant evolution of the traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. While earlier IoT systems prioritized the integration of intelligent devices, the SIoT paradigm shifts the focus toward enabling social interaction and collaboration among connected entities. Within the SIoT, various nodes can autonomously establish social connections to access the desired services. Given the dynamic and decentralized nature of this open environment, effective trust management becomes crucial. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have made significant progress in enhancing trust computing within the SIoT ecosystem. However, challenges such as scalability, dynamic behavior, and device resource limitations continue to pose difficulties. This study introduces SATM-SIoT, a decentralized self-adaptive trust management model for SIoT that integrates the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) control loop. By adjusting thresholds based on perceived hostile behavior, this model effectively identifies malicious devices, enhancing adaptivity in trust management. To address resource limitations and ensure scalability, our model assigns trust evaluation tasks to Fog nodes, leveraging their distributed computational power. We utilize ML techniques, specifically multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to analyze device behavior and assess trustworthiness. Federated learning (FL) enhances local ML models, enabling collaborative learning and incremental updates based on new data to adapt to the dynamics of SIoT. The primary goal of SATM-SIoT is to improve overall trustworthiness and accurately detect malicious devices while tackling challenges related to scalability, dynamic behavior, and resource constraints. We conducted experiments on a simulated SIoT network to validate our model. The results show that SATM-SIoT effectively identifies almost all malicious devices in a SIoT network. Utilizing the FL technique and MAPE-K loop led to an average increase in Success Rate of 7% and 9%, respectively. © 2025},

This paper explores the usability and trustworthiness of an AI-driven CDSS designed to assist ophthalmologists in treating diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, we created a CDSS and evaluated its impact on efficiency, informedness, and user experience through task-based semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with 11 ophthalmologists. The usability of the CDSS was rated highly, with a SUS of 81.75. Additionally, results show that participants felt like the CDSS would improve their efficiency and informedness with one major aspect being integrating Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data into a single interface. Additionally, we explored aspects of the trustworthiness of AI components, specifically OCT segmentation, treatment recommendation, and visual acuity forecasting. Through thematic analysis, we identified key factors influencing trustworthiness and clinical adoption. Results show that a larger degree of abstraction from input to output of a model correlates with decreased trust. From our findings, we propose three guidelines for designing trustworthy CDSS.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {A major challenging issue related to the emerging mixed traffic flow system, composed of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), is the lack of adequate traffic control measures, especially in a large freeway corridor with multiple bottlenecks. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning exhibits significant advantages, such as fast response, high flexibility, strong adaptability, low computational burden, and collaborative optimization. These features enable it to achieve superior efficiency and robustness in handling dynamically changing traffic environments and large-scale traffic control problems. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Integrated Traffic Control (ITC) strategy based on an Improved Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IPMATD3) algorithm in the mixed traffic environment (abbreviated as IPMATD3-based ITC). Specifically, the proposed IPMATD3-based ITC approach seeks to coordinate multiple Ramp Metering (RM) and Variable Speed Limit (VSL) controllers along a freeway corridor, with the objectives of improving traffic mobility and efficiency, enhancing safety, and reducing emissions. The proposed method utilized a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm to learn the joint actions of all traffic controllers in a high-dimensional state and action spaces. A hybrid reward function is developed by synchronously considering the above objectives to optimize traffic control performance. Then, the rank-based prioritized experience replay mechanism is incorporated into the conventional MATD3 algorithm to improve learning efficiency. A real-world freeway corridor is selected to test the proposed control method. Moreover, its performance is compared with the several state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable control performance at a 10% CAV Penetration Rate (PR), effectively reducing the spatiotemporal extent of freeway traffic congestion. The proposed method outperforms other approaches in improving freeway traffic efficiency, mobility, safety, and environmental sustainability. Increasing the PR can improve the performance of various methods and benefit traffic operations. However, when the PR reaches higher levels, the marginal benefits of further increases become less pronounced. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Enforcing a trust management model in the broker-based negotiation context is identified as a foremost challenge. Creating such trust model is not a pure technical issue, but the technology should enhance the cloud service negotiation framework for improving the utility value and success rate between the bargaining participants (consumer, broker, and service provider) during their negotiation progression. In the existing negotiation frameworks, trusts were established using reputation, self-assessment, identity, evidence, and policy-based evaluation techniques for maximizing the negotiators (cloud participants) utility value and success rate. To further maximization, a Bayesian-based adaptive probabilistic trust management model is enforced in the future broker-based trusted cloud service negotiation framework. This adaptive model dynamically ranks the service provider agents by estimating the success rate, cooperation rate and honesty rate factors to effectively measure the trustworthiness among the participants. The measured trustworthiness value will be used by the broker agents for prioritization of trusted provider agents over the non-trusted provider agents which minimizes the bargaining conflict between the participants and enhance future bargaining progression. In addition, the proposed adaptive probabilistic trust management model formulates the sequence of bilateral negotiation process among the participants as a Bayesian learning process. Finally, the performance of the projected cloud-enabled e-commerce negotiation framework with Bayesian-based adaptive probabilistic trust management model is compared with the existing frameworks by validating under different levels of negotiation rounds. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Interactions between human societies and natural systems are vastly complex, posing notable challenges for effective conservation. Here, we apply social-ecological systems thinking, the adaptive cycle framework, and resilience principles to enhance understanding and management of human-wildlife relationships on African savannas. Human-wildlife relations on African savannas have evolved dramatically over the millennia, from subsistence hunting to colonists’ fenced-in wildlife preserves to the rise of community-based natural resource management models. Much research has emphasized the importance of all potential stakeholders, including local communities, to be involved in wildlife conservation decisions. Though community involvement has improved conservation dramatically, future management policies and actions will require continuous learning to quickly adapt to the ever-changing global environment and growing urbanization of the region. Endowed with some of the greatest biodiversity on earth living near such a fast-growing human population, adaptive thinking will be vital to conserve African savannas. This framework can be used to improve how conservationists manage human-wildlife interactions on African savannas, especially as novel variables arise, and disturbances continue to change the management paradigm's current capacity to respond to the system. © 2025 Elsevier GmbH},

In collaboration with an infrastructure developer, a dataset of 461 data points and 12 features describing subcontractors' inherent risks and safety assurance performance were collected. This paper showed that supervised learning improves recall by 21 % when compared with the Delphi method. This paper also highlights that changes in input features' distributions (or covariate shifts) across construction stages and projects can reduce the recall of the supervised learning model from 93 % to 50 %. Key academic and practical contributions include the analytics-based approaches to develop weights for measuring contractors' safety performance, and strategies to manage the impact of covariate shifts on accuracy of feature weights. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), an 3D printing technique being popular for rapidly fabricating polymeric prototypes as well as functional components with gradient structures such as scaffolds still faces significant hurdles in quality control and defect management. To overcome these limitations, a comprehensive approach has been proposed integrating advanced deep learning models with an Internet of Things (IoT) based quality control system. The research proposes a framework using Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model, engineered to identify and classify three high-impact FDM defects: warping, layer delamination, and gaps in raster lines. The model has been fine-tuned on a curated dataset of original images, enhanced through pre-processing techniques. The DeiT model combined with a proposed Weighted Classification Accuracy (WCA) approach achieves an accuracy of 99.3%. Furthermore, the response time of the entire system is calculated to be 0.1121 s, providing real time monitoring and control. The research represents a significant step towards intelligent and optimized manufacturing systems in the context of Industry 4.0, addressing current challenges in FDM printing while paving the way for more autonomous and efficient 3D printing processes in the future. © 2025},

This membrane biopatch is imperceptible, flexible, and reusable, providing ultimate user comfort while detecting high-fidelity electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, pulse rate, and blood oxygen saturation. A set of in vivo studies with human subjects demonstrates that the soft device has great skin-conformal contact and minimized motion artifacts, capturing clinical-quality data with different activities, even during sleep. The developed signal processing methods and deep-learning algorithms offer automated, real-time classification of driving drowsiness, stress conditions, and sleep quality.

	abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics under hydrological and hydrogeological conditions for the large endorheic river basins urgently need to implement spatiotemporal hydro-economic optimization for agricultural and environmental water demand. However, the current optimization lacks a comprehensive modeling framework that fully integrates the crop pattern with conjunctive use of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) and the consequent hydrological responses of river–lake-groundwater system. To address this challenge, a novel hydro-economic simulation–optimization framework was developed to alleviate the conflicts between agricultural and environmental sectors. The simulation model integrated a machine learning model namely kernel extreme learning machine with physically-based MODFLOW-NWT to significantly lower the huge computational burden. The optimization model based on the ɛ-MOMA algorithm was used to maximize net agricultural economic profit, GW and lake water storage by optimizing crop pattern, SW/GW irrigation and ecological water diversion. The framework was validated in the Yanqi Basin, an arid endorheic river basin with intensive agricultural expansion. The optimization results demonstrate that the net economic profit conflicts with the GW and lake water storage subject to water scarcity in the arid basin. The representative Pareto schemes including the extreme and compromising solutions are compared with the historical scheme to uncover the management implications. First, the net profit, the lowest lake level can be elevated by up to 14.7 % and 1.60 m, respectively, and the largest GW drawdown can be reduced by up to 3.83 m compared to the pre-optimized scheme. Second, the cash crop acreage dominates net profit and can be increased in the first two management periods to maximize agricultural economic objective. However, the schemes maximizing GW and lake water storage objective need to lower cash crop acreage and reduce irrigation water demand throughout the management period. Then, SW irrigation is largely elevated by collaboratively optimizing the ecological water diversion to significantly reduce GW irrigation in the last two management periods compared to the pre-optimized scheme. Therefore, it is of great importance for achieving the optimal trade-offs between agricultural and environmental water demand to implement conjunctive SW and GW management. Finally, the location-dependent crop pattern and water policy can be optimized to identify spatial adjustment with the preferred objectives in the different irrigation districts. Overall, these results advance our understanding of conjunctive water management and crop pattern regulation in the arid endorheic river basin, and testify the flexibility and usefulness of the hydro-economic optimization framework. © 2025},

This dataset provides valuable information for earth and environmental scientists, and water resource managers, enhancing our understanding of the water cycle. It also provides an important foundation for enhancing the study of baseflow contributions to extreme events such as droughts and floods.

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a crucial role in modern healthcare applications by sensing and communicating environmental and patient health data through wireless mediums. These networks enable real-time monitoring of patients, including the elderly and individuals with chronic conditions, offering significant benefits in surveillance and healthcare management. However, several challenges persist in implementing WSNs for healthcare. Real-time administration faces obstacles such as managing patients, medical infrastructure, and staff while ensuring timely treatment delivery. Moreover, accurately predicting diseases and providing precise treatment remains complex due to the diverse nature of medical data and the limitations of traditional systems. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach integrated with WSNs to address these challenges. The system employs deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to automate healthcare functions such as patient monitoring, infrastructure management, and disease prediction. The proposed model (DCNN-LSTM) analyzes diverse data types, including numeric, alphanumeric, images, signals, and video, to accurately identify abnormal conditions and predict diseases. The system also generates real-time alerts for medical personnel, ensuring timely intervention. The proposed framework was validated using NS2 simulation software to model the WSN architecture and sensor node communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the DCNN-LSTM models achieved a classification accuracy of 96 % with a loss rate of 0.08, showcasing significant improvements over traditional approaches.

Addressing this challenge, the artificial pancreas (AP) has emerged as a viable solution for the autonomous regulation of BGL through the continuous infusion of insulin. The proposed methodology employs a triadic approach to develop an intelligent closed-loop pancreatic system. First, a nonlinear controller, specifically the supertwisting sliding mode control (SSMC), is applied for the regulation of blood glucose. To enhance the quality and efficacy of the controller, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is then integrated to facilitate online updates of the SSMC coefficients. Finally, a sine–cosine algorithm (SCA) is formulated to optimize the hyperparameters of the DRL approach, addressing the challenges associated with the calibration of reinforcement learning algorithms. The developed system has been evaluated on six diabetic patients, involving various tests with differing BGL references, meal consumption, and the management of uncertainties. A comparative analysis with conventional methodologies further substantiates the superiority of the proposed SSMC-based DRL-SCA system, demonstrating an overall average superiority of approximately 61.13% in tracking performance compared to traditional control methods across various cases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

A novel South Australian Local Health Network (SALHN) Continuous Improvement Program (CIP009) has integrated a top-down model of executive-directed change initiatives, with a bottom-up approach of clinician designed interventions to address an organisational-wide goal of improved patient flow. This study evaluated the strengths and challenges of CIP009 implementation from the perspective of participants and deliverers. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in 2023/2024 to evaluate the implementation of CIP009 and 12 associated quality improvement projects. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with key stakeholders (executives, coaches and CIP009 fellows) and guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A document review and observations of CIP009 team meetings were also conducted. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis, then deductively mapped against the five CFIR domains. Results: Thirty-one participants were interviewed individually or in focus groups, two presentation days and six team meetings were observed, and 78 documents were reviewed. Seven key themes were identified highlighting key challenges and strengths of CIP009 implementation within the SALHN setting. These included four key strengths: the CIP framework and culture (the flexible framework, common language, training, and a culture of flattened hierarchy); the benefits of support from a dedicated, internal improvement Faculty (wrap around support from coaches); the advantages of an enthusiastic team member disposition and incentives (vested interests to enhance workflow and patient outcomes); and effective teams and team composition (teams comprised of senior clinician change agents). Three key challenges included: workforce and organisation-level challenges (individual workloads, workforce capacity, and data access); team cohesion, logistics and stakeholder engagement challenges (issues in the way teams worked together); and training and support shortcomings (the training course, and the top-down nature of CIP009). Conclusion: This evaluation identified that CIP009 was considered an effective multifaceted CQI program. The strengths of CIP009 support a learning health system (a data driven model, utilising systematic frameworks, with commitment from leadership, and a culture of continuous learning). Further integration of implementation science principles may support the program to overcome the key challenges identified. These findings will inform and guide improvement efforts within future iterations of CIP. © The Author(s) 2025.},

How to turn massive smart meter data into actionable knowledge will be the key point to limit water wastage and promote efficient and sustainable distribution. Although the collection of data worldwide is currently limited, the potential future impact of exploiting data-driven and machine learning methods is increasingly recognized in research and industry, as shown by many scientific works published in recent years. In particular, the interest in deep learning for smart water distribution systems is increasing, motivated by the ability to learn intricate patterns from big data. This work aims to provide an overview of the current research and identify challenges for future directions by conducting an application-oriented survey. Specifically, by analysing data characteristics and operational targets, we propose a new taxonomy that helps structure properly the macro-areas of water management into infrastructure analysis, demand analysis and water quality monitoring. Existing methods are discussed for each application under these three stages. In addition, we also discuss potential research directions, such as federated learning, incremental learning, probabilistic modeling and explainability and address broad issues like data availability and implications for privacy. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Audit and group feedback (A&F) is an instrument used to encourage healthcare professionals to improve the quality of care. Clinical practice was audited against a set of criteria and fed back to a group by a facilitator. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how physician group feedback sessions in nursing homes were conducted and to what extent they resulted in action planning. Methods: Fifteen group feedback sessions of the antibiotic A&F program within a nursing home network were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via the Framework Method for thematic analysis. The coding was performed using the existing Calgary A&F Framework and Cooke’s conceptual model of physician behaviors, and open inductive codes were added. Results: Elements of the conceptual model and the Calgary A&F Framework occurred within all group feedback sessions. The relationships within the group and with the facilitators were important elements when moving a group from interpreting the results to formulating action plans. Physician groups responded positively to the audit data, particularly if they were among the best performing. The data were met with doubt by physicians who did not recognize their own practice. When exploring potential reasons for lower guideline adherence, groups often considered data quality or external factors such as the choice of non-adherent treatment by locum staff. The degree of reflection on personal factors as explanations for low adherence and the extent to which groups identified learning and improvement opportunities varied: some groups were able to formulate action plans to address data problems and knowledge gaps, whereas others scheduled a follow-up meeting to develop action plans for treatment or prescribing practice changes. Conclusions: The facilitator was crucial in supporting the group in interpreting the results, steering the conversation towards sharing change cues, and helping the physician group in developing action plans. The degree of reflection and action planning varied by group. By implementing the lessons learned from this study, group feedback sessions can be refined, supporting participants in action planning. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the limitations of existing battery thermal management systems (BTMS) that typically use constant coolant velocities to regulate the temperature excursions. In real-world applications, the power drawn, thereby, heat generation from batteries is not constant due to varying vehicle speeds, influenced by traffic and terrain. Under such conditions, maintaining constant coolant velocities may lead to overcooling, resulting in wasted energy, or undercooling, which could trigger thermal runaway. To overcome these challenges, a Smart Thermal Management System (STMS) is developed in the present study to identify smart velocity profile of the coolant for a user given conditions: (i) C-rate profile with respect to state of charge, (ii) initial temperature of the system (Tint), (iii) inlet temperature of the coolant (Tinlet), and iv) maximum allowable temperature of the batteries (TSPT). As a part of STMS development, an integrated serpentine channel based cold plate geometry, sandwiched between two pouch-type Li-ion batteries (LIBs), is designed numerically. Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), 600 samples were generated in the respective ranges of input parameters, namely, C-rate (0.5 - 5), initial DoD (0 - 0.8), initial temperature of the system (15 - 35 °C), inlet temperature of the coolant (15 - 35 °C), velocity of the coolant (0.01 - 0.5 m/s), and final DoD (0.05 - 0.85). Numerical simulations are conducted on the considered geometry using the NTGK model available in ANSYS Fluent for these 600 samples and the corresponding maximum temperatures on LIBs (Tmax) are noted. The GPR model was trained on these parameters to predict maximum temperatures, enabling the identification of smart coolant velocity profiles for popular drive cycles under specified user conditions (Tint,Tinlet,andTSPT). In addition, the percentage of energy being saved with smart velocity profile over constant velocity profile is also calculated. As the developed STMS model seeks information from user (Tint,Tinlet,andTSPT) to calculate smart velocity profile, it can be considered robust, independent of battery chemistry and BTMS designs, and applicable for any geographic or climatic conditions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Quality supervision in general practice (GP) is critical for the progress and satisfaction of GP registrars and for attracting future rural GPs. However, there is limited research to inform the implementation of feedback systems for enhancing supervision by rural supervisors, and no published evidence specific to distance education where a remote supervisor may be in a different practice and supervising from afar. This study aimed to develop and explore the outcomes of an easy-to-administer, safe and constructive, registrar-to-supervisor feedback system for a distance (or remote) supervision model. Methods: Participatory action research involved the design of a standardised short-form questionnaire and an administration, data analysis and feedback process between registrars and supervisors. The questionnaire was administered each year between 16–20 weeks of the first year of registrar training within a 3–4-year rural and remote GP training program—the Remote Vocational Training Scheme (RVTS) (2020–2022). Participation in the project was voluntary. Registrars were asked 12 standardised questions about supervision over three domains: bond strength, task agreement and goal setting. Responses were summed by domain and evaluated using set criteria of high (> 80%), medium (51% to 79%) or low (50% or lower). High- and medium-level narrative feedback reports were provided to supervisors. Low domain scores were followed up by relevant internal staff to negotiate and resolve issues. Results: All 106 commencing registrars completed the questionnaire, of which n = 99/106 (93%) reported high performance related to the bond with their supervisor, n = 94/106 (89%) reported high performance on training tasks, and n = 53/106 (50%) reported medium or low performance for supervisor’s understanding the registrar goals. The majority of supervisors found the feedback useful. Ten registrars identified to be in need (9% of 106) were offered additional support. Conclusions: The system was found to be feasible, safe, and constructive for reviewing the quality of a distance supervision model for rural and remote registrars. It enabled prompt resolution of issues that would have otherwise been difficult to address and facilitated more open discussions about the quality of supervision. This process has been standardised within the RVTS. © The Author(s) 2025.},

However, investigating the design of efficient VRBSGs from an integrated perspective of social cognitive, self-determination, and cognitive load theories is crucial but under-addressed. Therefore, this study developed a VRBSG learning system to enhance students’ learning of retailing management in pet nutrition. Specifically, this study investigated the impact of technological and instructional support and how the VRBSG can affect students' psychological needs and cognitive load, improving their learning achievement. A total of 214 undergraduate students were recruited as research participants, and the data collected were analyzed using the partial least squares method. The results showed that the learning achievement of the experimental group playing the VRBSG improved significantly. Surprisingly, technological and instructional support did not significantly influence learning anxiety. The VRBSG design considered pet nutrition knowledge, the prompt of the VRBSG mechanism, and students’ successful feelings about the learning materials and content. This design can provide students with good feelings in a situated learning environment. These findings have significant implications for the use of VRBSGs in management education, particularly in the field of retailing management. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {In cloud data centers, precise resource prediction is a critical issue due to the dynamic environment, the presence of irrelevant data points, and the unpredictable nature of resource demand. An accurate prediction helps with resource management, cost planning, and improving cloud-related services, whereas an inaccurate prediction increases the budget because of unused and overused resources. The presence of dynamic and irrelevant data not only creates confusion in the model, resulting in inaccurate predictions, but also adds unnecessary complexity and cost to the entire process. To address these challenges, we propose an approach for multi-model methods that uses a sliding window method with an adjustable size to estimate important data points from the real trace. The current work conducts three experiments to assess the impact of unpredictable data and improve the models' performance for greater accuracy. Initially, we conducted the experiment on entire datasets, but this approach failed to produce accurate and efficient machine-learning models. The next fixed window technique provides activity recognition in real-time, making it suitable for applications that require immediate feedback or response. Finally, a novel Variable-Size Sliding Window (VSSW) is proposed that selects relevant data points that help to provide better performance. Additionally, a Model Selector Decision Support System (MSDSS) is designed for forecasting and optimizing resource demand. This system determines the best predictive model for a specific set of resources based on observations gathered over a defined time frame. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has improved the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by approximately 50.01% compared to the baseline method and approximately 31.75% compared to the fixed window size approach. Furthermore, the proposed model effectively addresses the challenge of predicting resource workloads in a dynamic environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

Artificial Intelligence and simulation techniques can complement such an educational practice. In this paper, we present GLARE-Edu, an innovative system in which AI knowledge-based methodologies and simulation are exploited to train learners “how to act” on patients based on the evidence-based best practices provided by clinical practice guidelines. GLARE-Edu is being developed by a multi-disciplinary team involving physicians and AI experts, within the AI-LEAP (LEArning Personalization of AI and with AI) Italian project. GLARE-Edu is domain-independent: it supports the acquisition of clinical guidelines and case studies in a computer format. Based on acquired guidelines (and case studies), it provides a series of educational facilities: (i) navigation, to navigate the structured representation of the guidelines provided by GLARE-Edu, (ii) automated simulation, to show learners how a guideline would suggest to act, step-by-step, on a specific case, and (iii) (self)verification, asking learners how they would treat a case, and comparing step-by-step the learner’s proposal with the suggestions of the proper guideline. In this paper, we describe GLARE-Edu architecture and general features, and we demonstrate our approach through a concrete application to the melanoma guideline and we propose a preliminary evaluation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Neuralgia and other neuropathic pain are difficult to treat owing to their complicated etiology and a wide variety of responses to treatment. The novel neuromodulation technology transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has intriguing implications in targeted non-invasive brain stimulation. Patient-specific variables and neurological processes must be better understood to enhance tFUS for personalized therapy. Methods: In this research, a Machine Learning based Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Personalized Model (ML-tFUSPM) has been proposed to treat neuralgia by combining tFUS with data mining for personalized therapy. Data mining algorithms can examine patient demographics, pain factors, imaging data, and therapy outcomes to uncover response patterns and treatment predictors. According to these results, tFUS may be tailored to each patient by targeting brain regions involved in pain perception and control.

	abstract = {Glacier-fed lakes serve as vital indicators of climate change, yet their temperature and water level dynamics are insufficiently studied, particularly in high-altitude basins. Examining these interactions is fundamental for the effective management of water resources in sensitive environments. This study investigates the interactions between air temperature (Ta), water temperature (Tw), and water level (WL) in the Blue Moon Lake Valley (BMLV), using advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques to address gaps in predicting these complex dynamics. We employed the Mann-Kendall test and statistical tests (F-test, t-test) to detect trends in Ta, Tw, and WL. Granger causality analysis explored directional relationships, while wavelet analysis captured variations across multiple timescales. Extreme value analysis assessed the influence of temperature extremes on WL. We compared the performance of machine learning models (GBM, XGB, DT, RF) and proposed a hybrid Quad-Meta (QM) model, which combines the strengths of these approaches, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Results indicated significant warming trends for Ta and Tw, with Ta increasing more rapidly, while WL exhibited stability. This indicates that hydrological factors may play a central role in moderating water levels. In terms of prediction, the QM model demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest RMSE (0.117 °C for Tw, 0.326 °C for Ta, and 0.002 m for WL) and the highest R2 values. We recommend continued global monitoring of Ta, Tw and WL in glacier-fed lakes and developing a hybrid QM model to enhance prediction accuracy in high altitude sensitive environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

In this work, a dynamic alarm monitoring approach with data-driven ellipsoidal threshold learning is proposed, and an unknown system is directly learned using noisy data without model identification. An ellipsoid-based normal operating zone of the system variable is iteratively predicted based on system dynamics, and is updated as an external approximation of the intersection of a predicted ellipsoid and a measurement-based ellipsoid with an event-triggering condition. Then, the dynamic alarm limits are calculated for each dimension of the output by an ellipsoid-based quadratic equation, and a projection strategy from output points to the predicted ellipsoids is designed to have two different solutions to the equation. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic alarm monitoring approach is illustrated by experimental results on the sensor fault and actuator fault detection of an ultrasonic motor with and without an event-triggering condition, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The adoption of robotics and automated solutions in life sciences R&D has accelerated in recent years, driven by the need to process increasing sample volumes, protect laboratory staff from hazardous substances, and manage financial pressures. Various automation systems, each with distinct levels of sample processing, transportation tasks, and data management, are available to meet specific application requirements, with liquid handling robots taking pivotal positions in these systems. However, current liquid handling robots, such as the Opentrons OT-2, lack integrated vision-based quality control, which limits their accuracy and reliability. This study presents an AI-driven computer vision model designed to enhance quality control in laboratory automation. By integrating the YOLOv8 object detection model with the OT-2, our model enables precise detection of pipette tips and liquid volumes, providing real-time feedback on errors, such as missing tips and incorrect liquid levels. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and accessibility, presenting an affordable solution for improving automation in academic and research laboratories. This closed-loop system transforms the OT-2 into a robust tool for automated laboratory tasks, making it an accessible and cost-effective approach for enhancing quality control in laboratory automation and addressing a critical gap in available tools for resource-limited settings. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Solid waste management in urban areas in Malaysia is a critical issue that requires immediate attention. Waste management in Malaysia will become even more complex and difficult in the future due to the tremendous growth of the economy, urban population, and consumption patterns. The primary issue in this situation is the growing amount of waste production, which is outpacing the growth in disposal capacity. The Malaysian government has introduced the Waste Separation at Source Initiative (SSI), which mandates the Malaysian community to sustainable waste management practices in their daily lives. However, most urban Malaysians are unaware of these environmentally friendly waste management practices, despite the government's numerous attempts. Therefore, how to motivate the Malaysian community to adopt sustainable waste management practices has been of concern. A variety of persuasive technologies (PT) applications have been developed within sustainable HCI to promote sustainable waste management. However, its effectiveness among the urban community in Malaysia remains unknown. Accordingly, to develop an effective persuasive application for sustainable waste management, this study attempts to investigate end-user perspectives on effective persuasive design principles based on the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model. In-depth interview sessions were conducted with seven (7) participants, aged 31 to 47 years residing in various regions in Klang Valley. During interview sessions, participants were presented with several user interfaces (UIs) of waste management applications showing how each persuasive design principle had been applied. Next, we conducted a thematic analysis of positive and negative reviews of end-users to identify effective persuasive design principles to encourage sustainable waste management. Our results uncover 20 positives, 3 negatives, and 5 mixed views (positive and negative) perceptions. The positive perceptions fall under the following categories: reduction, tailoring, personalization, self-monitoring, simulation, praise, rewards, reminders, liking, social role, trustworthiness, expertise, surface credibility, real-world feel, verifiability, social learning, normative influence, and cooperation principles. Some of the negative perceptions include rehearsal, similarity, and recognition principles. Meanwhile, tunnelling, suggestion, authority, third-party endorsement, competition, social comparison, and social facilitation principles with mixed views (positive and negative) perceptions. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

	abstract = {Background: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a collaborative patient-centred process for arriving at informed healthcare decisions. Decision coaching can help support SDM when combined with patient decision aids. As part of a meta-curriculum “Ready for SDM” for training different healthcare professionals in SDM, we developed and pilot-tested a new module designed to train nurses as decision coaches. The study assessed nurses' perceptions of a decision coach training module, focusing on its feasibility, acceptability and its role in developing decision coaching capabilities. Methods: We used a two-phase approach guided by the Knowledge-to-Action Framework. In the first phase, we developed a decision coach training module. The second phase involved preliminary testing, using a descriptive design with qualitative and quantitative methods. We recruited a convenience sample of participants from two hospitals. Participants completed questionnaires at the end of Part A (classroom training). The assessment was informed by Kirkpatrick’s first three levels of educational outcomes: reaction (acceptability), learning (self-reported attitudes, intentions and confidence) and behaviour (practical application of decision coaching). A post-hoc inquiry investigated low participation in Part B of the coach training. Qualitative data underwent content analysis and quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: The development resulted in a decision coach training comprising a Part A (6 h) on SDM and decision coaching fundamentals and a Part B (1 h) which involved practical application of decision coaching in the participants’ own practice (audio recorded) with self-appraisal and individualised feedback. In preliminary testing with 19 nurses from seven clinical departments, 90% of participants rated Part A as acceptable and relevant to practice. Only one nurse completed Part B due to reluctance to audio record coaching sessions. The most reported perceived barrier was time constraints. Key perceived facilitators identified were interprofessional collaboration, management support and additional practical training. Conclusion: Decision coach training was feasible to deliver in the classroom. Participants reported Part A as acceptable and relevant to their practice. The second part, including an audio recording component, proved unfeasible. Further research should explore alternative methods for skill assessment and feedback in clinical practice. The results from this study will inform further refinement of the Norwegian Ready for SDM meta-curriculum and implementation strategies, particularly regarding the practical training components.

	abstract = {The hybridization of multiple energy sources is crucial for electric vehicle applications to achieve the same level of performance as that of internal combustion engine vehicles. Accurate power flow control depends on knowing the internal resistance of the battery and ultracapacitor (UC) at various charge levels. Therefore, this work focuses on prediction of the internal resistance of these sources at varying charge states and discharge rates. The first objective of this work is to establish a relationship between the source's state of charge (SoC) and open circuit voltage using a machine learning regression-based optimized curve-fitting model. This technique uses an algorithm to learn patterns from experimental data that minimize fitting errors and avoid overfitting, guaranteeing precise and broadly applicable forecasts. Thus, this model increases forecast accuracy and enhances generalization for dynamic operating conditions. The second objective is the application of a hybridized approach of heuristic optimization and forgetting factor recursive least square method, known as optimized forgetting factor recursive least square (OFFRLS) for extracting the source's internal electrical parameter at varying SoC and discharge rate. The forgetting factor in FFRLS can be challenging to adjust and can lead to overfitting since it affects the trade-off between stability and adapting to new input. As a result, the forgetting factor of the FFRLS algorithm is optimized at each time instant using heuristic optimization. This method is used to characterize battery and UC with second order Thevenin equivalent circuit model, which strikes a balance between complexity and accuracy and can capture dynamic behavior. For real time parameter estimation, an artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model trained using Bayesian regularization is developed for accurate and time-efficient source parameter estimation. When compared to OFFRLS, the time consumption can be decreased by using the ANN model for real-time estimate. Calibration tests, open circuit voltage tests, and dynamic discharge tests are performed in the lab with battery and UC for this research. By contrasting the estimated and actual terminal voltages of the sources, OFFRLS's effectiveness is illustrated. The measured terminal voltage of the battery differed from the estimated voltage by less than 0.5 %. The ability of the ANN to predict the internal resistance without overfitting was demonstrated by the strong correlation coefficients between the training and test data. Therefore, the proposed dynamic battery and UC models could be effectively used in applications such as energy management systems in electric vehicles. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The consumption of electricity has been increasing significantly because of the rising population, the impacts of climate change, rapid urbanization, and the widespread adoption of electronic devices. Smart grids are essential for efficient energy management, integrating renewable resources, optimizing power systems, and addressing different power demands. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) enhances their effectiveness by disaggregating overall consumption into appliance-specific data, enabling precise monitoring and control. This paper presents the design and implementation of an IoT NILM system that incorporates a custom smart meter with a real-time event detection algorithm, a light IoT framework and an unsupervised learning approach for creating a self-adaptive dataset. Through RMS current and active/reactive power transient signals obtained from the event detection algorithm working in a real-world scenario, a 1D-CNN autoencoder model extracts characteristics from the time series and they are used to feed a K-means algorithm with auto K selection based on silhouette score. The clusters of the K-means achieved an accuracy of 99.22% in classification and became the dataset tailored for end users. For demonstrating the effectiveness and usability of the created dataset, a 1D-CNN classification model was implemented, achieving an accuracy of 98.53%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The performance of precast construction relies on efficient on-site planning and scheduling of precast components. However, existing research primarily addresses either assembly sequence planning or construction process scheduling. The interactions between these elements and the dynamic nature of construction environments are often overlooked. This paper presents a novel two-stage planning and scheduling methodology that leverages a multi-agent system (MAS) and deep learning to account for construction environment, crews, materials, equipment, and assembly sequencing. First, precast components within the construction area are categorized into groups based on their coupling states. A knowledge-enhanced graph transformer is then introduced to determine the assembly sequence of intra-group components, considering their physical attributes and topological relationships. Subsequently, the MAS is developed to orchestrate the sequence of inter-group construction activities, addressing factors such as site congestion, worker movements, and material consumption. The knowledge-enhanced graph transformer is integrated into the MAS as a smart agent, to facilitate coordination between intra-group and inter-group planning. Finally, an engineering case is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that, compared to conventional MAS methods, the group-based plan leads to a 3.1 % reduction in construction time, a 6–10 % decrease in crew walking distance, and effectively mitigates assembly difficulties. These outcomes provide construction managers with innovative strategies and perspectives for optimizing construction workflows. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into surgical practice necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of its applications, challenges, and physiological impact. This systematic review synthesizes current AI applications in surgery, with a particular focus on machine learning (ML) and its role in optimizing preoperative planning, intraoperative decision-making, and postoperative patient management. Using PRISMA guidelines and PICO criteria, we analyzed key studies addressing AI’s contributions to surgical precision, outcome prediction, and real-time physiological monitoring. While AI has demonstrated significant promise—from enhancing diagnostics to improving intraoperative safety—many surgeons remain skeptical due to concerns over algorithmic unpredictability, surgeon autonomy, and ethical transparency. This review explores AI’s physiological integration into surgery, discussing its role in real-time hemodynamic assessments, AI-guided tissue characterization, and intraoperative physiological modeling. Ethical concerns, including algorithmic opacity and liability in high-stakes scenarios, are critically examined alongside AI’s potential to augment surgical expertise. We conclude that longitudinal validation, improved AI explainability, and adaptive regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure safe, effective, and ethically sound integration of AI into surgical decision-making. Future research should focus on bridging AI-driven analytics with real-time physiological feedback to refine precision surgery and patient safety strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

Anomalies such as leaks, corrosion, and structural deformations can result in severe issues for the environment, economy, and public safety. Traditional inspection methods, such as manual visual inspection, magnetic flux leakage, and ultrasonic testing, face challenges such as high cost, labor intensity, and limited automation. Computer vision has emerged as a promising solution to overcome these limitations by enabling automated, efficient, and cost-effective anomaly detection in pipelines. This paper systematically reviews the application of computer vision techniques for pipeline inspection, including data collection, image processing, deep learning-based analysis, digital twin-based management. Key influencing factors, challenges, and opportunities are discussed. The findings reveal that, with appropriate preprocessing, deep learning models achieved high accuracy in detecting cracks, corrosion, deformation, and dents, but their generalization performance was dependent on dataset quality, quantity, and preprocessing techniques.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: This article delves into the current applications, challenges, and future directions of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare epidemiology, focusing on its integration into infection surveillance, prediction modelling, antimicrobial resistance, and antimicrobial stewardship. Recent Findings: AI has the potential to transform key areas in healthcare epidemiology. AI-driven systems improve infection surveillance by automating data collection and analysis, enabling real-time monitoring and rapid identification of infection trends and outbreaks. Predictive modeling benefits from AI through processing of big data and other unconventional data sources. AI can augment antimicrobial stewardship by individualizing antimicrobial therapy, reducing inappropriate use. Finally, AI aids in addressing antimicrobial resistance by facilitating rapid detection of resistance patterns, enhancing surveillance, and accelerating the discovery of new antibiotics. Together, these advancements promise more effective management of infectious diseases and optimized healthcare interventions. Summary: The role of AI in healthcare epidemiology is still getting defined but is showing a lot of potential in many areas. Ongoing challenges include data quality, ethical considerations, and the need for explainable AI models to ensure transparency and trust among healthcare professionals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

To address these issues, a proficiency-based grading approach was adopted, emphasizing clearly defined standards, growth-oriented feedback, progress-indicating marks, and penalty-free reassessment opportunities. Course assessments included weekly write-ups, movement analyses, and practical examinations, with flexible submission timelines and revision opportunities. Student feedback through microassessment revealed reduced stress levels, improved time management across courses, and deeper engagement with course material. Although implementation challenges existed, particularly around the initial faculty workload, the approach demonstrated significant learning gains while supporting student well-being. Our experience suggests that alternative grading strategies can maintain academic rigor while creating a more supportive and effective learning environment in science education.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article provides a practical implementation model for alternative grading in a science course, demonstrating how proficiency-based assessment can maintain academic rigor while reducing student stress.},

Entrustable professional activities (EPAs), case-based discussion, and structured in-training assessment activities were introduced as part of an initial WBA “toolkit” for intern pharmacist training in Australia. The study aimed to explore perspectives on the impact of WBA tools—comprising EPAs, case-based discussion, and in-training assessment activities—on intern learning, feedback provision, intern-preceptor relationships, and workload. Methods: Data were collected using 3 complementary approaches: (1) an anonymous cross-sectional survey of interns, pharmacist preceptors, and intern training program providers; (2) focus groups with pharmacy interns and/or pharmacist preceptors; and (3) structured interviews with pharmacists coordinating intern training. Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews were analyzed thematically, while survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 29 participants (interns: n = 13, pharmacists, n = 16) engaged across 9 focus groups. Ten pharmacists, equally distributed between community and hospital settings, were interviewed. A total of 510 individuals participated in the survey. Participants reported high satisfaction with the tools, highlighting 6 key themes: workplace learning, feedback, performance assessment, consistency in expectations, integration of reflective practices, and workload management. While these tools were well received and effectively used, managing the associated workload emerged as a challenge for interns and preceptors. Conclusion: The integration of WBA tools into pharmacy intern training enhanced feedback quality and supported workplace learning and performance assessment. Although these tools increase workload for learners and supervisors, their benefits and overall value outweighed the challenges. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction: People with intellectual disability (PwID) are 2% of the UK population. Constipation and bowel movement (BM) problems (diarrhoea/faecal incontinence etc.) affects over a third of PwID and is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality. Pw ID rely heavily on outside support (family/professional carers/healthcare professionals), many of whom are ignorant to bowel related harms. There is significant stigma to discuss BM particularly constipation. Serious Games (SG) are increasingly used for education of health needs. This review examines if game-based technology can assist improving knowledge and reducing stigma of BM problems particularly constipation. Objective: To identify and gain evidence of SGs aimed at improving knowledge of BM management particularly constipation. Methods: A systematic search of publications between 2010 and 2024 was conducted following the PRISMA ScR statement for scoping reviews. The search inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed and overseen by an information specialist. PUBMED, EMBASE and PsychINFO databases were searched. Extracted variables included SG title, co-production and expert involvement, target outcome, evaluation methodology, effectiveness, sustainability and game platform. Results were narratively synthesised. Results: Of 2966 papers retrieved, three were selected for inclusion, none RCTs. All three included SGs aimed to teach BM management or recognition to healthcare workers/ professionals. Two studies evaluated game efficacy. No SGs were assessed after initial trials, none were implemented in clinical practice. Only one game successfully improved participant knowledge. All game creators consulted experts during game design, but none consulted patients. None discussed reducing stigma amongst their audience. Conclusion: Only one of three SGs identified improved BM knowledge in healthcare workers/professionals and was not specific to PwID. There is potential to co-produce with PwID and their carers a SG to support BM problems particularly constipation to reduce stigma, improve outcomes and be a templar for other similarly vulnerable groups like those with dementia. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Climate change, volatile markets, and local resource variability pose significant challenges to sustainable agricultural development, particularly in soil health management. Despite extensive scientific research, the adoption of soil health solutions (SHS) among smallholder farmers in Africa remains low, highlighting a gap between research and practical implementation. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of farmer agency in enhancing the effectiveness of agricultural extension models, with a focus on soil health management. The paper aims to demonstrate how empowering farmers to innovate and adapt both local and scientific knowledge can lead to more efficient and sustainable agricultural systems. METHODS: This paper presents a review and perspective on the importance of farmer agency in sustainable soil management and agriculture extension more generally. It examines current limitations in research and extension systems, discusses the need for hyper-localisation of soil health practices, and proposes solutions for integrating farmer agency into agricultural development programmes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The review identifies several factors that enhance farmer agency, including education, economic opportunities, social networks, and supportive policies. It concludes that fostering farmer agency is crucial for improving soil health outcomes and driving sustainable agricultural transformation. The paper proposes guiding principles for policies and programmes aimed at elevating farmer decision-making power, including farmer-centred learning platforms, digital tools, and initiatives that strengthen social capital within farming communities. SIGNIFICANCE: This perspective highlights the critical role of farmer agency in bridging the gap between scientific research and practical implementation of sustainable soil management practices. By emphasising the importance of empowering farmers as autonomous decision-makers, the paper provides a framework for more effective agricultural extension and development programming. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the adoption and adaptation of SHS, leading to more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems in Africa. © 2025},

To boost teachers' workflow efficiency, we present an innovative knowledge management tool that allows experienced teachers to seamlessly capture task steps (i.e., denoted as ShareFlow) that can be subsequently recommended to novices via proactive push, all happening during teachers' natural workflow to minimize disruptions. We conducted a controlled experiment with 30 participants and compared our tool against a state-of-the-art baseline knowledge management system powered by a large language model (Claude 3 Haiku). We found that our knowledge management tool reduced task completion time and improved task quality (with statistical significance).

	abstract = {Bidirectional Feedback may benefit students by facilitating learning success and goal achievement and can help teachers address students’ needs and/or assess and improve learning material. Current feedback practices have limitations, such as the difficulty for students to formulate understandable feedback for teachers, the effort required for students and teachers to engage in feedback dialogue, and the challenge for teachers to manage multiple feedback responses across a wide range of learning material. Thus, there is a need for computational support in a digital learning environment that facilitates bidirectional feedback creation, processing, and dialogue. To this end, we present a process model of bidirectional feedback, a conceptual design of a computational support to assist this process, and its implementation for the self-assessment task type in Moodle. It was implemented and evaluated in a distance learning course in a B.Sc. Computer Science program. With the use of computer-assisted support for the bidirectional feedback process, an increase in feedback from more students was observed and was related to more self-assessment tasks. Feedback included not only negative but also positive feedback. Teachers confirmed the usefulness of computational support as well as the usefulness and understandability of student-generated feedback messages, both for helping students and for assessing and improving the quality of assignments. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting is critical for effective smart grid management. However, PV power is highly dependent on weather variables, resulting in significant volatility and nonlinearity in generation patterns, which makes traditional forecasting methods often struggle to guarantee both accuracy and robustness at the same time. Although Pareto-front-based ensemble learning approaches partially mitigate these issues, the excessive generation of suboptimal solutions increases decision-making challenges for grid operators. To this end, this paper customizes a novel PV ensemble learning forecasting system based on Bi-Directional Guarantee (BIDG) and Pareto Front Shrinking (PFS). Specifically, the original Hippopotamus Optimizer (HO) is enhanced into a Multi-Objective Hippopotamus Optimizer (MOHO) using a crowding-distance-based multi-objective framework. To further enhance the algorithm's performance, low-discrepancy sequence initialization is adopted to improve the optimizer's exploration ability, and a perturbation operator is introduced to enhance convergence performance. The BIDG mechanism based on the improved MOHO is used as the weighting strategy for ensemble learning, which imposes dual constraints on the accuracy and robustness of the forecast and penalizes suboptimal solutions to improve the quality of the Pareto front. To further improve the quality of the Pareto front to simplify decision-making, we combine the Shrinking Method to Quantify Competition (SMQC) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to shrink the Pareto front. Numerical validation is conducted using seasonal local datasets from a PV plant in Australia's Northern Territory. The experimental results show that the average absolute percentage error of the hybrid framework on the four datasets are MAESpring = 0.3518, MAESummer = 0.5689, MAEAutumn = 0.8585, MAEWinter = 1.2175, which are significantly lower than other models, achieving higher forecasting accuracy and demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world smart grid operations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The marine economy is widely considered the next frontier of economic growth and will make significant contributions to the overall economy of many countries. However, fluctuations in the development of the marine economy intensify the focus on risk management, thereby driving the pursuit of greater resilience. Through a thorough analysis of conceptual evolution of resilience, an evaluative framework has been developed, encompassing four aspects across which resilience is manifested and fourteen indicators selected from the economic, social, and ecological systems. Furthermore, marine economic resilience was calculated for China using the Critic-Topsis method and analyzed from the overall, temporal, and spatial perspectives. Then the relationship between spatial structure and the enhancement of resilience was investigated. The findings are as follows: (1) Marine economic resilience across all provinces and municipalities has been improving over time in China; Shandong Province and Guangdong Province stand out as particularly prominent examples in terms of their performance. (2) The updating and progressing aspect of marine economic resilience plays an increasingly pivotal role in the system's ability to respond to shocks. Advances in marine scientific research and the expansion of talent reserves bolster the learning ability to derive insights from such shocks, facilitating the system's resilience. (3) There are significant variations in marine economic resilience across different marine economic circles and among provinces within each circle, and spatial imbalances and lack of coordination can affect the overall improvement of marine economic resilience. An optimal spatial structure that promotes resilience features an appropriate degree of multicentricity. Therefore, to boost the development of marine economy, the enhancement of resilience should be a continuous focus, and the updating and progressing aspect of marine economic resilience supported by learning capabilities are crucial. It is also critical for coastal areas to strengthen cooperation to promote the overall marine economic resilience. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Recently, numerous initiatives have been taken to improve food and meals for hospital inpatients. Research providing in-depth knowledge on leading such improvement initiatives and implementing changes, specifically through facilitation within this multilevel context, is essential. This study aims to explore nutrition leaders’ experiences in implementing changes to improve food and meal provision for hospital inpatients, focusing on facilitation activities. Method: This is a qualitative interview study within the social constructivist paradigm. Participants were recruited through professional networks, advertisements, and snowballing. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with participants in leadership roles of food and meal improvement initiatives at Swedish hospitals. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically through an i-PARIHS lens. Results: Three themes of facilitation activities were identified: ‘Building Relationships’, ‘Placing Food and Meals on the Agenda’, and ‘Cultivating Skills’. Building relationships involved establishing connections between the service and clinical divisions. Creating common structures and multidisciplinary teamwork enabled collaboration across organisational boundaries. Placing food and meals on the agenda involved both initial and ongoing communication activities, as food and meal tasks were often considered low priority. Cultivating skills encompassed creating learning opportunities for implementing lasting changes, tailored to specific contexts and adopted within everyday practices. Conclusions: Collaboration between foodservice and clinical professionals, along with the dissemination of knowledge, appears to be important for implementing changes. Active leadership supports successful implementations by providing structured approaches, including feedback systems, and by contributing to the recognition of improvement initiatives, according to experiences shared during interviews. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical faculty development focused on Health Systems Science (HSS) is crucial for integrating HSS concepts into medical education. The 2021 HSSIP Faculty Development program was created to support faculty in effectively creating and incorporating comprehensive HSS content into the clerkship experience. Methods: Nine clinical champions, selected for their diverse backgrounds and interest in HSS, participated from November 2021 through October 2022 in monthly day-long, in-person workshops, and bi-monthly self-directed sessions, covering both HSS domains and foundational learning in curriculum development. Using a community of practice model, clinical champions gained expertise in HSS domains and developed curricula throughout the year-long program. Evaluation methods included surveys and feedback, focusing on satisfaction, self-efficacy, and curricular content creation. Results: Post-engagement surveys showed increased comfort in teaching HSS content, with significant improvement in specific areas. Participants valued learning from experts and collaborating with peers but found virtual sessions challenging. Despite systemic challenges and time constraints, clinical champions successfully created and implemented HSS-focused curricular content. They also contributed to broader HSS education efforts, presenting scholarly work and integrating HSS into various educational activities. Conclusions: This study showcases an innovative approach to preparing faculty to integrate HSS into clinical education. Key lessons included the value of subject matter experts, community engagement, and the challenges of virtual participation. Despite limitations such as low response numbers and context-specific results, the program demonstrated the potential for broad HSS integration. Further research with more participants and more rigorous data collection protocols is needed to more fully understand the generalizability of such an innovation. The initiative serves as a model for other academic health centers. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Very-short-term power load forecasting (VSTLF) is essential for supporting government planning in the transformation and expansion of power grids, as well as in the formulation of sustainable green development strategies. The traditional hybrid VSTLF method utilises future information using the one-off data decomposition method. This causes information leakage and significantly reduced the practical applicability of model engineering. Although rolling decomposition solves these issues, the prediction model shows poor performance and inefficiency in its utilisation of annual power load data. This study proposes a flexible VSTLF framework for a multivariable rolling decomposition hybrid learning paradigm to overcome these deficiencies. Specifically, a real-time rolling decomposition module based on annual power load features is utilised to adaptively denoise and strengthen the learnability of the sequences; this approach avoids using future information and improves data utilisation efficiency. Then, the main forecasting module, which integrates the long short-term memory network, attention mechanism, and ensemble learning optimised by the multiobjective dung beetle optimiser, performs point and interval predictions. Experimental results from two real-world power load datasets from China and Spain demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 2 % for point predictions and high-quality average interval scores for interval predictions. Performance evaluations demonstrated that the proposed optimiser can effectively obtain solutions along the Pareto frontier, outperforming traditional optimisation algorithms in terms of both convergence and diversity. This accurate and stable VSTLF system is expected to improve the efficiency of power grid planning and support effective energy management policies. © 2025},

Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was applied. Learning from Excellence was implemented in a postanaesthesia care unit of a Norwegian university hospital between November 2022 and May 2023. Six semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted, from May to June 2023, with a convenience sample of nurses (n = 17) and physicians (n = 7). The data were analysed through inductive reflexive thematic analysis. The study adhered to the COREQ guidelines. Results: This study reports four prominent themes encapsulating healthcare professionals’ experiences with Learning from Excellence. These themes were termed as follows: 1) ‘Facilitates a more positive working climate’, including sub-themes ‘Helps spread positive feedback’ and ‘Feeling seen and motivated’; 2) ‘Why don’t I get any ‘likes’?’; 3) ‘Organisational learning is challenging’, including sub-themes ‘Hesitating to report’ and ‘Provides mostly superficial learning’; and 4) ‘Success inspires quality improvement project’. Conclusions: Implementing LfE mostly contributed to a positive working climate in a postanaesthesia care unit. For LfE to be worth implementing, it is essential to improve organisational learning, while minimising the negative effects of LfE, such as exclusivity issues.

	abstract = {Decisions related to education are complex and have long-term consequences. For higher education students, most of these decisions are made when students are young and with little academic experience; these decisions can potentially influence students to postpone the completion of academic tasks or make unwise decisions. In this research, an e-nudging model is proposed for higher education in Saudi Arabia (SA), offering early and low-cost support for universities to encourage students to make better. A mixed-methods approach (an explanatory sequential design) was adopted, and two online surveys were designed to target academics and IT staff. The survey of academics and IT staff yielded two new factors: training and support for both instructors and students and awareness of e-nudges. The students' survey showed that 45.30% of university students are struggling to maintain attention and 29.66% have issues with memory. The interview phase was conducted with twenty-five expert academics who were invited to give their perceptions about the e-nudging model, and two new factors were generated, namely “define students' barriers: behavior, cognitive and environmental” and “ethics of e-nudge”. The position of the evaluation stage in the e-nudging model was changed to make the purpose and functionality of this stage clearer to the readers. In the future, this research can be re-conducted in other developing countries, especially the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries which share many common characteristics such as culture, religion, social mores, languages, and economic and financial systems. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This study explores the critical role of artificial cognitive autonomy in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), focusing on scenarios where quick and safe decisions are imperative. We investigate a progressive autonomy strategy supported by advanced artificial cognition techniques to improve decision-making in unforeseen situations and in the face of unknown conditions. We highlight the importance of these systems in performing essential safety functions through a three-dimensional approach: advanced perception for detailed environmental analysis; decision making based on robust algorithms for logical assessment of risk scenarios; and precise action and control to perform essential autonomous tasks. Additionally, we present a conceptual modeling that illustrates the progression of autonomy levels from total dependence to completely autonomous operation, highlighting the evolution of HRI systems through artificial cognitive autonomy. This article argues that decision-making optimization in HRI can be significantly improved through a detailed and incremental understanding of autonomy. By adopting enabling technologies, we enable autonomous agents to not only evolve within their environments, but also learn, understand and fulfill their responsibilities effectively. This theoretical approach promotes a systematic evolution of autonomy, as well as ensuring that robotic systems adapt and respond appropriately to the complex and dynamic demands of the environments in which they operate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

Nevertheless, the nonlinearity and the time-varying property in the model of characteristics of fuel cell dynamics make transient power control challenging. This study employs a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to control transient power in fuel cells precisely. This approach combines the feedforward mechanism of prior knowledge with the feedback mechanism of critic–actor neural networks. It validates its effectiveness through a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell system and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. Experimental results from a real proton exchange membrane fuel cell system indicate that under rapidly changing load conditions, the proposed control strategy exhibits rapid dynamic response, precise steady-state tracking performance, and high robustness against unmodeled dynamics, effectively addressing complex dynamic response challenges. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a critical aspect of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), aimed at predicting the future state of a system to enable timely maintenance and prevent unexpected failures. While existing deep learning methods have shown promise, they often struggle to fully leverage the spatial information inherent in complex systems, limiting their effectiveness in RUL prediction. To address this challenge, recent research has explored the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model spatial information for more accurate RUL prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GNN techniques applied to RUL prediction, summarizing existing methods and offering guidance for future research. We first propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages of adapting GNNs to RUL prediction, systematically categorizing approaches into four key stages: graph construction, graph modeling, graph information processing, and graph readout. By organizing the field in this way, we highlight the unique challenges and considerations at each stage of the GNN pipeline. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation of various state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN methods, ensuring consistent experimental settings for fair comparisons. This rigorous analysis yields valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, serving as an experimental guide for researchers and practitioners working in this area. Finally, we identify and discuss several promising research directions that could further advance the field, emphasizing the potential for GNNs to revolutionize RUL prediction and enhance the effectiveness of PHM strategies.

These systems monitor, assess, and communicate risks to support resilience and sustainable development, but challenges remain in hazard forecasting, risk communication, and decision-making.

We highlight the role of AI in developing multi-hazard EWSs that integrate Meteorological and Geospatial foundation models (FMs) for impact prediction. A user-centric approach with intuitive interfaces and community feedback is emphasized to improve crisis management. To address climate risk complexity, we advocate for causal AI models to avoid spurious predictions and stress the need for responsible AI practices. We highlight the FATES (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Sustainability) principles as essential for equitable and trustworthy AI-based Early Warning Systems for all.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using robots within educational environments due to their potential to augment student engagement and motivation. However, current research has not adequately addressed the effectiveness of these robots in facilitating inclusive learning for diverse student populations, particularly those with dyslexia. This study proposes an inclusive learning system developed on two multi-modal robots, Kebbi and Minibo, with interactive (i.e., movable hands) and straightforward features. The system integrates various interactive elements, such as animations, songs, dance, gestures, and touch, to enhance students’ learning engagement, interaction, and motivation and cater to their diverse needs. The study aims to examine the influence of different features from two unique multi-modal robots on the engagement levels of students with/without dyslexia and their needs when engaging with robot learning. Two research questions are posed: (1) What are the features of multi-modal robots that could effectively improve the learning engagements of students with/without dyslexia? (2) What are the needs of students with/without dyslexia when engaging with robot learning? To this end, a comparative study is conducted where 64 students participate in a five-day robot-led training program, while another 73 students receive traditional teacher-led training. Pre/post questionnaires are administered to evaluate students’ engagement levels, and semi-structured interviews are conducted to obtain additional insights. The findings reveal that students with dyslexia are better suited to the interactive and multi-modal features of Kebbi. In contrast, students without dyslexia may prefer the more straightforward features of Minibo, which can still effectively promote engagement and learning. Multi-modal robots can boost engagement and motivation in students with and without dyslexia through novelty and cognitive load management. Emotional connections and interactive elements, such as empathetic and customizable features, enhance engagement and improve learning outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The knowledge discovery from graphical graphs could be challenging. Most of the time, the visual analysis cannot be done solely based on naked eyes interpretation. Therefore, knowledge visualization is vital to assist the process, especially in business intelligence and analytics to improve data insights and cognitive abilities. To effectively facilitate knowledge discovery from visual graphs, different analytical techniques should be explored in analyzing and visualizing the datasets. This study proposes an intelligent system to discover hidden knowledge from educational data by using interactive visualization and prescriptive analytic techniques. It focuses on model processing, as well as the development of an intelligent system to improve students’ academic performance. The method adapted Design Research, comprising of four stages which are 1) problem definition, 2) suggestion, 3) development, and 4) evaluation. Additionally, three stages of data analytics were applied in the development stages, namely 1) descriptive-analytic on Internet usage pattern and students’ academic performance, 2) predictive analytic of students’ academic performance based on Internet usage pattern, and 3) prescriptive analytic to recommend the suitable action to improve students’ academic performance. All these techniques involve data visualization by using the Microsoft Power BI tool. This approach is tested using a real dataset from Higher Learning Institutions, collected from 2017 to 2019. As a result, this leads to the desired knowledge visualization that facilitates the decision-making related to student performance enhancement. Theoretically, this study contributes to enhance the visualization and interpretation of data by using cognitive and reasoning components in prescriptive analytic. Besides, the proposed model enables decision maker in educational domain to make meaningful decisions regarding Internet usage management. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved.},

Dynamic spectrum management and control based on blockchain is efficient and robust, but the cost of traditional consensus mechanisms is too high. In this paper, we propose a new spectrum management and control architecture based on blockchain and deep reinforcement learning, which proposes a new energy-saving consensus mechanism called proof of hierarchy to encourage blockchain users to perform spectrum sensing and detect spectrum violations. Meanwhile, we propose a timely auction mechanism based on deep reinforcement learning for dynamic spectrum management, achieving secure, efficient, and dynamic allocation of spectrum resources. Through intelligent resource allocation and trusted transaction mechanism, efficient spectrum management is realized to improve spectrum utilization and alleviate the shortage of spectrum resources. The simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. We construct a spectrum management scenario and compare it with the traditional spectrum management method. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can allocate spectrum resources more efficiently and provide a better user experience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To describe the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Evidence Alliance's methodological approach to systematically identify 23 high priority health research topics (three in 2021 and 20 in 2023) from patient partners (including caregivers) and members of the public across Canada and beyond. Study Design and Setting: In 2021 and 2023, we collaborated with patient and public partners to co-design and co-conduct two priority setting initiatives. These initiatives involved a diverse group of patients, the public, clinicians, researchers, and health system decision-makers to systematically and collectively prioritize research topics based on their perceived importance and anticipated impact. We used a modified James Lind Alliance approach, where all participants were engaged as equal partners. The prioritization process consisted of the following steps: 1) identification and collection of research priorities from patients and the public; 2) summarizing the research priorities gathered; 3) conducting semistructured interviews (1-on-1 or focus groups depending on the number of submissions for each unique topic), conducting literature searches on each topic to identify relevant knowledge synthesis and appraising the quality of relevant evidence using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) checklist, and preparing lay summaries (1–2 pages) for each unique topic using a predefined template cocreated with patient partners; 4) conducting a priority setting exercise with a multidisciplinary panel consisting of an interim priority setting rating questionnaire to score each topic based on nine questions, followed by a virtual workshop to reach consensus on the final rating and ranking of topics; and 5) facilitating research by funding selected topics and providing capacity-building support to research teams. We conducted a formal process evaluation of engagement, transparency, information management, and considerations of values and context in 2023. Results: A total of 98 topics were received across two research priority setting initiatives. Approximately, half the submissions were made by individuals who identified as patients (2021: 45% [n = 5] and 2023: 52% [n = 45]), whereas the rest identified as caregivers or members of the public. Topics were spread across 26 health themes, with arthritis and osteoporosis (27% [n = 3]) being the most common theme in 2021 and quality of care (26% [n = 23]) in 2023. Twenty-three priorities from 98 topics submitted by patients and public were selected. A formal process evaluation in 2023 revealed 85% of the respondents who participated in the priority setting panel “strongly agreed” that their experience was valuable and they would participate again in a future initiative. The 23 prioritized projects are currently being co-led with the patient and public partner topic submitters and nominated research teams. Conclusion: Priority setting exercises successfully engaged a diverse group of interested parties, resulting in the identification of relevant and impactful research topics. The positive feedback from participants suggests that these exercises were well-received and that similar methodologies should be applied and refined in future efforts. Plain Language Summary: The Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Evidence Alliance used a patient- and public-driven approach to set research priorities across different topics. They conducted two priority setting initiatives in 2021 and 2023, involving patients, the public, researchers, clinicians, and health system managers. This approach aimed to prioritize research topics based on their perceived importance and anticipated impact. A total of 98 topics were received across two research priority setting initiatives, with nearly half the submissions from patients and the other half from caregivers or members of the public. The topics covered 26 health themes, with arthritis and osteoporosis (2021) and quality of care (2023) being the most common themes. From these topics, the 23 highest priority topics were selected by a multidisciplinary priority setting panel. A formal process evaluation in 2023 revealed that 85% of the respondents who participated in the priority setting panel “strongly agreed” that their experience was valuable, and they would participate again in a future initiative. In conclusion, the priority setting exercises successfully engaged a diverse group of individuals and identified important research topics. The positive feedback suggests that this approach was well received and should be applied in future efforts. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can streamline gamification strategies in smart cities by enabling dynamic adjustments to sustain engagement and encourage behavioral change. This work presents an AI-assisted gamification platform, which relies on two core components. The first is a gamification strategy (GS) that focuses on a single rewarded task, making it adaptable for policymakers and practical for adoption. The second is an integrated AI mechanism incorporating a machine learning (ML) model that automatically adjusts gamification rules using Internet of Things (IoT) data and user behavior analysis. These two components are interdependent: the AI mechanism depends on task singularity for transparency, adaptability, and user control, while the single-task GS depends on AI for practicality and long-term flexibility. The strategy centers on positive feedback for rewarding food-related businesses and their employees for adopting a food waste (FW) digestion system at the source, through an interactive platform. A controlled deployment confirmed the system’s feasibility and coherence, highlighting its potential for broader adoption in a unified smart city FW management application. This approach focuses on practicality for wider adoption, aiming to promote sustainable behavior and reduce the environmental impact of FW. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Current deep learning models for channel estimation in cognitive radio networks encounter issues including elevated computing complexity, sluggish adaptability to swiftly changing settings, and limitations in managing the varied characteristics of IoT devices. The Adaptive Skip-based Convolutional Deep-Skip Long Short-Term Memory (AdSk-based ConvD-SkipLSTM) model effectively resolves these challenges by delivering expedited and precise spectrum sensing and channel estimation, hence enhancing overall network performance. The identification of unused spectrum bands is conducted by the energy detection method. Subsequently, channel estimation is executed utilizing the proposed AdSk-based ConvD-SkipLSTM model. The suggested model improves the precision and efficacy of channel estimation, guaranteeing dependable communication. The proposed channel estimation model is evaluated using metrics such as normalized mean square error (NMSE), outage probability, and bit error rate (BER), demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional channel estimation techniques. The proposed method achieved a minimal BER of 1.62E-06 in comparison to current channel estimating techniques. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Efficient and sustainable crop production process management is crucial to meet the growing global demand for food, fuel, and feed while minimizing environmental impacts. Traditional crop management practices, often developed through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms, their application within crop management, and the use of crop management simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Long-term care (LTC) for older people is an area of focus for many health and social policies in high- and middle-income countries. Performance Indicators are used to provide national and subnational jurisdictions with insights to ensure quality of the provided LTC services for older people. Although LTC systems vary across jurisdictions, there is demand for internationally comparable indicators to support countries in monitoring LTC and facilitate mutual learning. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of indicators currently employed to monitor the performance of LTC systems and services in high- and middle- income countries and describe their key characteristics. Methods: A review of the literature in six scientific databases (literature review) and web searches of relevant sites across 43 selected countries (web search) was conducted. We asked country representatives from the Working Party on Health Care Quality and Outcomes of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where most of these countries are represented, to cross-validate the sources of information found (expert consultation). We then extracted and analysed the data from all obtained sources based on a predetermined set of characteristics. Results: The search of scientific databases yielded 12,960 records, from which forty papers were selected for inclusion. The scientific literature findings were complemented by 34 grey literature sources. In total, we identified performance indicators being used to monitor LTC systems and services across 29 national and subnational jurisdictions in 24 out of 43 countries. In total, 620 indicators were identified. All jurisdictions used indicators related to institutional LTC and 16 also used indicators on home care. The most frequently monitored structures, processes, and results were pressure ulcers, falls, use of restraints and pain management. Conclusions: We identified LTC performance indicators currently being monitored in 29 jurisdictions across 24 countries. Many jurisdictions are monitoring similar structures, processes, and results. This presents an opportunity to develop internationally comparable LTC performance indicators based on existing efforts across countries. © The Author(s) 2025.},

Recent advancements in Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have introduced a range of feedback generation and delivery opportunities to improve teaching and learning processes, yet questions remain about how learners engage with such tools and their impact. In this study, we investigated postgraduate students’ engagement with analytics feedback in relation to their level of self-regulated learning (SRL) competence and performance in a semester-long (ten-week) course. We specifically focused on the Interactive-Constructive-Active–Passive (ICAP) framework of cognitive engagement. Initially, students were asked to participate in an established SRL questionnaire, based on Zimmerman’s theory of self-regulation to evaluate their SRL competence (N = 39). Throughout the semester, their online behaviour data from Moodle and Google Docs was collected and analyzed to form personalised analytics feedback for each student. We examined how students with different SRL competencies engage with analytics feedback and the impact of this engagement on students’ course performance. Results indicated that students with high SRL competence actively engage with analytics feedback more than students with low SRL competence. However, students' analytics feedback engagement did not significantly affect their course performance. Additionally, we analyzed students’ reflections on the feedback provided to investigate how they perceived it in relation to their learning experiences and performance. Students argued in their reflections that analytics feedback was beneficial in identifying and regulating their online behaviours and providing motivation through objective insights. They also noted limitations in accurately reflecting their behaviours and learning quality, the need for more personalised recommendations and timely feedback, and suggested design improvements to ensure clarity, foster interaction and incorporate tailored, in-depth insights. We conclude the paper with a discussion on future design and research suggestions for ways of monitoring and supporting students’ cognitive engagement with analytics feedback interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Unhealthy substance use (USU) is common and ranges from use above guideline-recommended levels to severe substance use disorder. USU results in substantial morbidity and mortality yet primary care practices rarely systematically screen, diagnose, and treat USU. Supporting Unhealthy Substance use care Through a whole person Approach and user centered INtegration into primary care (SUSTAIN) tests whether the implementation of a co-designed change package for USU improves patient function. The protocol for SUSTAIN is presented here. Methods: SUSTAIN is a cluster randomized controlled implementation trial of a customized approach to identify and treat USU in primary care. The sample includes 24 primary care clinics in two practice-based research networks (PBRNs). In phase one, primary care practice champions and patients with lived USU experience co-design a change package to identify and treat USU. In phase two, we test the effectiveness of the change package versus usual care and evaluate the implementation of the change package. Data will be collected from 24 clinics (50 patients per clinic for total of 1200 patients) through patient surveys and the electronic health record. Patients surveyed must be 18 or older and screen positive for USU using the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication and other Substance use part one (TAPS-1) tool. Primary outcomes include mental and physical health patient function scales measured using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29-v2). Secondary outcomes are prevalence of USU, recovery, health care utilization, USU screening rates, provision/referral to behavioral health services and prescription of appropriate medications. We will also evaluate implementation outcomes by surveying 96 practice representatives (4 at each clinic) and conduct qualitative interviews with 20 patients and 20 practice leaders to assess their experience with the intervention and its implementation. Conclusions: The SUSTAIN trial creates and tests an implementation package approach to address USU in diverse primary care settings. The SUSTAIN change package aims to transform how primary care practices care for individuals with USU to improve patient outcomes and enhance community well-being. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Dysphagia, a swallowing disorder, requires continuous monitoring of throat-related events to obtain comprehensive insights into the patient’s pharyngeal and laryngeal functions. However, conventional assessments were performed by medical professionals in clinical settings, limiting persistent monitoring. We demonstrate feasibility of a ubiquitous monitoring system for autonomously detecting throat-related events utilizing a soft skin-attachable throat vibration sensor (STVS). The STVS accurately records throat vibrations without interference from surrounding noise, enabling measurement of subtle sounds such as swallowing. Out of the continuous data stream, we automatically classify events of interest using an ensemble-based deep learning model. The proposed model integrates multiple deep neural networks based on multi-modal acoustic features of throat-related events to enhance robustness and accuracy of classification. The performance of our model outperforms previous studies with a classification accuracy of 95.96%. These results show the potential of wearable solutions for improving dysphagia management and patient outcomes outside of clinical environments. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The challenges faced by universities in higher education after the COVID-19 pandemic necessitate the adoption of new tools and practices to maintain student engagement and motivation in alternative teaching methodologies beyond traditional face-to-face learning environments. H5P, an interactive learning tool renowned for its diverse interactive content features, emerges as a promising solution to address these needs. This article discusses the findings of implementing H5P in various courses within the French and Geography departments at the University of Jordan. Data collection involved pre- and post-surveys administered via Moodle and H5P, focusing on student perceptions of H5P features. The study results indicate that both H5P and Moodle can significantly enhance the effectiveness of e-learning. The application of H5P not only facilitated instructional improvements but also personalized learning across five courses. This approach broadened learning opportunities, bolstered student support, and fostered increased engagement. Students who interacted with these resources reported positive experiences and expressed a desire for more interactive elements in future coursework. Furthermore, H5P’s interactive and engaging nature contributed to a more enjoyable and effective learning journey, thereby sustaining student motivation throughout their studies. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital for sustainable energy solutions, with the state of charge (SOC) serving as a critical indicator of their energy levels, directly influencing safety and efficiency. However, accurately estimating SOC remains challenging due to complex internal chemical processes and factors such as unknown data distribution, error accumulation, delayed feedback, and sensitivity to input data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a physics-guided meta-learning framework for cross-task adaptation in SOC estimation. During the model adaptation phase, the challenge of acquiring the maximum capacity prevented the calculation of the SOC at the beginning of the discharge process, which is critical for adaptation or fine-tuning. This framework adapts quickly to new data distributions with the most similarly distributed data and learns adaptive strategies, enabling rapid model updates across various attributes, such as LIB types, temperatures, and operating conditions. Moreover, to further enhance the accuracy and generalization performance of the model, the Coulomb counting method is integrated into the network training process. The physical parameters utilized in Coulomb counting are provided and refined by the neural network, which also generates a separate estimate. Additionally, physical constraints are added to the loss function to guide the update of network parameters. This approach combines physical guidance with the estimation of neural network, thereby partially mitigating the errors inherent in the training process with similar data. We evaluated the estimation model through five-fold cross-validation on 56 datasets. The framework demonstrates strong generalization, achieving robust SOC estimation across varying capacities and conditions. Our work highlights the potential of meta-learning for fast adaptation in SOC estimation under unknown distributions and demonstrates the importance of physical information guidance in improving robustness and performance. This framework can be applied to a wide range of batteries, providing robust support for battery management systems (BMS). © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Dementia is a neurological syndrome marked by cognitive decline. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the common forms of dementia, each with distinct progression patterns. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia cases (AD and FTD) is crucial for effective medical care, as both conditions have similar early-symptoms. EEG, a non-invasive tool for recording brain activity, has shown potential in distinguishing AD from FTD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification system for dementia by analyzing EEG derived scout time-series signals from deep brain regions, specifically the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Scout time series extracted via the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technique are utilized. The time series is converted to image representations using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and fed as input to deep learning models. Two high-density EEG datasets are utilized to validate the efficacy of the proposed method: the online BrainLat dataset (128 channels, comprising 16 AD, 13 FTD, and 19 healthy controls (HC)) and the in-house IITD-AIIA dataset (64 channels, including subjects with 10 AD, 9 MCI, and 8 HC). Different classification strategies and classifier combinations have been utilized for the accurate mapping of classes in both data sets. Results: The best results were achieved using a product of probabilities from classifiers for left and right subcortical regions in conjunction with the DenseNet model architecture. It yield accuracies of 94.17% and 77.72% on the BrainLat and IITD-AIIA datasets, respectively. Conclusions: The results highlight that the image representation-based deep learning approach has the potential to differentiate various stages of dementia. It pave the way for more accurate and early diagnosis, which is crucial for the effective treatment and management of debilitating conditions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient safety incidents are recognized as significant contributors to patient mortality, thus demanding immediate attention and strategic interventions in healthcare systems. The room-of-error education program serves as a solution, as it provides a case-based learning platform allowing nursing students to identify and resolve medical errors within a controlled environment systematically. This study aimed to identify the context, mechanisms, and outcomes of room-of-error training programs. Methods: This study adopted a systematic review methodology aligning with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Comprehensive searches were conducted across key databases, including OvidMEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and CINAHL, by utilizing specific terms related to healthcare providers, nursing students, room-of-error education, medical errors, simulation training, and virtual intervention. Included studies focused on healthcare providers or students, error recognition, RFE-related training, and randomized or quasi-experimental trials, while exclusion criteria were non-English/Korean studies, non-original articles, abstracts, and qualitative studies. Risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies version 2.0 tool. Results: The search strategy yielded 2,447 articles, with eight studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Predominantly quasi-experimental in design, these eight studies primarily focused on nurses as the target population. Simulations were found to be widely integrated into room-of-error programs, emphasizing skill performance and critical thinking. Half of the studies provided preparation time, 37.5% included feedback, and 62.5% covered medication errors, with 87.5% using offline delivery, 62.5% offering individual education, and program durations ranging from 4 to 35 min, with 25% having no time limit for error inspection. Diverse content, including topics such as medication errors and infection control, was found to be delivered through offline or virtual formats and group-based or individual education. Conclusions: The findings provide valuable insights into the characteristics and outcomes of room-of-error training programs for healthcare professionals and students.

	abstract = {In the context of Industry 4.0, manufacturing systems face increased complexity and uncertainty due to elevated product customisation and demand variability. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive Work-In-Progress (WIP) control in semi-heterarchical architectures, addressing the limitations of traditional analytical methods that rely on exponential processing time distributions. Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) enables model-free control of flow-shop production systems under non-exponential, stochastic processing times. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent dynamically manages WIP levels in a CONstant Work In Progress (CONWIP) environment, learning optimal control policies directly from system interactions. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments with varying machine numbers, processing times, and system variability. The results show robust performance in tracking the target throughput and adapting the processing time variability, achieving Mean Absolute Percentual Errors (MAPE) in the throughput – calculated as the percentage difference between the actual and the target throughput – ranging from 0.3% to 2.3% with standard deviations of 5. 5% to 8. 4%. Key contributions include the development of a data-driven WIP control approach to overcome analytical methods’ limitations in stochastic environments, validating DQN agent adaptability across varying production scenarios, and demonstrating framework scalability in realistic manufacturing settings. This research bridges the gap between conventional WIP control methods and Industry 4.0 requirements, offering manufacturers an adaptive solution for enhanced production efficiency. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Water quality management is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran where water scarcity is compounded by quality degradation. This study delves into the causal relationships influencing water quality, focusing on Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) as a primary indicator in the Karkheh River, southwest Iran. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning 50 years (1968–2018), this research integrates Machine Learning (ML) techniques to examine correlations and infer causality among multiple parameters, including flow rate (Q), Sodium (Na+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Calcium (Ca2+), Chloride (Cl−), Sulfate (SO42−), Bicarbonates (HCO3−), and pH. For modeling the causation, the “Back door linear regression” approach has been considered which establishes a stable and interpretable framework in causal inference by focusing on clear assumptions. Predictive modeling was used to show the difference between correlation and causation along with interpretability modeling to make the predictive model transparent. Predictive modeling does not report the causality among the variables as it showed Mg is not contributing to the target (TDS) while the findings reveal that TDS is predominantly positive influenced by Mg, Na, Cl, Ca and SO4, with HCO3 and pH exerting negative (inverse) effects. Unlike correlations, causal relationships demonstrate directional and often unequal influences, highlighting Mg as a critical driver of TDS levels. This novel application of ML-based causal inference in water quality research provides a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional experimental methods. The results underscore the potential of ML-driven causal analysis to guide water resource management and policy-making. By identifying the key drivers of TDS, this study proposes targeted interventions to mitigate water quality deterioration. Moreover, the insights gained lay the foundation for developing early warning systems, ensuring proactive and sustainable water quality management in similar hydrological contexts. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {This study highlights the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) on business logistics and operations, driving efficiency and strategic decision-making. With the logistics AI market anticipated to reach USD 31.58 billion by 2028, AI and ML's role in enhancing operational performance and reducing costs is evident. Despite this, the application of AI and ML in improving strategic performance measures—namely Information Sharing, Decision Synchronization, and Logistics Efficiency—and their influence on firm and operational performance remains underexplored. This research bridges this gap by leveraging the Dynamic Capabilities View to explore how AI and ML technologies influence the relationship between strategic performance indicators and both firm and operational performance. Utilizing a multi-method analysis, including PLS-SEM and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, we explore the complex dynamics between strategic performance outcomes and the integration of AI and ML technologies. Our findings from PLS-SEM indicate that AI and ML significantly influence Firm Performance but not Operational Performance. Further analysis highlights that logistics efficiency, integrated with AI and ML, can enhance firm performance, showcasing AI and ML as critical components of firm success. This study contributes to the fields of information systems and supply chain management by offering an innovative perspective on how AI and ML can empower firms, particularly within the United States and Canadian Business to Business and Business to Government sectors, to improve their firm and operational performance. It provides a strategic framework for managers to leverage these technologies effectively, enriching both theory and practice. © 2025},

Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven systems that monitor air quality in real-time and utilize historical data for accurate forecasting have emerged as effective solutions to this challenge. However, these systems often raise privacy concerns, as they may inadvertently expose sensitive information about occupants' habits and presence. Addressing these privacy challenges is essential. This research comprehensively reviews the existing literature on traditional and AI-based IAQ management, focusing on privacy-preserving techniques. The analysis reveals that while significant progress has been made in IAQ monitoring, most systems prioritize accuracy at the expense of privacy. Existing approaches often fail to adequately address the risks associated with data collection and the implications for occupant privacy. Emerging AI-driven technologies, such as federated learning and edge computing, offer promising solutions by processing data locally and minimizing privacy risks. This research introduces a novel AI-based IAQ management platform incorporating the SITA (Spatial, Identity, Temporal, and Activity) model. By leveraging customizable privacy settings, the platform enables users to safeguard sensitive information while ensuring effective IAQ management. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, edge computing, and advanced privacy-preserving technologies, the proposed system delivers a robust and scalable solution that protects both privacy and health. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Methane solubility in brine is a critical parameter in various natural and industrial processes, including gas production, storage, chemical engineering, and environmental studies. This study develops and validates explicit predictive correlations for methane solubility in brine using two robust white-box machine learning techniques, including the multigene genetic programming (MGGP) and the group method of data handling (GMDH). A comprehensive database of 684 experimental data points, covering extensive operational conditions of pressure (0.433-140 MPa), temperature (273.15-493.15 K), and NaCl molality (0-5.4 mol/kg), was employed to train and test the proposed correlations. The accuracy of the correlations was assessed using statistical metrics, error distribution analyses, and graphical techniques. Results revealed that both correlations yielded excellent predictive accuracy, with the MGGP-based scheme consistently outperforming the GMDH model by achieving a lower total RMSE value of 0.000243. Furthermore, the trend analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method demonstrated that the MGGP-based correlation successfully captured the physical trends of methane solubility in methane with respect to the input features. Additionally, a comparison with some prior paradigms showed the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of the MGGP-based correlation. Lastly, the applicability domain of the MGGP-based correlation was defined using the Leverage approach, confirming its robustness, with 98.538% of the data points falling within the trust region. The explicit nature of the MGGP-based correlation allows for its integration into environmental management and sustainability frameworks, facilitating improved assessments of methane behavior in natural systems. This integration enables the development of more efficient and effective strategies for methane emission mitigation and climate change mitigation efforts. Furthermore, these models enhance sustainability by supporting the design of environmentally responsible industrial operations. Beyond these applications, the correlation is also well-suited for phase equilibrium modeling, reservoir simulations, and optimization tasks, offering a versatile tool for both environmental and engineering purposes. © 2025 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Microchannel heat sinks play a vital role in modern technology due to the increasing demand for efficient thermal management in compact electronic devices. These systems enhance heat dissipation and maintain optimal operating temperatures, yet conventional heat sinks often fail to meet the stringent cooling demands of modern technologies. To address this, a novel microchannel heat sink reinforced with Y-shaped fins was introduced as an advanced cooling solution. Unlike traditional straight fins, Y-shaped fins improve flow distribution, reduce hot spots, and enhance temperature uniformity across the system's surface. Artificial neural network models were developed to evaluate the impact of fin geometry on performance. Key geometric parameters, including fin attack angle, vertical spacing, and horizontal spacing, were used as input variables, while the Nusselt number and pressure drop were selected as performance outputs. The results revealed that the fin attack angle was the most influential parameter affecting the outputs. The applied cost functions demonstrated the high accuracy of the models in predicting system performance. A genetic algorithm was employed for single-objective optimization targeting three criteria: maximizing total efficiency, minimizing pressure drop, and maximizing the Nusselt number. Two optimized designs were proposed. Design 1 (with an attack angle of 60°, vertical spacing of 120 μm, and horizontal spacing of 400 μm) was optimal for maximizing total efficiency and minimizing the pressure drop. This design achieved a 69.26 % increase in the Nusselt number and a 42.9 % improvement in total efficiency compared to the finless design. Design 2 (with an attack angle of 120°, vertical spacing of 175.650 μm, and horizontal spacing of 200 μm) focused on only maximizing heat transfer, resulting in a 109.28 % increase in the Nusselt number and a 27.1 % improvement in total efficiency. A multi-objective optimization process was conducted in response to the need to balance these multiple objectives. The TOPSIS analysis and Pareto fronts for the Nusselt number and pressure drop were generated to provide a comprehensive framework for designing an efficient and practical microchannel heat sink. © 2025 The Authors},

However, there is a scarcity of research focusing on improving the quality of help-seekers’ questions. Furthermore, previous methods have overlooked the complexity of answerers’ decision-making process when answering to questions. To this end, we propose a Two-stage Multi-task Learning Approach (TsMLA) that predicts and interprets received answers for the given question. Our model considers interactions between different views of information by introducing early and late fusion mechanisms to capture memory activation between titles and descriptions. Then, we incorporate the number of answers over a specific period as an auxiliary task to enhance predictive performance. More importantly, motivated by answerers’ decision-making behavior, we design a two-stage approach to consider interactions between different pieces of features. Our experiments demonstrate that TsMLA significantly outperforms several benchmark methods and obtains better performance. Case studies demonstrate the interpretability of our model. Our results have critical implications for health information system to design computational artifacts.

Traditional approaches using self-reports or performance-based proxies have limited researchers’ ability to study how management control systems influence behavior through effort. Using a controlled experiment with a decoding task, we examine how piece-rate versus flat-wage compensation influences effort intensity and performance. Our findings show that pupil dilation partially mediates the relationship between incentives and performance, with this mediation strongest in early experimental rounds before weakening over time. This dynamic pattern suggests that while incentives initially influence performance through effort intensity, other mechanisms such as implicit learning emerge in later rounds. Beyond demonstrating pupillometry's validity for measuring effort intensity, we highlight its potential applications across management accounting research streams, enabling researchers to better understand how control system elements influence behavior through effort. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Trajectory tracking is one of the key technologies for ensuring safe navigation of the unmanned surface vessel (USV), whose main challenges are the low control accuracy and uncertainties caused by environmental disturbances. In this study, an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed based on the Actor-Critic (AC) reinforcement learning strategy. First, a traditional MPC method is used for USV trajectory tracking. Then, the AC strategy is integrated to continuously adjust the state weight coefficients in the model predictive controller to address the increased error problem resulting from suboptimal control parameters. Finally, the prediction step size in the MPC is adaptively improved based on changes in reinforcement learning reward values and the selection of state-weight parameters. Simulation results show that the AC-MPC method adjusts the state-weight parameters quickly, and selects the appropriate prediction step size according to the change of the reward value. The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of parameter adjustment when using the model predictive controller for trajectory tracking, thereby enhancing the adaptability of the controller in performing trajectory tracking tasks across various environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: The deteriorating mental health of children and young people in the United Kingdom poses a challenge that services and policy makers have found difficult to tackle. Kailo responds to this issue with a community-based participatory and systemically informed strategy, perceiving mental health and well-being as a dynamic state shaped by the interplay of broader health determinants. The initiative works to explore, define and implement locally relevant solutions to challenges shaping the mental health and well-being of young people. Kailo unfolds in three stages within each locale. These stages encompass: “early discovery”, “deeper discovery and co-design” and “implementation”. This document delves into the participatory group model building and design protocol occurring in the “deeper discovery and co-design” stage of the project. Methods: Participatory methods, such as group model building, are effective in articulating and building consensus on complex issues like the social determinants of adolescent mental health. This paper describes the protocol for application of group model building within the Kailo design process to develop causal loop diagrams and pinpoint leverage points for improving adolescent mental health. It also suggests a method for considering modifications to delivery within a unique project context and in alignment with participants’ needs. This paper sets out to define the approach and clarify the objectives these engagements aim to fulfil. The method adapts existing group model building (GMB) protocols for use in a community setting. The engagements will involve groups of local young people and existing community members. To assess the success of the session’s implementation post-delivery, the study utilizes existing frameworks for fidelity evaluations, which define a core and flex model. Discussion: The method described enables an integration of diverse local understandings of complex processes which provides a platform for creating co-designed interventions. This protocol can be used to further strengthen research and design through incorporating complexity and participation into the formulation of contextually relevant policies and practices. The strengths and limitations of the approach are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Proper self-regulating skills are essential in the new reality of digital learning in higher education. Research has shown that the trace data of students’ learning management system activity can identify various online learning tactics and strategies, but also their transitional dynamics, which are linked to academic performance. This study builds on this work by examining how learning tactics and strategies change within individual courses and how this relates to academic performance. A substantial dataset of 41 courses over two academic years at one university is analyzed. Employing Markov models on trace data, we identify prevalent tactics and strategies students use throughout courses. Our study examines shifts in strategy usage, comparing patterns between the initial and latter stages of the courses. The results reveal distinct clusters of learning strategies and their impact on academic achievement. Notably, deep learning strategies show significantly superior performance to surface approaches, especially when maintained over time. Moreover, students who consistently apply the same strategy score higher than those who are inconsistent. However, consistent surface learners score significantly lower than inconsistent learners. Underscoring such longitudinal trends could help interventions, aiding educators in targeting students with weaker strategies at specific times to boost their effectiveness and efficiency. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of self-regulated learning behaviors in online educational contexts by showing the importance of dynamic transition of learning strategies for educators, instructional designers, and policymakers to enhance student learning experiences and outcomes. © 2025},

	abstract = {Background: The sub-Saharan African Regional Partnership for mental health and capacity building (SHARP) study was a clinic-randomized trial of two implementation strategies for integrating depression screening and treatment into non-communicable diseases’ (NCD) clinics in Malawi between 2019 and 2022. We report on the barriers to implementing depression care integration at SHARP study sites and potential solutions. Methods: N = 39 in-depth interviews with participants from all ten sites were conducted, recorded, transcribed, coded in NVivo 12 and analyzed by qualitative experts. We used thematic analysis to identify implementation challenges and potential solutions. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research helped to develop guides and organize the results. Results: Outer setting barriers included high workload (due to high patient volume, increased paperwork, shortage of staff), the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, staff turnover and negative provider attitudes. Limited clinic space arose as an inner setting barrier. Workload can be overcome by increasing the number of NCD personnel, decentralizing the depression/NCD services and integrating mental health and NCD documents (implementation process). The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges including fear of interpersonal contact and changes in scheduling staff that were difficult to overcome in the short term. To deal with the effects of staff turnover, participants identified the need for continuous depression training to new providers. Lobbying for more rooms from leadership can address concerns of limited space. To reduce negative provider attitudes, participants urged facility leadership to make themselves available for consultations and mentorship and to provide continuous learning opportunities such as refresher trainings. Conclusion: The experience in the SHARP study highlights the need for a culture of continuous learning and adaptation in healthcare settings, enabling the development of strategies to overcome evolving challenges. Planning for the integration of mental health and NCD care should extend beyond immediate challenges and consider long-term goals and sustainability.

This research offers a novel methodology to overcome this difficulty and better use renewable resources while satisfying the growing needs of the energy market. To maximize the MG’s performance, this approach combines fuzzy control, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with soft switching technologies. Two predictive rules are used in the design of the control system to handle the particular requirements of either the grid-connected or islanded mode depending on the MG’s operational condition.

	abstract = {Background: Africa’s involvement in clinical trials remains very low. Although the crucial role of training initiatives in building clinical trial capacity in Africa has been documented, current efforts fall short as they lack alignment with local contexts. This study aimed to design, develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative clinical trial operations training program for Africa. Methods: We developed ClinOps, a novel 10-week clinical trial operations training program for study coordinators in Africa to enhance their expertise in four fundamental areas: designing, conducting, managing, and reporting clinical trials. To streamline the learning process, we used cloud-based applications that minimize the need for software installations while maximizing student engagement. VoiceThread facilitated interactive content that could be accessed offline. Moodle, an open-source learning management system, offered a platform for sharing learning tools, mentorship, and rubric-driven competency assessments, including quizzes, forums, tutorials, and group assignments. We utilized Zoom for live tutorials and mentoring as required. Effectiveness of the program was evaluated through quantitative pre- and post-surveys, qualitative end-course evaluations, and a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework. The pre- and post-surveys measured changes in trainees’ confidence in clinical trial domains and leadership and coordination skills. End-course evaluations gathered feedback on the course content, organization, technology, and instructional methods. We used Wilcoxon rank test to analyze pre- and post-survey scores and thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data. Results: In the initial cohort, 88 study coordinators from 19 countries participated, including 56 (64%) females, with 57 (65%) actively employed as study coordinators during the training, and 85 (97%) possessing prior experience in clinical trial roles. Among these, 71 (81%) successfully completed the course, with 69 (97%) also completing the post-course assessment. Post-training scores demonstrated substantial improvement compared to pre-training scores in each competency area, including in designing (pre-post training median score = 3.6 vs. 4.6, median difference = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8–1.1, p < 0.001), managing (pre-posttest median score = 3.4 vs. 4.2, median difference = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.8, p < 0.001), conducting (pre-post training median score = 3.9 vs. 4.7, median difference = 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.0, p < 0.001), and reporting (pre-posttest median score = 3.0 vs. 4.5, median difference = 1.0, 95% CI 0.9–1.5, p < 0.001) clinical trials. The monitoring and evaluation data confirm the program’s adherence to training best practices, including alignment with local priorities, country ownership, pedagogic innovation, institutional capacity building, sustainability, and ongoing partnerships. The end-course evaluation reflects participants’ positive feedback on the program’s structure, content, relevance to their current roles, and overall delivery methods. Conclusion: The ClinOps program, designed by experts from academia and product development partners, enhanced participants’ clinical trial competencies. To effectively build clinical trials capacity on the continent, training programs should provide thorough competency development in designing, conducting, managing, and reporting trials. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduces cardiovascular risk. International lipid management guidelines recommend LDL-cholesterol goals or thresholds for initiating lipid-lowering therapy. However, contemporary real-world studies have shown that many high- and very high-risk patients are not attaining LDL-cholesterol goals and are not receiving intensive lipid-lowering therapies. In this review, recent examples of implementation strategies for optimising lipid management are discussed. Recent Findings: Implementation studies are heterogenous in their strategies and design. At the clinician level, multidisciplinary team-based care (including multidisciplinary lipid clinics), pharmacist- or nurse-led interventions, decision-support algorithms or protocols, and educational initiatives have shown potential to improve lipid management. Various strategies to improve patient adherence to lipid-lowering therapies have demonstrated at least short-term efficacy, including education, shared decision-making, behavioural support and nudges. Electronic health records can be leveraged at low cost to identify patients requiring initiation or intensification of lipid-lowering therapies, but the optimal method of integrating automated alerts or nudges to influence decision-making requires further research. Moreover, telehealth and remote care delivery models can improve access to healthcare and facilitate lipid-lowering. Summary: Multifaceted strategies with a systematic approach to targeting clinician, patient and system related factors can be successful in improving lipid management. Future implementation research should evaluate longer-term outcomes and follow implementation science theories, models and/or frameworks at all stages. By doing so, ongoing implementation studies will help researchers better understand the impact, sustainability and scalability of strategies, and where barriers and facilitators to lipid management may exist in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2025.},

From 6/1/2021–8/31/2022, 171,010 UTI diagnoses were recorded, with UTIS used in 75,630 cases involving antibiotic prescriptions. Overall acceptance rate of UTIS recommendations was 66.0%. Among 19,287 cases with urine cultures, antibiotic mismatch rate was significantly lower when UTIS recommendations were followed (8.9% vs. 14.2%, p < 0.0001). Among women over 18, mismatch rate was 47.5% lower, and among women over 50, 55.6% lower (p < 0.001). Additionally, an overall reduction of 80.5% in ciprofloxacin usage (6.4% vs 32.9%, p < 0.0001) was observed.

	abstract = {Accurate short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for optimizing energy management and maintaining grid stability within the rapidly growing renewable energy sector. However, the inherent high sensitivity of PV systems to varying weather conditions poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. Existing research endeavours to enhance short-term forecasting accuracy through two primary approaches. On the one hand, some studies incorporate weather variables as input features to improve prediction precision, yet this method often falls short of fully capturing the intricate and dynamic interactions between diverse weather factors and PV output. On the other hand, most correction methods utilize error correction (EC) techniques that adjust initial PV forecasts based on predicted errors. Nonetheless, the highly volatile nature of error sequences substantially restricts the effectiveness of EC, as these unpredictable errors compromise the reliability of the corrective adjustments. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage framework that leverages weather information from multiple perspectives to enhance short-term PV power forecasting accuracy. In the first stage, a customized multi-task learning (MTL) framework employs a task interaction matrix to differentiate between task-specific and shared features, thereby facilitating meaningful interactions between PV output and weather variables while providing interpretability. Additionally, a dynamic loss weighting mechanism ensures balanced training across tasks. In the second stage, we implement a nonlinear weather correction (WC) module using neural networks, which refines the initial PV predictions by effectively incorporating the predicted weather variables, thereby enhancing both accuracy and robustness. Experimental validation using real PV data from the Northern Territory, Australia, demonstrates that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models across various seasons and confirms the effectiveness of each component within the framework through ablative experiments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: There has been increased use of prehospital point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) in recent years. Lack of governance structure and evidence of benefit have been described as major barriers to its implementation. This paper describes a novel approach to implementation of prehospital PoCUS and clinical governance framework in a UK HEMS. Methods: A retrospective database review was undertaken at London’s Air Ambulance (LAA) from 1st September 2021 to 31st March 2023. All patients who had PoCUS examination were included. Scans were archived in a cloud-based server and reviewed weekly by expert clinicians. They were graded in adequacy, agreement between reviewer and clinician was recorded and fed back to the clinicians allowing continuous feedback learning. In-hospital diagnosis was sought for patients having the full Pump, Pleura and Pouring blood (PPPB) protocol. Cohen’s Kappa (ƙ) was calculated for inter-rater reliability. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was performed using 2 × 2 tables. Results: LAA attended 3,068 missions. Our reviewers identified 701 PoCUS scanning encounters and 628 were included in the final analysis. Clinicians performed 420 scans for pneumothorax, 308 for free fluid and 305 pericardial effusions respectively. Majority of the population were male (85%) who sustained traumatic (93.5%) thoracic injuries (65%). Paramedics performed 29% of the scans. Reviewers deemed 83% of the scans of adequate quality. Inter-rater reliability between clinicians and reviewers was 0.6 for pericardial effusion, 0.67 for pneumothorax and 0.71 for free fluid respectively. A full PPPB protocol was performed in 52 patients out of which 46 were included. The sensitivity and specificity of PPPB protocol for diagnosis life-threatening injuries was 0.5 and 0.9 respectively. Conclusion: Introduction of prehospital PoCUS in a HEM service utilizing high quality training, user-friendly workflow and image archiving system, robust governance framework and continuous feedback may be feasible allowing high quality ultrasound examinations. The bespoke PPPB protocol in prehospital may improve diagnosis of life-threatening injuries. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The thermal issues of lithium-ion batteries significantly affect their performance, safety, and lifespan, and are one of the main obstacles hindering the further development of electric vehicles. Accurate tracking and prediction of the temperature distribution of lithium-ion batteries provide feedback for the Battery Management System, which is crucial for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the battery system. At present, temperature estimation methods for battery systems mostly rely on physical models with numerous parameters, which fail to reflect the overall temperature distribution of large-format batteries. On the other hand, data-driven models for battery temperature require large amounts of training data and are prone to overfitting and other problems. These models lead to problems such as low accuracy in temperature estimation for battery systems, a high demand for training data, and poor model interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network model based on the thermal physical model of large-format batteries. By embedding the thermal-physical model information of the battery into the neural network, the model can accurately predict the evolution of the lithium-ion batteries temperature under various operating conditions. Experimental results show that under different constant current and dynamic conditions, the maximum Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error of the Physics-Informed Neural Network model do not exceed 0.6 °C. Compared with traditional methods, this approach significantly enhances the precision and interpretability of the model with smaller datasets, providing a more accurate basis for temperature distribution in battery management system. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

However, in a decentralized supply chain, there is no known optimal advertising and ordering policy for different participants. Motivated by this, we integrate inventory control with the expectation-based reference price in a two-player supply chain where a manufacturer provides a cooperative advertising program for a retailer. After eliciting the problem as an infinite-horizon Stackelberg game, we propose a novel Leader-Follower Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LFDDPG) algorithm. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms metaheuristics with regard to different configurations of demand distribution and costs. Similar results are observed using data from a real-life manufacturer. Furthermore, our algorithm is robust in hyperparameter spaces and exhibits superior convergence behavior. These findings provide valuable insights and pave the way for future research and practical implementations in supply chains with complex decision-making processes. © 2025},

Here we introduce SyncKnee, a knee-monitoring system that tracks both joint angles and swelling patterns, providing detailed knee-state monitoring for daily use. SyncKnee consists of three components: a stretch sensor pad, a multi-modal machine-learning model, and personalized information support. The sensor, made from poly(SBS) fiber and eutectic gallium-indium alloy, tracks skin deformation from bending and swelling. Robotic-arm-driven tests confirm sensor accuracy in responding to bending and swelling. In the user study with 15 participants performing five distinct knee maneuvers, our system with a random forest model achieves 98.48% accuracy in recognizing knee behaviors.

Indigenous cropping systems are relevant to scientifically addressing many of the shortcomings and problems regarding current cropping systems. Indigenous food sovereignty movements are currently preserving and expanding their cropping system food ways. The knowledge underlying these efforts is not static but dynamic, incorporating contemporary tools in ever changing environments. We highlight four principles of Indigenous farming that are reflected in both practice and cultural traditions: polycultures, seed-keeping, sustainability, and community. These principles have been pivotal to the primary author’s doctoral research as they collaborate with Indigenous communities in Wisconsin to trial organic farming practices that utilize their traditional values and knowledge. We encourage more applied research in farming and natural sciences that uphold Indigenous ways of knowing as equal to Western science through collaborating with Indigenous Peoples. Researchers should be aware of the implications of research in Indigenous communities, involving the cultural boundaries associated with crops and seeds, which are often not regulated and thus warrant protection. As Western science seeks to find sustainable alternatives to current farming norms, as seen in other areas of land management, we encourage creating shared learning environments between researchers and Indigenous Peoples to foster relevant and equitable outcomes for farming practices. © 2025 by the Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: This research is quantitative in nature and convenience sampling is followed to gather data from 307 trained faculty (those who deliver lectures by using different tools i.e. Microsoft Team, Zoom, learning management systems, etc.) from various universities of the federal capital territory (FCT) Islamabad and district Rawalpindi of Punjab province, Pakistan who worked online from home during novel corona lockdown. SmartPLS is used for data analysis and structural equation modeling is performed to test the suggested model. Findings: Results revealed that AI awareness has a significant positive influence on knowledge sharing but exhibited a negative significant impact on teacher performance. Likewise, knowledge sharing acts as a partial mediator; however, transformational leadership moderates between remote working and knowledge sharing. Originality/value: During the pandemic, the mode of instruction shifted from physical to online, generating several barriers for teachers who were used to on-campus teaching. This research presented an effective model for knowing the mechanism of possible and reliable implications at educational institutions of developing countries to get the desired outcomes of effective online teaching in calamity situations. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various smart city-based applications such as healthcare, traffic management systems, environment sensing systems, and public safety systems produce large volumes of data. To process these data, it requires substantial computing and storage resources for smooth implementation and execution. While centralized cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and resource sharing, it faces significant limitations in IoT-based applications, especially in terms of latency, bandwidth, security, and cost. The fog computing paradigm complements the existing cloud computing services at the edge of the network to facilitate the various services without sending the data to a centralized cloud server. By processing the data in fog computing, it satisfies the delay requirement of various time-sensitive services of IoT applications. However, many resource-intensive IoT systems exist that require substantial computing resources for their processing. In such scenarios, finding the optimal computing node for processing and executing the service is a challenge. The optimal placement of various IoT applications services in heterogeneous fog computing environments is a well-known NP-complete problem. To solve this problem, various authors proposed different algorithms like the randomized algorithm, heuristic algorithm, meta heuristic algorithm, machine learning algorithm, and graph-based algorithm for finding the optimal placement. In the present survey, we first describe the fundamental and mathematical aspects of the three-layer IoT–fog–cloud computing model.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, blended learning has become a crucial aspect of modern education. However, the fragmented use of various teaching platforms, such as Xuexitong and Rain Classroom, has led to the dispersion of teaching data. This not only increases the cognitive load on teachers and students but also hinders the systematic recording of teaching activities and learning outcomes. Moreover, existing blended learning evaluation systems exhibit significant shortcomings in large-scale data storage and secure sharing. To address these issues, this study designs a blended teaching evaluation management system based on blockchain and searchable encryption. First, an on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage model is established using the Ethereum blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure secure and large-scale storage of student work data. Next, a role-based access control scheme utilizing smart contracts is proposed to effectively prevent unauthorized access. Simultaneously, a searchable encryption scheme is designed using AES-CBC-256 and SHA-256 algorithms, enabling data sharing while safeguarding data privacy. Additionally, the smart contract comprehensively records students’ grade information, including weekly regular scores, midterm scores, final scores, overall scores, and their rankings, ensuring transparency in the evaluation process. Based on these technical solutions, a general-purpose teaching evaluation management system (B-Education) is developed. The experimental results demonstrate that the system accurately records teaching activities and learning outcomes, improving the transparency of teaching evaluations while ensuring data security and privacy. The system’s gas consumption remains within a reasonable range, demonstrating good flexibility and usability. Educational institutions can flexibly configure course evaluation criteria and adjust the weighting of various grades based on their specific needs. This study provides an innovative solution for blended teaching evaluation, offering significant theoretical value and practical implications. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction Manual investigation of falls incidents for quality improvement is time-consuming for clinical staff. Routine care delivery generates a large volume of relevant data in disparate systems, yet these data are seldom integrated and transformed into real-time, actionable insights for frontline staff. This protocol describes the co-design and testing of a safe mobility and falls informatics platform for automated, real-time insights to support the learning response to inpatient falls. Methods Underpinned by the learning health system model and human-centred design principles, this mixed-methods study will involve (1) collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, data scientists and researchers to co-design a safe mobility and falls informatics platform; (2) co-production of natural language processing pipelines and integration with a user interface for automated, near-real-time insights and (3) platform usability testing. Platform features (data taxonomy and insights display) will be co-designed during workshops with lay partners and clinical staff. The data to be included in the informatics platform will be curated from electronic health records and incident reports within an existing secure data environment, with appropriate data access approvals and controls. Exploratory analysis of a preliminary static dataset will examine the variety (structured/unstructured), veracity (accuracy/completeness) and value (clinical utility) of the data. Based on these initial insights and further consultation with lay partners and clinical staff, a final data extraction template will be agreed. Natural language processing pipelines will be co-produced, clinically validated and integrated with QlikView. Prototype testing will be underpinned by the Technology Acceptance Model, comprising a validated survey and think-aloud interviews to inform platform optimisation. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol was approved by the National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre Data Access and Prioritisation Committee (Database: iCARE - Research Data Environment; REC reference: 21/SW/0120).

To overcome the barriers to DSS adoption, this study analyses survey data from 31 farmers and 94 farm advisors, researchers and developers across 11 European countries. Using machine learning techniques, respondents were first categorised into clusters based on their responses to the questionnaire. The clusters were then explained using classification trees. For each cluster, customised approaches were proposed to overcome the barriers to DSS adoption. For farmers, these include building trust through co-development, offering free trials, organising practical workshops and providing clear instructions for use. For farm advisors and researchers, involvement in the development of DSS and giving them access to information about the characteristics of the DSS is crucial. IPM DSS developers should focus on 14 key recommendations to improve trust and the ease of use, increase the transparency of DSS descriptions and validation, and extend development to underserved sectors such as viticulture and vegetable farming. These recommendations aim to increase the uptake of DSSs to ultimately improve the implementation of IPM practises and help reduce the risk and use of pesticides across Europe despite the ever-growing challenges in agriculture. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the integration of distributed renewable energy into smart grids, the uncertainty of distributed systems and new energy generation seriously affect the stable operation of power grids. Demand-side management is a method for solving distributed electricity usage issues, thus monitoring the types of loads connected to the system has become a hot research topic. Load monitoring includes invasive load monitoring (ILM) and non-invasive load monitoring (NILM). Currently, NILM lacks an incremental capability and has a low recognition accuracy. The study proposes an electricity terminal multi-label recognition with a “One-Versus-All” rejection recognition algorithm based on adaptive distillation increment learning and attention MobileNetV2 network (ET-MR “OVA” RR-ADIL-AMN). The algorithm combines multi-label recognition with a “One-Versus-All” rejection recognition algorithm (MR “OVA” RR), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive distillation increment learning (ADIL), attention MobileNetV2 network (AMN) for electricity terminal recognition. The AMN consists of channel attention mechanism (CAM), co-attention, and MobileNetV2. The CAM significantly enhances the ability to characterize different channels, while the co-attention mechanism focuses on the spatial dimension to extract information about the feature map at different locations. The MobileNetV2 network is employed to optimize computational efficiency and model size through an inverted residual structure, depth separable convolution (DSC), and a linear bottleneck layer. The integration of attention mechanisms (AMs) into MobileNetV2 allows the model not only to maintain the original computational efficiency but also to process input data more efficiently than the MobileNetV2 network by dynamically readjusting the weights of the feature channels and spatial information. ADIL includes an adaptive distillation selector (ADS) and a variable learning rate controller (VLRC). The ADS can select suitable distillation samples by introducing distillation strategies. The distillation strategy allows the algorithm to absorb new categories of information while retaining the learning of old knowledge, contributing to balancing the transfer of old and new knowledge and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The VLRC can reduce the learning rate in the specific direction of the co-attention mechanism, preventing shocks during the incremental learning process. The MR “OVA” RR algorithm adopts a “One-Versus-All” strategy to convert multi-label problems into many binary classification problems (BCPs). The rejection recognition operation is accomplished by comparing the confidence probability values output by SVM with a set threshold. By incorporating a rejection recognition strategy into multi-label recognition, unreliable decisions of the classifier are retained, consequently enhancing the accuracy of load type recognition. Experimental results show that ADIL saves 49 min compared to retraining after completing the incremental learning task for all 10 load types. After integrating the MR “OVA” RR algorithm, the average accuracy of the first-round model reaches 97.13 %. When the rejection recognition samples are inputted into a simple MobileNetV2 model for identification, the accuracy of the overall algorithm reaches 99.84 %. In contrast to other neural networks, the AMN demonstrates optimal performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98.38.60 %, 98.27 %, 98.31 %, and 98.38 % respectively, showing improvements of 2.78 %, 2.21 %, 2.53 %, and 2.78 %. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The proposed data-driven multiphase virtual flow meter (DD-MVFM) blends data-driven ensemble machine learning with historical portable test reports. It provides precise real-time estimates of oil, gas, and water flow rates, along with production predictions. A key novelty is its efficient use of existing hardware for wellhead measurements such as temperature and pressure. The DD-MVFM can serve in three distinct ways: as a verification tool for multiphase physical flow meters (MPFMs), ensuring their accuracy; as a redundant system when MPFMs are unavailable or undergoing maintenance; and as a standalone replacement for MPFMs, significantly reducing operating costs and eliminating the need for extensive infrastructure setup. This innovation contributes to the crucial objective of reducing CO2 emissions. The development of the DD-MVFM involves the fusion of data wrangling and machine learning algorithms for optimal performance. Initial testing indicates an 85% success rate, with potential for further improvement as more field test data are incorporated, making it a pioneering solution in the field of oil and gas management. © Tsinghua University Press 2025.},

	abstract = {Background/Objectives: This systematic review integrates Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Educational Neuroscience (EdNeuro), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to examine their combined impact on optimizing learning environments. It explores how AI-driven adaptive learning systems, informed by neurophysiological insights, enhance personalized education for K-12 students and adult learners. This study emphasizes the role of Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and other neurophysiological tools in assessing cognitive states and guiding AI-powered interventions to refine instructional strategies dynamically. Methods: This study reviews n = 103 papers related to the integration of principles of CLT with AI and ML in educational settings. It evaluates the progress made in neuroadaptive learning technologies, especially the real-time management of cognitive load, personalized feedback systems, and the multimodal applications of AI. Besides that, this research examines key hurdles such as data privacy, ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and scalability issues while pinpointing best practices for robust and effective implementation. Results: The results show that AI and ML significantly improve Learning Efficacy due to managing cognitive load automatically, providing personalized instruction, and adapting learning pathways dynamically based on real-time neurophysiological data. Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) improve classification accuracy, making AI-powered adaptive learning systems more efficient and scalable. Multimodal approaches enhance system robustness by mitigating signal variability and noise-related limitations by combining EEG with fMRI, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Despite these advances, practical implementation challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data security risks, and accessibility disparities across learner demographics. Conclusions: AI and ML are epitomes of redefinition potentials that solid ethical frameworks, inclusive design, and scalable methodologies must inform. Future studies will be necessary for refining pre-processing techniques, expanding the variety of datasets, and advancing multimodal neuroadaptive learning for developing high-accuracy, affordable, and ethically responsible AI-driven educational systems. The future of AI-enhanced education should be inclusive, equitable, and effective across various learning populations that would surmount technological limitations and ethical dilemmas. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This experience report documents an attempt at embracing the “A’s for all” and equitable grading frameworks in an introductory, proof writing-based discrete mathematics course for computer science majors (with N = 138 students) at a medium-sized research-oriented university in the US. Unlike in introductory programming contexts, there is so far no reliable automated grading system that gives formative and adaptive feedback supporting the scope of a proof-based discrete mathematics course. We therefore faced the unique challenge of being unable to automate all assessments and directly offer all students unlimited attempts toward mastery. To address this issue, we adopted a hybrid approach in designing our formative assessments. Using the Exemplary, Satisfactory, Not Yet, and Unassessable (ESNU) discrete grading model, we required all students to get a Satisfactory or above in every question in every assignment within two rounds of human feedback. Students not meeting the goal after two attempts then consulted with course staff members in one-on-one interactions to get diagnostic feedback at any time at their convenience until the semester ended. We document our course policy design in detail, then present data that summarizes both the grading outcomes and student sentiments. We also discuss the lessons learned from our initiative and the necessary staff-side management practices that support our design. This report outlines an example of adopting the A’s for all and equitable grading framework in a course context where not all contents can be made autogradable. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Poor solid waste management in Kisumu, Kenya, contributes to adverse health, social, and environmental outcomes as a result of open burning, illegal dumping, and reliance on landfills. Taking Kisumu as a case study, we use behavioural systems mapping (BSM) for the purpose of understanding the role of behaviour in this complex problem. We qualitatively analysed transcripts from focus groups and interviews with 45 stakeholders in Kisumu to construct a BSM of the perceived actors, behaviours, and behavioural influences affecting waste management, as well as causal links. Influences were analysed using the capability, opportunity, and motivation model of behaviour (COM-B). The resulting BSM connects 24 behaviours by 12 different actors and 49 unique influences (30 related to opportunity, 16 to motivation, and 3 to capability). It reflects three sub-systems: policy-making, public waste management, and the policy–public interface. Six key feedback loops are described, which suggest that cycles of underfunding are interlinked with problematic practices around the build-up, handling, and segregation of waste and conflicting public and political views around responsibility. We demonstrate how the BSM method can be used with transcript data and provide steps that others can follow to inform the design of systemic behaviour change interventions. Further research to validate and adapt this approach may extend the learnings to other countries and health and sustainability challenges. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Successful upstream adult migration of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) from estuary to spawning grounds is critical to population recovery, especially during increasingly extreme droughts that degrade migratory habitat. In regulated systems, river confluences can pose significant navigation impediments given complex operational flow release criteria and other cumulative effects. Differing discharge magnitudes and ratios between tributaries may cause divergent confluence hydraulics and hydraulic microhabitat selectivity, influencing migratory routing. This study asks with respect to confluences: (1) Do magnitudes of discharge in each confluence tributary (and resulting combined discharge) influence availability of preferred hydraulic microhabitats in one river versus the other? (2) Does the ratio of discharge magnitudes influence availability of preferred hydraulic microhabitats in one river versus the other? We used data collected from California Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at the confluence of the Feather and Yuba Rivers as a model system to investigate. We combined observations of migratory behavioural responses to hydraulic microhabitats from dual-frequency identification sonars, spatially explicit, meter-resolution hydrodynamic modelling, and machine learning to generate a hydraulic microhabitat selectivity index and simulate upstream migratory pathways for nine pertinent discharge scenarios with four discharge ratios. Statistically significant (p < 0.01) differences in preferred hydraulic habitat were found among both discharge scenarios and ratios, with the Feather River selected in five out of nine scenarios. Discharge magnitude and ratio act as controls on distribution of preferred hydraulic microhabitats, and under certain conditions relevant to drought operations in this system, they can influence migratory routing and propensity of straying. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Introduction Type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence is rising, which imposes a significant burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and economies worldwide. Lifestyle factors contribute significantly to the escalating incidence of T2D. Consequently, there is an increasing need for interventions that not only target at-risk populations for prevention but also empower individuals with T2D to achieve better self-management and possibly attain remission through sustained lifestyle modifications. Technological tools may improve health outcomes compared to traditional in-person care, and can include registration of important health parameters, provide follow-up and support, and enhance self-management. The aim of this study was to receive feedback from end-users to inform the development of a comprehensive e-health program focusing on lifestyle modification in pre-diabetes and T2D. Methods During eight focus group meetings, sixteen adults with pre-diabetes or T2D from all over Norway informed the study about needs and preferences for an e-health program, including essential functionalities and design choices. A questionnaire and paper prototyping were used to complement the discussions in the focus group meetings. Results Lack of necessary diabetes knowledge was common, and education was considered essential for improved self-management. Essential functionalities included registration and overview of several health parameters, long-term follow-up and coaching through communication platforms within the program, automatic data transfer from different devices such as blood glucose monitors and smartwatches, and educational courses. To ensure end-users’ satisfaction with the program and increase motivation for long-term usage, the participants rendered tailoring of desired functionalities and content as crucial. Conclusion Based on the findings, a list of recommendations was created, containing the most crucial functionalities and features to include when developing e-health and/or m-health tools for people with pre-diabetes and T2D. Future work should include health care personnel to explore their needs and preferences, and ways such an e-health program may enhance patient interaction without increasing workload and resource use. © 2025 Rishaug et al.

To fill this gap, we employed the data from the 2018 Teaching and learning international survey to identify instructional profiles of Korean schoolteachers in relation to cognitive activation, the clarity of instruction, classroom management, and the use of enhanced activities. We then examined how teachers’ perceived self-efficacy, satisfaction with classroom autonomy, engagement in teacher collaboration, and school climate differed across each profile. A latent profile analysis revealed four distinct profiles: Laissez-faire, Controlling, Typical, and Versatile, primarily distinguished by the use of classroom management practices. First, Laissez-faire and Controlling teachers reported strong levels of self-efficacy in classroom management. Second, as satisfaction with classroom autonomy increased, the likelihood of belonging to the Controlling and Versatile profiles increased. Third, collaboration was the key to Versatile profile membership. Fourth, innovative instructional practices and a positive school climate were related. Finally, controlling membership was associated with a negative school climate and a low sense of efficacy in engaging students. These findings have important implications for professional development programs and policies in the Korean educational system. © Education Research Institute, Seoul National University 2023.},

Multiple policy update mechanisms are assessed, varying based on the frequency and length of updates and the action selection criteria. ARLEM is tested to control the energy performance of typical urban blocks in Madrid and Stockholm considering 17 future climate scenarios for 2040–2069. Each block contains 24 buildings of different types and ages. In Madrid, ARLEM is tested for a summer with two heatwaves and in Stockholm for a winter with two cold waves. Three performance indicators are defined to evaluate the effectiveness and resilience of different control approaches during extreme weather events. ARLEM demonstrates an ability to increase climate resilience in the studied blocks by increasing energy flexibility in the network and reducing both average and peak energy demands while affecting indoor thermal comfort marginally. Since the approach does not require any information about the system dynamics, it is easy to cope with the complexities of building systems and technologies, making it an affordable technology to control large urban areas with diverse types of buildings. © 2025},

	abstract = {Objective To design a virtual simulation experimental project for nursing of acute leukemia patients and explore its application effects. Methods From the perspective of students, a virtual simulation experimental project for nursing of acute leukemia patients was constructed, which including four modules:knowledge preview, virtual simulation practice mode, virtual simulation test mode, and experimental evaluation and feedback. The project involved six categories of response actions, namely, safety, communication, assessment, intervention, medication/intravenous management, and effect evaluation. The project was applied to the experimental teaching of leukemia for 78 undergraduate nursing students from the 2020 and 2021 grades at one university. After the teaching, students' training duration, number of visits, and experimental scores were collected. A self-designed questionnaire was used to invite students to evaluate the system and teaching effects. Results In the practice mode, students visited 3 (1, 5) times with an online training duration ranging from 29 to 346 [53(48, 132)] minutes, and the average practice score was (78.34±16.96) points. In the assessment mode, students scored (92.28±4.75) points with an exam duration of (45.09±5.23) minutes. Besides, 84.6%(66/78) of students rated "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the system overall, 78.2%(61/78) found the system "easy" or "very easy" to use, and 80.8%(63/78) considered the system "effective" or "very effective" in terms of effectiveness. Between 75.6% and 93.6% of students agreed that the virtual simulation experimental project had several positive teaching effects, including improving the ability to observe leukemia conditions, exercising clinical thinking in leukemia, enhancing nurse-patient communication skills, stimulating interest in learning about leukemia, improving leukemia nursing abilities and strengthening the spirit of humanistic care, and enhancing the level of related operational skills covered in the project. Conclusion The virtual simulation experimental project for nursing of acute leukemia patients is applicable and highly recognized by students for its effectiveness, laying a certain foundation of knowledge and skills for clinical practice in acute leukemia nursing. © 2025 Chinese Nursing Journals Publishing House.

	abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) integrate various dynamic energy sources, often making it challenging for traditional control techniques to manage these complexities. This study addresses key requirements faced by MG systems, particularly in the robust regulation of voltage and frequency (V/F) components. The proposed two-coating and layer control strategy aims to optimize MG operation effectively. To determine the coefficients for the power droop controller (PDC), a novel method called the hierarchical deep learning-based recurrent convolutional neural network (HDL-RCNN) is presented. This method incorporates feedback from system components and formats the measured data into a grid structure before inputting it into the RCNN platform. This formatting allows for the automatic extraction of temporal and spatial features crucial for V/F stability. The RCNN architecture includes several layers, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, convolutional layers, highly coupled layers, and other cascaded features. Results show significant improvements in voltage and frequency control: voltage oscillations in MG1 were reduced from 0.028pu to 0.004pu, and frequency fluctuations in MG2 decreased from 0.025pu to 0.007pu. Additionally, the method ensures the voltage stabilizes at 1pu, with minimal fluctuations, and provides robust performance across dynamic load changes and noisy conditions. These findings were validated through extensive testing on a MATLAB/Simulink platform, demonstrating the effectiveness of the HDL-RCNN in enhancing V/F stability and operational reliability in MGs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Featured Application: IntelliGrid AI revolutionizes smart home energy management by integrating blockchain, deep learning, and vehicle-to-home (V2H) technology, enabling optimized energy consumption, secure peer-to-peer energy trading, and adaptive scheduling. It demonstrated that 20% reduction in energy costs and scalability makes it ideal for renewable-powered communities and smart city applications. The integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles has become a focal point for industries and academia due to its profound economic, environmental, and technological implications. These developments require the development of a robust intelligent home energy management system (IHEMS) to optimize energy utilization, enhance transaction security, and ensure grid stability. For this reason, this paper develops an IntelliGrid AI, an advanced system that integrates blockchain technology, deep learning (DL), and dual-energy transmission capabilities—vehicle to home (V2H) and home to vehicle (H2V). The proposed approach can dynamically optimize household energy flows, deploying real-time data and adaptive algorithms to balance energy demand and supply. Blockchain technology ensures the security and integrity of energy transactions while facilitating decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. The core of IntelliGrid AI is an advanced Q-learning algorithm that intelligently allocates energy resources. V2H enables electric vehicles to power households during peak periods, reducing the strain on the grid. Conversely, H2V technology facilitates the efficient charging of electric cars during peak hours, contributing to grid stability and efficient energy utilization. Case studies conducted in Tunisia validate the system’s performance, showing a 20% reduction in energy costs and significant improvements in transaction efficiency. These results highlight the practical benefits of integrating V2H and H2V technologies into innovative energy management frameworks. © 2025 by the authors.},

Leveraging AIoT-driven image analysis will facilitate real-time visitor authentication and access control. However, the growing volume of interactions and the limited processing power of local terminals complicate the delivery of timely and accurate image analysis. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-terminal collaborative AIoT framework for real-time visitor management. The framework solves the limitations of traditional approaches, where local terminals are unable to handle the computational load and edge solutions experience high latency due to transmission delays. Specifically, it integrates three key components to improve system performance: a local analysis module for initial processing, an image communication module for efficient data transmission, and an edge analysis module for advanced processing. Moreover, the framework jointly optimizes image task offloading, wireless channel allocation, and image compression, all formulated as an optimization problem to ensure fast and accurate analysis. Additionally, a novel multi-level Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is further designed to dynamically refine the selection of compression and offloading strategies. By learning in real-time, the DRL model adapts to network variations, addressing the scalability and adaptability limitations of existing methods. Simulation results show that our proposed edge-terminal collaborative AIoT framework significantly outperforms both edge-only and terminal-only methods in terms of latency and accuracy. © 2025},

	abstract = {Background: Though an important component of high-quality healthcare, the routine collection of patient experience data is limited in primary care, as is the evidence for how this data is being used for quality improvement. This study used a learning health system (LHS) framework to describe how a university-affiliated community general practice is integrating patient experience data into service and quality improvement efforts, and to identify barriers and facilitators. Methods: A co-designed qualitative case study was conducted with academic researchers and staff from a university-affiliated general practice in Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in April 2024 with practice staff, and transcripts were deductively coded according to a five-domain learning health systems framework, and with additional codes capturing barriers and facilitators. Results: Eighteen (53%) practice staff were interviewed, including general practitioners (n = 11), a practice nurse (n = 1), and administrative staff (n = 6). Participants identified multiple methods through which the practice captured the patient experience that spanned all domains of the LHS framework. However, there was less evidence of a coherent quality improvement strategy being employed, with associated barriers identified around staff workloads, training, and existing government funding policies. Key facilitators to the use of patient experience data included: membership of a larger health organisation and university; key dedicated administrative and clinical roles; and effective leadership, governance structures and policies to support continuous learning and drive service improvement. Conclusion: This study presents a case example of how patient experience data is being integrated into general practice and identifies key barriers and facilitators to initiating and translating this data for continuous healthcare improvement. By mapping the use of patient experience data to a LHS framework, this study shows how LHS principles can be applied to primary care to facilitate the capture and use of patient experience data on an ongoing basis. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this article, the layout of table1, table 2 and boxes were incorrectly processed. These should appear as in this correction. The original article has been corrected. The SMARTer Greener Cities project gathered twelve researchers with diverse backgrounds and levels of seniority, (seven of which are co-authors of the manuscript), from five research institutions, situated in four countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, USA) (Table 2). Such structure and arrangement are common to projects in sustainability research, making it an instructive real-life case. The project was designed to be interdisciplinary with a work package dedicated to theoretical integration and synthesis across three different experimental case studies, each with a separate set of methods, objectives, and research leaders. The Social–Ecological–Technological Systems (SETS) framework was used to foster such integration. During the process, the team realised the need for an even softer and more inclusive method for integration before we could successfully apply the SETS framework across the case studies. From that point, the listening framework guided our collaboration and enabled us to connect insights across case studies, apply SETS with much more ease, and overcome the roadblocks. The aim of overcoming these roadblocks is to maintain the collaboration in an I/TD mode, providing greater integration, convergence and cross-communication than a mono-disciplinary or multidisciplinary mode of collaboration, as shown in Fig. 2. Each mode engages with the listening process to a different degree, shaping the amount of integration achieved and the time required, illustrated as increasingly greater overlap between the framework (open arrow circle) and individual disciplines (dark arrows). Awareness of these modes of collaboration brings clarity around their objectives and the various impediments to realising them. Participants naturally will engage in or move through different modes of collaborating at once, in a single meeting or partnership. In discussion, we explore how the practice of good listening can help a group stay more effectively in or return to the I/TD mode by balancing convergence with pluralism in ways that lead to exchange and enrichment, without necessitating consensus. One of the persistent roadblocks facing sustainability science is the question of who is in the room and feels able to participate. Missing voices—from different academic disciplines, educational, or cultural backgrounds; from people of diverse races, genders, ethnicities, and languages—limit the range, scope, and effectiveness of sustainability solutions. Moreover, being present is not the same as having a voice or being heard. All too often a limited spectrum of viewpoints and knowledges are present in sustainability science spaces. When care is taken to include more diverse perspectives it is not always followed by appropriate framing and organising the conversation to support the inclusion of diverse perspectives. While this challenge rests on the choices of individuals to convene and structure collaborations, it is also a deeply structural challenge. Ideas about what knowledge is, how and where it is produced, and who is involved are shaped and reinforced by systemic, identity-based inequalities, the structure of universities, the organisation and allocation of funding, and mechanisms of policy creation and implementation. While listening alone is not adequate to the task of dismantling structural, systemic hierarchies and inequalities, we believe it can help scholars and practitioners address some of the effects. First, Receiving, as the first step of good listening, asks us to open up and consider what is not being heard and to be curious about what signals we could pick up if we turned our attention to them. Second, Interpretation, as part of a framework for good listening, provides a guide for how to work across difference, acknowledging that not all signals will initially make sense. Rather than ignoring nonsensical voices, or requiring their revision to fit pre-determined formats, good listening urges us to examine our own values and assumptions with mindfulness, to reach for different mental models and new explanatory information with curiosity and cognitive complexity, and to engage in dialogue via being wrong with intellectual humility, asking questions and experimenting to find shared meaning with empathy, care and compassion. Finally, listening itself supports initiating collaboration. Framing first steps as listening can build trust and establish a space for curiosity and learning without the goal of reaching conclusions or solutions right away. Participation in academic collaborations to a large extent is pre-determined by project proposals. It was also true for the Smarter Greener Cities project (see Box 1) which aimed to achieve a balance in gender and seniority, in line with the listening framework attribute of inclusive participation. Work on nature-based solutions in cities transcends academic boundaries, therefore, guided by the curiosity of good listening, case study owners created local knowledge alliances and organised three living pavilions in three capital cities to expand the breadth of perspectives beyond the walls of the project and enable a channel for feedback. In one event, we emphasised the plurality of paths for achieving a goal of “listening to the voices of nature”, as promoted by the intellectual humility and cognitive complexity of good listening. Also, in line with empathy and compassion of good listening, these events redistributed the power of academic knowledge by giving a stage and more space to non-academic voices, such as artists, chefs, urban planners, city officials, psychologists and ecological entrepreneurs and facilitated more collaborations. Closely related to issues concerning who is in the room are those connected to group dynamics. Here, I/TD collaborations must contend with several challenges, including the outsize role and reliance on facilitators, management of personalities, and variation in individuals’ qualities as a participant. For example, there can be a tendency to rely on designated facilitators to do the work of listening and bridging, which can simultaneously overwhelm these individuals (frequently sustainability scientists themselves, not professional facilitators) and absolve participants of these responsibilities. There can also be dominant voices—due to length of experience, seniority, or identity—that risk drowning out younger or less empowered participants. Digital technologies can structure unequal participation platforms, as digital meetings make using non-verbal facilitation cues more challenging and hybrid forums may privilege in-person dialogue over inclusion of remote participants. Such disproportion can also result from individual qualities; some participants will have more comfort or experience “putting themselves out there” while others prefer more quiet, observational roles. Moreover, in sustainability science one might be coming to the collaboration with strong, individually held views regarding particular ideas or methods that motivate engagement. There are both individual and structural reasons for challenges related to group dynamics, and we find that our framework for good listening, which traverses a course from individual to structural considerations, to be useful. Once again, the framework itself can be used as a tool for structuring group processes (as discussed above), but is also a tool that can be given to individuals within the group to help guide them in how to participate. Receiving reiterates the importance of being present, caring and curious, and paying attention to where and how signals are being transmitted. Such an orientation can support collectively defining and performing roles, particularly with regard to facilitation, and support sensitive awareness with regards to digital or hybrid forms. Framing engagement in this way asks all to take part in facilitation. Loud voices are reminded to soften or to be silent to receive information, but also to be mindful about their power and predisposition to speak and are encouraged to practise intellectual humility. They are aware that by doing so they enhance the quality of the collaboration by unlocking creativity in the group, building trust and deeply human working relationships, increasing engagement and commitment to the initiative and more. Quiet voices are reminded that there are aspiring good listeners in the room who are open and curious toward a diversity of voices, who wish to gain a wider understanding and are willing to engage in Feedback if they do not initially understand. Under such light, sharing their perspective would be a gift. Building a collaboration on the strong foundation of the listening framework not only encourages quiet voices to speak and be heard but also to be more engaged and better integrated in the collaboration. Good listeners set the tone for more inclusive communication by decreasing the amount of judgement and bias while maximising creativity and supporting more complex thinking. Although the scope of the project was developed by a team of senior scholars it still gave opportunities for early career researchers to lead joint projects. Such freedom and flexibility aligns with the intellectual humility and care of good listening that redistributes leadership and widens perspectives. This was further supported by an exchange of postdocs who, due to the COVID pandemic, relied on digital means to collaborate. Their collaboration applied the SETS framework to combine smart and green cities agendas (Branny et al. 2022). However, it was a challenge to maintain and support high quality receiving, processing and interpretation, required for good listening. To address this challenge using the attributes of presence, curiosity and cognitive complexity, we incorporated regular check-ins, mindfulness exercises, and mixed and small group discussions in our meetings and workshops. Sustainability science frequently requires working across differences of theory, method, epistemology and ontology. To work with and in spite of these differences there is a need to embrace shared goals, methods and products, the definition of which is often a fraught process due to perceived incommensurabilities. For example, epistemological traditions, common in the arts, humanities, and certain social sciences, that locate knowledge in the experience of the particular are often perceived as at odds with ways of knowing, more common in other social sciences and natural sciences, based on the replicability and transportability of findings. If we are to take seriously recent insights that both approaches are needed in sustainability science, then new processes and formats are needed. We anticipate our framework for good listening to be helpful for guiding practitioners of sustainability science through a process of defining shared goals, methods, and outputs as well as pursuing understanding and overcoming perceived incommensurability. This begins with Receiving, wherein curiosity, openness, and a lack of defensiveness encourage actually taking in what another is communicating, which allows diverse knowledges to enter the collaboration. This is followed by Processing, and particularly the opportunity for group processing. Here, the work of translating, connecting, and contextualising can be made explicit and engaged collaboratively and iteratively, for the ultimate goal of a good listening process is mutual intelligibility, not being ‘correct’. In our example of epistemological difference, this collective processing would reframe the goal of exchange from integrating different ways of knowing to collectively rendering different epistemological arguments into something everyone can interpret and respond to intelligibly. This would further efforts toward ‘knowledge weaving’, where good listening is not yet fully recognised although it underpins all the stages from mobilisation to application (Tengö et al. 2017), and thus ultimately support a sustainability science that recognises and values different knowledges. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Emergency physicians play a central role in healthcare. They often must make quick and accurate decisions to save patients’ lives. Among the critical procedures they have to master is difficult airway management (DAM), a procedure required to establish and maintain a patient’s airway for adequate ventilation and oxygenation. To ensure optimal proficiency in DAM, the clinical skills that comprise this procedure must be regularly practiced and updated. However, traditional training approaches present significant organizational challenges in terms of time and cost. In response to these issues, we have developed an innovative education and training application employing immersive Virtual Reality (VR) for teaching basic to advanced DAM procedures, supported by an Adaptive Learning system. To evaluate the effectiveness of our DAM training system, we conducted experiments with a control group trained using traditional methods and two VR subgroups, one with and one without the Adaptive Learning component. Our results show that simulating the DAM procedure in VR is effective in improving students’ knowledge and produces comparable learning outcomes to traditional teaching methods. Interestingly, our study did not provide conclusive evidence that the adaptive design was superior to the non-adaptive one in terms of knowledge and acquisition of skills. However, it demonstrated greater efficiency, particularly in reducing training time. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Background: Appropriate support for the health of children with an intellectual disability by parents and healthcare professionals is pivotal, given the high risk of chronic conditions. However, there is limited research that has collected important insights from parents on their learnings for supporting their child's evolving healthcare needs. Aim: This study focuses on parents' experiences and learnings from managing and supporting the health of their child with intellectual disability. It aims to understand what parents wish they had known earlier, the essential knowledge and skills they needed to manage their child's health. Method: A qualitative study was carried out using semi-structured interviews with 21 parents of adolescents and young people with intellectual disability. The children had chronic health conditions that fell into six health domains, including (1) difficulties with movement and physical activity, (2) epilepsy, (3) dental care, (4) respiratory health and infection, (5) behaviour, mental health or sleep and (6) gastrointestinal health. Results: Thematic analysis yielded five themes: (1) optimising mutual engagement between healthcare professionals and families; (2) planning and practising effective healthcare; (3) having the right information at the right time; (4) finding the support that was needed and (5) navigating healthcare and disability systems. Over time, parents developed specific skills and knowledge for managing their child's health effectively. Some parents expressed regret for not seeking support and information about their child's health conditions earlier. Parents described how mutual engagement between healthcare professionals and parents optimised the management of their child's healthcare. Conclusion: The study found that managing the health of a child with intellectual disability is complex. The themes were consistent across health comorbidities, indicating important common experiences. The themes aligned with conceptualisations of health literacy, suggesting that improving health literacy skills can help parents better manage their children's health conditions. Patient or Public Contribution: We developed the project in consultation with members of the public who have lived experience of parenting a child with intellectual disability. They commented on the study aims, interview schedule, participant recruitment and provided feedback on the analysis and discussion. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are facing intensifying challenges, such as pollution, habitat destruction, and climate perturbations; hence, high-resolution, cost-effective monitoring tools are becoming increasingly important to provide timely and accurate data for effective conservation and management strategies. This review investigates the crucial role of unmanned vehicle systems (UVS) in conducting multi-spatial scale monitoring across different facets of aquatic ecosystems, including ecosystem habitat, algal bloom, vegetation conditions, and animal behaviors. Using a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review techniques, we assess UVS applications over the past decade (2013−2023), track research trends and evaluate the effectiveness, challenges, and prospects of UVS technologies. Our findings reveal a 12-fold increase in UVS applications in aquatic research during this period, with 60–70 % focusing on habitat monitoring and animal behavior research, and less than 10 % addressing algal blooms and eutrophication. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), representing 70 % of the published applications, have been the primary research instrument, outpacing Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles/Remotely Operated Vehicles (AUV/ROV). While enhancing monitoring at various scales with broad coverage, integrated applications between UAVs and USVs or AUVs/ROVs still need to solve crucial issues, such as weather impacts, communication complexities, and data processing needs. The systematic analysis highlights the gap in UVS applications for multi-spatial scale monitoring and reveals significant opportunities for integrating UVS with Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which are improving UVS integration, security, and efficiency, and enabling better resource management and navigation accuracy. Furthermore, object tracking, Digital Image Processing (DIP), Geographic Information System (GIS), and data management platforms enable efficient, multi-spatial scale monitoring and advanced research capabilities, offering the potential to enhance data collection and management of aquatic ecosystems. © 2024},

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, state and local mental health authorities rapidly developed and disseminated guidance to community mental health agencies. While tailored communication is effective to reach target audiences under usual circumstances, strategies to facilitate the implementation of guidance amidst a rapidly evolving public health emergency are not well understood. This project sought to understand factors informing decision-making about adaptations to guidance, and strategies used to disseminate and facilitate guidance implementation among system-level community partners in OnTrackNY Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs for early psychosis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with New York State Office of Mental Health (NYS OMH) state and local mental health authorities including state leaders (n = 3) and NYS OMH field office directors (n = 4), OnTrackNY program directors (n = 4), and leadership and trainers of an intermediary organization, OnTrack Central (n = 12). Interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Code reports relevant to guidance decision-making and dissemination were reviewed to identify emerging themes. For state and local mental health authorities, decision-making was influenced by changing COVID-19 risk levels, need for alignment between federal and local guidance, and balancing support for workforce capacity and mental health service continuity. For OnTrackNY program directors, decision-making was influenced by internal infrastructure and processes (e.g., program autonomy), availability of resources (e.g., technology), and perspective on managing risk and uncertainty (e.g., COVID-19, regulatory waiver expiration). For OnTrack Central, decision-making focused on balancing CSC model fidelity with OnTrackNY team capacity and resources. Dissemination of guidance consisted of mass and targeted strategies. Information flow was bidirectional such that top-down dissemination of guidance (e.g., from state mental health authorities to providers) was informed and refined with bottom-up feedback (e.g., from providers to state leadership) through surveys and professional forums (e.g., COVID-19 town halls, provider learning collaboratives). Unlike a planned approach to disseminate new policies, public health emergencies create variable landscapes that may warrant a deeper understanding of how guidance may be adapted to fit rapidly evolving community partner needs. Findings may inform efforts to identify processes that contribute to adaptation and dissemination of guidance for mental health during future public health emergencies. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of soil organic carbon (TOC) is crucial for assessing soil health, fertility, and ecosystem functions and services. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of various supervised learning models in comparison to neural networks for accurately capturing the complex relationships between soil attributes and TOC in soils under three wheat-based ecosystems (viz. wheat-rice/maize/cotton). The study aimed to identify the most robust and precise models for predicting TOC levels, with the ultimate goal of informing sustainable land management practices and improving soil fertility and health in agricultural systems. We evaluated the performance of eight supervised learning models viz. linear (LR), ridge (RR), lasso (LAR), elastic net (ENR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GBR) and support vector regression (SVR) vis-à-vis artificial neural networks (ANNs) for capturing the complex relationships between soil attributes and TOC in soils under three wheat-based ecosystems. These results revealed that the proportion of micro-aggregates (< 0.25 mm) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in soils under rice-wheat system, compared with the other systems which themselves did not differ significantly. However, there was a non-significant (p < 0.05) difference in the proportion of macro-aggregates (> 0.25 mm) amongst the compared wheat-based systems. The proportion of total water stable aggregates (WSA) was significantly higher by ~ 13.1–18.7% for maize-wheat, compared with other systems. Maize-wheat soils exhibited ~ 21.6% reduction in dehydrogenase (DHA) activity as compared to rice-wheat soils. However, cotton-wheat soils exhibiting ~ 28.8% decrease in alkaline-P (Alk-P) activity, compared with rice-wheat soils. These results indicate that ANN8 − 15−1−1 model consisting of Tansig activation function and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm exhibited superior performance in accurately predicting TOC levels. Model (ANN8 − 15−1−1) validation of a comprehensive data-set underscored its robustness and precision with mean squared error (MSE) values of 1.055E-13, 4.950E-11 and 5.561E-03 for training, validation, and testing data-sets, respectively. Nonetheless, high values of the correlation coefficient (R; 0.9964**, 0.9845**, and 0.9989**; p < 0.01, respectively), underscored the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between soil attributes and agricultural practices. Amongst the various supervised learning models evaluated, DT model outperformed, exhibiting the highest coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.997** (p < 0.01). These findings highlight the importance of employing advanced modeling techniques, e.g., ANN and supervised learning algorithms for precise prediction of TOC concentration in agricultural soils. These insights have significant implications for sustainable land management practices, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions regarding soil fertility and health, thereby contributing to the mitigation of land degradation and climate change impacts. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo 2024.},

	abstract = {Queueing modeling is essential for enhancing battery management technologies, including battery swapping destinations, charging station management, and renewable energy management systems. The present study offers an in-depth analysis of queue-based stochastic modeling for the electric vehicle (EV) industries, extending the previous investigations. This investigation proposes three distinctive stochastic models: a single-server finite capacity queueing model, appropriate for smaller charging stations however restricted by its single-server assumption; a multiple-server finite capacity queueing model, more advantageous for larger stations while still presuming an infinite population; and a finite capacity and finite population queueing model, appropriate for circumstances with a predetermined number of individuals, although slightly more complex to analyze. The corresponding differential-difference equations for each developed model are formulated and examined, taking into account both transient and steady-state behaviors. Closed mathematical expressions of various system performance measurements are demonstrated for each established model to provide a comprehensive statistical overview. Additionally, to highlight the robustness of the finite population queueing model, several illustrations in terms of different graphs and tables are provided and emphasized with the help of an in-depth investigation for comparison purposes. The significant outcomes of the investigation indicate that integrating finite population considerations substantially enhances the accuracy of waiting time predictions, especially during peak demand intervals, in comparison to models that assume infinite populations. This research emphasizes the significance of model selection according to particular application constraints and presents essential managerial insights, such as optimal resource allocation, dynamic pricing strategies, and load balancing techniques, to assist system analysts and decision-makers. Concluding remarks and potential future perspectives are also included, with an emphasis on integrating cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, etc. to enhance adaptive management and model prediction. © 2025 The Author(s)},

Multiple definitions of “information avoidance” exist, and key aspects of these definitions deserve attention, such as distinguishing information avoidance from (lack of) information seeking, considering the intentionality and temporal nature of information avoidance, and considering the personal relevance of the information. In this review, we provide a cross-disciplinary historical account of theories and empirical research on information avoidance and seeking, drawing from research in multiple fields. We provide a framework of antecedents of information avoidance, categorized into beliefs about the information (e.g., risk perceptions), beliefs about oneself (e.g., coping resources), and social and situational factors (e.g., social norms), noting that constructs across categories overlap and are intertwined. We suggest that research is needed on both positive and negative consequences of information avoidance and on interventions to reduce information avoidance (when appropriate). Research is also needed to better understand temporal dynamics of information avoidance and how it manifests in everyday life. Finally, comprehensive theoretical models are needed that differentiate avoidance from seeking. Research on information avoidance is quickly expanding, and the topic will only grow in importance. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {This study compares the efficacy of machine learning models to traditional biophysical models in predicting rectal (Tre) and skin (Tsk) temperatures of older adults (≥60 years) during prolonged heat exposure. Five machine learning models were trained on data using 4-fold cross validation from 162 day-long (8–9h) sessions involving 76 older adults across six environments, from thermoneutral to heatwave conditions. These models were compared to three biophysical models: the JOS-3 model, the Gagge two-node model, and an optimised two-node model. Our findings show that machine learning models, particularly ridge regression, outperformed biophysical models in prediction accuracy. The ridge regression model achieved a Root-Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.27 °C for Tre, and 0.73 °C for Tsk. Among the best biophysical models, the optimised two-node model achieved an RMSE of 0.40 °C for Tre, while JOS-3 achieved an RMSE of 0.74 °C for Tsk. Of all models, ridge regression had the highest proportion of participants with Tre RMSEs within clinically meaningful thresholds at 70% (<0.3 °C) and the highest proportion for Tsk at 88% (<1.0 °C), tied with the JOS-3 model. Our results suggest machine learning models better capture the complex thermoregulatory responses of older adults during prolonged heat exposure. The study highlights machine learning models' potential for personalised heat risk assessments and real-time predictions. Future research should expand upon training datasets, incorporate more dynamic conditions, and validate models in real-world settings. Integrating these models into home-based monitoring systems or wearable devices could enhance heat management strategies for older adults. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) improve battery management in electric vehicles (EVs) by enhancing the safety, durability, and reliability of electrochemical batteries, particularly through improvements in the State of Charge (SOC) estimation. EV batteries operate under demanding conditions, which can affect performance and, in extreme cases, lead to critical failures such as thermal runaway—an exothermic chain reaction that may result in overheating, fires, and even explosions. Addressing these risks requires advanced diagnostic and management strategies, and machine learning presents a powerful solution due to its ability to adapt across multiple facets of battery management. The versatility of ML enables its application to material discovery, model development, quality control, real-time monitoring, charge optimization, and fault detection, positioning it as an essential technology for modern battery management systems. Specifically, ANN models excel at detecting subtle, complex patterns that reflect battery health and performance, crucial for accurate SOC estimation. The effectiveness of ML applications in this domain, however, is highly dependent on the selection of quality datasets, relevant features, and suitable algorithms. Advanced techniques such as active learning are being explored to enhance ANN model performance by improving the models’ responsiveness to diverse and nuanced battery behavior. This compact survey consolidates recent advances in machine learning for SOC estimation, analyzing the current state of the field and highlighting the challenges and opportunities that remain. By structuring insights from the extensive literature, this paper aims to establish ANNs as a foundational tool in next-generation battery management systems, ultimately supporting safer and more efficient EVs through real-time fault detection, accurate SOC estimation, and robust safety protocols. Future research directions include refining dataset quality, optimizing algorithm selection, and enhancing diagnostic precision, thereby broadening ANNs’ role in ensuring reliable battery management in electric vehicles. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Autonomous vehicles utilise sensors, control systems and machine learning to independently navigate and operate through their surroundings, offering improved road safety, traffic management and enhanced mobility. This paper details the development, software architecture and simulation of control algorithms for key functionalities in a model that approaches Level 2 autonomy, utilising MATLAB Simulink and IPG CarMaker. The focus is on four critical areas: Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Detection (LD) and Traffic Object Detection. Also, the integration of low-level PID controllers for precise steering, braking and throttle actuation, ensures smooth and responsive vehicle behaviour. The hardware architecture is built around the Nvidia Jetson Nano and multiple Arduino Nano microcontrollers, each responsible for controlling specific actuators within the drive-by-wire system, which includes the steering, brake and throttle actuators. Communication between these components is facilitated through the CAN protocol, which ensures accurate and reliable data transfer essential for real-time decision-making. AEB achieves precise emergency braking and enhances driver comfort through the use of PID controllers, while ACC leverages radar data to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. LD employs the Hough Transform algorithm for accurate road edge detection. Furthermore, a trained neural network within the system identifies and responds to traffic signals, signage, pedestrians and vehicles. The camera interfaces directly with the Jetson Nano, while radar data is shared with the IMU through a dedicated CAN bus. This integrated approach represents a significant advancement in autonomous vehicle control, thus contributing to enhanced safety, comfort and reliability for both drivers and passengers. This software architecture is designed based on aBaja 2024 competition and according to its rules, regulations, requirements and specifications, the controllers and simulations were designed.  © 2025 SAE International.

In such a setup, the PV system generates electricity, which can be used immediately, stored in batteries, or fed into the grid. The challenge lies in dynamically optimizing the power flow between these components to minimize energy costs, maximize the use of renewable energy, and maintain grid stability. Reinforcement learning (RL) combined with NNs offers a powerful solution by enabling the system to learn and adapt its energy management strategy in real time. By using the proposed techniques, the convergence time was decreased with lower complexity compared with existing approaches. The RL agent interacts with the environment (i.e., the grid, PV system, and battery), continuously improving its decisions regarding when to store energy, draw from the battery, and supply power to the grid. This intelligent control approach ensures optimal performance, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient energy system. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Depression and neurological disorders together can have a very negative effect on a person's life. The good news is that there is a workable solution in the form of bio-inspired algorithms and machine-learning models. To more accurately diagnose depression and other neurological disorders, scientists combine data from behavioural hints, linguistic patterns, and physiological indicators with information from biological systems like brain networks and genetic algorithms. Utilizing machine learning models like Decision Trees, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), and Naive Bayes can lead to a thorough detection and understanding of mental health concerns. With the use of these state-of-the-art techniques, neurological disease patients can receive a more personalized and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management. It offers an early diagnostic and treatment approach for neurological illnesses based on data-centric prediction, which can improve patient outcomes and raise living standards for millions of people globally. This strategy is useful in recognizing early symptoms of depression and allowing for intervention before the disease develops, as demonstrated by empirical study and validation. A major advancement in neuroscience has been made possible by combining machine learning methods and bio-inspired algorithms, which opens new avenues for the early detection and treatment of neurological conditions. With individualized care, improved results, and a higher standard of living for people with neurological illnesses, we can all work together to build a more positive and health-conscious society. © 2025 Balasubramaniam S, Seifedine Kadry, Manoj Kumar T K and K.

	abstract = {The work delves into the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as the critical aspect of quality control in manufacturing for the automated detection and classification of weld defects in Weld components. Weld defects, which encompass various inconsistencies such as corrosion, burn through, and misalignments, can significantly impact the structural integrity and performance of welded parts. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error, which often results in inconsistent and unreliable defect detection. Leveraging the capabilities of CNNs, this study aims to enhance the precision, efficiency, and reliability of weld defect detection processes. By utilizing a robust dataset comprising thousands of high-resolution images of welds, meticulously labeled for different defect types, the CNN model is trained to identify and classify these defects with high accuracy. The integration of IoT systems for real-time image capture and analysis further underscores the potential for CNN-based systems to revolutionize quality assurance in manufacturing by providing immediate feedback and enabling proactive defect management. The paper contains a detailed approach, beginning with the collection and preprocessing of a diverse dataset to train the CNN model, then testing of real weld pieces against the model and what the results imply. The CNN architecture is designed to effectively capture and analyze the patterns associated with different weld defects. Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and loss demonstrates the model's efficacy, achieving a significant improvement over traditional inspection methods. Future work will focus on the study also explores the practical implications of deploying CNN-based defect detection systems in settings, highlighting the possible benefits in terms of cost savings and reduced reliability further refining the model through techniques such as transfer learning and expanding its application to other types of defects and metals, helping to expand the way for broader adoption of AI-driven quality control solutions. © 2025 Author(s).},

Effective management of on-street parking is critical in addressing traffic congestion and promoting environmental sustainability. This study presents a machine learning model that leverages complex spatiotemporal dependencies and incorporates essential exogenous factors to accurately predict on-street parking availability. Our approach employs a combination of graph representations-static, dynamic time-warping, and hidden state-generated graphs-to capture distinct aspects of urban parking dynamics. An attention-based fusion mechanism integrates these graphs into a cohesive dynamic graph, providing a refined understanding of parking behavior. The inclusion of external temporal features through advanced gated recurrent units enhances the model's predictive accuracy. Rigorous testing on real datasets demonstrates the model's superior performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.0379 and a mean square error of 0.0067, thereby surpassing existing benchmarks. Our results highlight the model's efficacy as a decision-support tool for urban planners and policymakers, facilitating the development of more efficient and sustainable transport systems. Additionally, the model's interpretability and adaptability make it a valuable tool for better understanding the intricate dynamics of urban parking. We further explore the effects of prediction accuracy and the availability of predictive information on the efficiency of the parking search process, emphasizing the critical role of accurate and timely parking data in minimizing cruising time and enhancing urban mobility. © 2025},

	abstract = {Background Since 2012, China has had one degreed undergraduate programme in global health for domestic students. The International Health Project Management course is a core component of this programme's curriculum, bridging theoretical knowledge to practice in global health engagement. This study aims to evaluate whether introducing a teamwork and role-play module would meet the learning objectives, including improving students' perception of global health, enhancing their understanding of the management processes for global health projects, and eventually developing competencies for effective global health involvement. Methods The teamwork role-play module was used in a scenario assuming that all students played a specific role in project management in the € Health System Enhancement for Pandemic Preparedness in Southeast and South Asian Countries' programme. This programme called for proposals to implement a project in at least one country in Southeast or South Asia. We conducted a content analysis using two types of materials from the students: (1) concept note and proposal presentations and (2) students' responses to the open-question feedback survey with four questions. Results Students addressed the colonial origins of global health and its evolving definition, emphasising the need for a broader interdisciplinary approach. They perceived China's role in global health as evolving from a recipient to a donor, collaborator or participator, with a focus on enhancing soft power. However, their inadequate background knowledge of global health issues hindered their ability to undertake the tasks in depth. Students provided positive feedback on the teamwork with the role-play module, highlighting improved efficiency, broader and deeper learning through communication, increased participation, etc. Challenges such as poor leadership in teamwork, communication breakdowns and unequal workload distribution were identified. Conclusions Students showed a comprehensive understanding of managing a global health project through their teamwork tasks. Introducing teaching assistants to support teamwork, providing more hands-on opportunities, and integrating a broader range of disciplines into the curriculum will be crucial for the continued development of effective global health education programmes.  © 2025 BMJ Publishing Group.

Furthermore, a probabilistic diagnosis is produced for each scan, offering a personalized diagnosis that in turn indicates the severity of the disease, if exist, for each individual independently. Accordingly, the proposed methodology consists of three main steps: (1) the X-ray scans of three groups (i.e., normal, Osteopenia, and Osteoporosis) are pre-processed to improve the scans’ quality, and to serve the feature extraction and the construction of the model; (2) the pre-trained VGG16 model is used to identify the descriminative characteristics of each studied group that are then; at stage (3) fed to the SVM classifier to accomplish the diagnosis task, including the severity grading task. Results: Evaluating the proposed framework showed promising results with an average overall accuracy of 94.85%. In the groups base, the results were around 93.75%, 96.77%, and 100% for the normal group's recall, F1-score, and precision, respectively. For the Osteopenia group, the results were around 93.95%, 100%, and 88.60% for F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively. Finally, the Osteoporosis group's results achieved an average of 93.91%, 90%, and 98% for F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively. Conclusion: These results reflect the powerful ability of the proposed work especially that it could outperform the related efforts. Accordingly, these results encourage further analysis to extract more related medical insights for consequent assistance in the relevant healthcare diagnosis and treatment plans. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Historically, junior professionals have mentored senior professionals around new technologies, because juniors are typically more willing than seniors to perform lower-level tasks to learn new skills, better able than seniors to engage in real-time experimentation close to the work itself, and more willing than seniors to learn innovative methods that conflict with traditional identities and norms. However, we know little about what happens when emerging technologies have a high level of uncertainty in their use, because they have wide-ranging capabilities and are exponentially changing. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, specifically learning algorithms and LLMs, such contexts may be increasingly common. In our study conducted with the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we interviewed 78 junior consultants in July–August 2023 who had recently participated in a field experiment that gave them access for the first time to generative AI (GPT-4) for a strategic business problem solving task. Drawing from junior professionals' in situ reflections soon after the experiment, we found that junior professionals may fail to manage risks around uncertain emerging technologies because juniors are likely to recommend three kinds of novice risk work tactics that: 1) are grounded in a lack of deep understanding of technologies that have uncertain and wide-ranging capabilities and are changing exponentially, 2) focus on change to human routines rather than system design, and 3) focus on interventions at the project-level rather than system deployer- or ecosystem-level. The implications of novice risk work are that, when junior professionals are expected to be a source of expertise in the use of uncertain, emerging technologies, this can lead to learning failures. This study contributes to our understanding of occupational learning around emerging technologies, risk work in organizations, and human-computer interaction. © 2025},

	abstract = {Effective safety training plays an important part in safety management on construction sites. Construction workers safety and safety training education remain to be the main issues in the construction industry, as current practices rely on traditional methods. These methods often lack classroom interaction, hindering active worker engagement and fail to accommodate diverse learning paces and styles. To enhance safety awareness among workers, there is a need for a more effective system for safety training programs within the construction industry. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively analyse an experimental intervention using flipped learning to reduce costs and enhance learning outcomes in construction safety training. Flipped learning transforms traditional classroom learning by introducing students to web-based videos, presentations, and readings before class, freeing up in-class time for discussions and problem-solving. An intervention study was carried out to confirm the effectiveness of flipped learning approach within the construction industry. In this study, 40 personnel from a leading construction firm in Pakistan underwent safety training, with 20 following the traditional method and the remaining 20 following the proposed flipped model. The final quiz revealed a score increase from 27.9 to 31.5 in flipped learning, indicating a 12.90% increase. Based on these findings, it is suggested that adopting the flipped learning approach leads to better learning outcomes within the construction industry, as workers can pause, rewind, and replay the lectures at their leisure. This not only makes safety training more accessible but also enhances on-site safety in a cost-effective manner. © 2025 The Author(s).},

Built on transformer architectures, LLMs excel at text generation and data analysis, enabling applications such as automated energy model generation, energy management optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis. These models can potentially streamline complex workflows, enhance decision-making, and improve energy efficiency. However, integrating LLMs into building energy systems poses challenges, including high computational demands, data preparation costs, and the need for domain-specific customization. This perspective paper explores the role of LLMs in the building energy system sector, highlighting their potential applications and limitations. We propose a development roadmap built on in-context learning, domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation, and multimodal integration to enhance LLMs’ customization and practical use in this field.

Electricity consumption forecasts are divided into short-term and long-term, but previous studies have focused more on the former, while the latter is the foundation of power system planning and directly relates to urban development. To address the issue, this research proposed an innovative hybrid Hausdorff fractional grey model (HfGM) for electricity consumption prediction, weakening buffer operator (WBo) was incorporated to minimize interference of external shocks to original data, the optimal core parameters of HfGM were searched by a newly developed multi-objective enhanced version of slime mould algorithm in two stages, achieving Pareto optimal solutions theoretically. Experiments results demonstrated the proposed model outperformed comparative models, leading to its application in predicting electricity consumption trends in China during the 15th Five-Year Plan period and assessing the corresponding environmental impacts. Beyond advancing grey model theory, the research provides essential policy recommendations for integrating environmental management into electricity demand planning, assisting policymakers in addressing demand growth and supporting carbon reduction goals. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

Traditional tools are often incompatible with the hardware available at MPS. Online platforms, though helpful for bypassing installation issues, often lack essential classroom management features. To resolve this, ECS-WL integrates Firebase for real-time database management and Gmail-based login; CodeMirror for a coding environment with syntax highlighting and line numbering; and Dompurify for HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks. The tool features a directory system and a website creator to access starter code, retrieve saved code, and save/submit assignments, streamlining the daily submission process. The curriculum was adjusted to align with the tool, emphasizing clear daily instructions and incorporating students' interests through culturally responsive projects. Enhancements include error detection, a requirement for linking CSS, support for creating multi-page websites, and a notification system to track student progress. Five teachers and 242 students used the ECS-WL tool in this initial unit pilot, resulting in 755 unique webpage submissions. Assessments showed diverse student projects. Teacher feedback indicated needed improvements in curriculum presentation, classroom management features, and student engagement. The updated website from feedback includes adding features for teachers to edit daily instructions, hide days, distinguish classes, and enable group work. These enhancements aim to make the curriculum more manageable and engaging, fostering creativity and practical web development skills. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {To improve intersection traffic flow and reduce vehicle energy consumption and emissions at intersections, a signal optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. The algorithm uses Rainbow DQN as the core framework, incorporating vehicle position, speed, and acceleration information into the state space. The reward function simultaneously considers two objectives: reducing vehicle waiting times and minimizing carbon emissions, with the vehicle queue length as a weighted factor. Additionally, an ACmix module, which integrates self-attention mechanisms and convolutional layers, is introduced to enhance the model’s feature extraction and information representation capabilities, improving computational efficiency. The model is tested using an actual intersection as the study object, with a signal intersection simulation built in SUMO. The proposed approach is compared with traditional Webster signal timing, actuated signal timing, and control strategies based on DQN and D3QN models. The results show that the proposed strategy, through real-time signal timing adjustments, reduces the average vehicle waiting time by approximately 27.58% and the average CO2 emissions by about 7.34% compared with the actuated signal timing method. A comparison with DQN and D3QN models further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model, achieving a 15% reduction in average waiting time and a 6.5% reduction in CO2 emissions. The model’s applicability is validated under various scenarios, including different proportions of electric vehicles and traffic volumes. This study aims to provide a flexible signal control strategy to enhance intersection vehicle flow and reduce carbon emissions. It offers a reference for the development of green, intelligent transportation systems and holds practical significance for promoting urban carbon reduction efforts. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As professional learning and development (PLD) for teachers moves online, it is increasingly important to consider what constitutes effective provision. While models of effective PLD abound, online PLD faces challenges to participant engagement. In particular, the critical need to build and maintain relationships in professional learning is complicated by the geographic and temporal distribution of online participants as well as the nuances of the technology in use. We argue that online PLD occurs in collaborative text-spaces within learning management systems, social media spaces and their attendant learning objects such as forums. As such, persistent challenges to engagement in online PLD may be met by considering the language-based interpersonal affordances of these text-spaces. We employ a small-scale corpus study and appraisal analysis to demonstrate the value of Systemic Functional Linguistics in addressing the challenges of online learning, particularly how the meaning making resources of the interpersonal metafunction can be used to improve participant engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Accurate identification of Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is important for disaster prevention and management. Traditional MCSs identification methods are based on temperature and area thresholds. These methods are highly accurate for MCSs identification, but consume large computational resources. Deep learning models have made significant progress in the field of object identification. However, existing deep learning models do not take into account the characteristics of excessive differences in MCSs area coverage and uneven spatial distribution. Direct application of these models to this task may lead to the problems of missed identification of small MCSs and ambiguous identification of MCSS boundaries. In this paper, we construct a MCSs recognition dataset and propose a Multiscale Feature Enhancement Network (MFE-Net) for identifying MCSs. This model consists of two main modules: Feature Alignment Distribution Module (FADM) and Asymmetric Feature Recovery Module (AFRM). The FADM, which is used to aggregate multiscale information during the downsampling phase, aims to improve the perception of small-scale MCSs and prevent them from being lost during the downsampling process of the model. AFRM is designed to extract and preserve spatial edge features of MCSs from different spatial dimensions and accurately identify the edges of MCSs. The experimental results show that our MFE-Net achieves excellent performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

A novel expert-guided RL (EGRL) paradigm is proposed, combining deep ensemble methods with a digital expert model (DEM) for real-time EMS intervention across various scenarios. DEM, trained via domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), adapts to different driving conditions. An intervention mechanism, based on uncertainty evaluation in the deep ensemble, allows DEM to guide and supervise RL training, ensuring reliability. The EMS optimizes energy consumption, battery health, and electricity maintenance for the range-extended electric bus (REEB) system. Simulation results show the paradigm significantly improves energy management, nearing optimal performance and surpassing traditional RL methods. EGRL achieves an average 15.8% improvement in economic benefit across all test cycles.

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Engagement in internal quality improvement (QI) within physician practices is a key avenue by which to deliver evidence-based and patient-centered care, but it can be difficult to sustain such engagement. Consequently, research is needed that identifies organizational factors associated with sustained internal QI. We utilized two waves of a national survey of physician practices to explore whether organizational innovation characteristics including organizational culture, health information technology (HIT) capacity, and Accountable Care Organization (ACO) affiliation distinguish physician practices that sustain their engagement in internal QI from those that do not. Methods: We linked two waves of the National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems (NSHOS) fielded between 2017-2018 and 2022–2023 among physician practices in the United States to assess organizational characteristics associated with sustained engagement in QI (n = 714 practices). Our final regression models incorporate survey and nonresponse weights and control for practice size and ownership. Results: We found that higher innovative culture scores were associated with almost three times the odds of sustained QI (OR = 2.91, p < 0.001). Although high HIT capacity was also associated with greater odds of sustained versus non-sustained QI across both survey waves, this finding was not statistically significant (OR = 1.11, p > 0.05). We did not find statistically significant support for our final hypothesis that ACO affiliation (whether commercial, Medicare, or Medicaid) was associated with sustained internal QI (OR = 1.26, p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our study is the first to our knowledge to underscore the critical importance of innovative organizational culture to sustaining internal QI among physician practices. Although ACO affiliation may signal willingness to participate in QI as a means to advance evidence- and value-based care and HIT capacity may facilitate improvement activities, these characteristics may not assure sustained internal QI engagement without an organizational culture aligned with QI. Practice implications: Policies that advance organizational capacity to develop a learning-oriented innovative culture could enable sustained QI engagement at the physician practice level. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Despite the collective promise of integrating more open (broader-based, participatory) city-level governance into the global energy governance regime, little attention has been paid to the different impact logics and assumptions underpinning local procedural governance tools (PGTs) in circulation and the degree to which they address key good governance dimensions dominantly thought to be indicative of transformation. This review aims to fill this gap by mapping and analyzing key energy transition PGTs circulating across four climate action initiatives that mobilize and provide support to cities and local governments. A framework—REPAIR: Reflexivity, Enabling/Embedding, Participatory, Integrative, Adaptive, and Radicality—is proposed based on a synthesis of common governance innovation design features, and a representative sample of 25 PGTs are evaluated against these dimensions. The analysis reveals a need for (1) more differentiation and tailored capacity relating to governance monitoring, evaluating, and learning systems; (2) more attention to prioritization and design factors across different governance interventions in relation to local climate actions; and (3) more nuanced theories of change for operationalizing local power/coalition/mandate building (across different dimensions of governance). This article concludes that there are real gaps in how the collective advantages, opportunities, and promise of traveling “ideal types” of good governance will be fulfilled and outlines future research directions for informing more aligned governance innovation for low-carbon transitions in urban areas. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is a Veterans Affairs (VA) priority. Colonoscopy quality, especially adenoma detection rate (ADR), is critical for effective screening. Our research indicates considerable variation in ADR among VA providers. Even a slight increase in ADR can reduce fatal CRC rates, and audit and feedback strategies have improved ADR in other settings. A recent report identified deficiencies in VA colonoscopy quality, highlighting the need for standardized documentation and reporting. To address this, we developed the VA Endoscopy Quality Improvement Program (VA-EQuIP), which aims to improve colonoscopy quality through benchmarking and collaborative learning, aligning with VA's modernization priorities and HSR&D and QUERI goals of accelerating evidence-based implementation. Methods: We will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate whether VA-EQuIP improves provider ADR compared to usual care, the implementation of VA-EQuIP, site-level factors associated with colonoscopy quality improvement, and components of provider behavior change. Using mixed methods our study will measure outcomes like reach, implementation, adoption, maintenance of VA-EQuIP, and provider behavior change. The analysis will include primary and secondary outcomes, such as overall and screening ADR, cecal intubation rate, and bowel preparation quality, using mixed effects generalized linear models and interrupted time-series analyses. Adoption and implementation will be evaluated through usage statistics, surveys, and qualitative interviews to identify factors influencing success. Discussion: This study will assess the impact of VA-EQuIP on colonoscopy quality metrics and factors associated with effective implementation. VA-EQuIP infrastructure allows for national-scale implementation and evaluation of quality reporting with minimal manual labor, guiding future quality improvement efforts to ensure optimal patient care. © 2024},

Thus, this paper aims to investigate the association between feedback strategies, embedded course syllabus and learning improvement in the Sakai Learning Management System. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a survey design to collect cross-sectional data from adult distance learning students. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a standard multiple regression model in Stata. Findings: The results show that feedback strategies (timing, mode, quality and quantity) and embedded course syllabus have a significant relationship with learning improvement. However, the feedback strategy – target – is not significantly related to learning improvement though it is the highest feedback strategy. Originality/value: This paper has contributed to the extant literature by providing empirical evidence to support the constructivism theory of learning from a distance learning perspective in a developing country. The study has shown that if the feedback strategies are well managed and applied, they would make a considerable impact on distance education students' academic pursuits. Hence, the paper provides a pedagogical foundation for short and long-term distance learning policy. © 2023, Esther Julia Korkor Attiogbe, Yaw Oheneba-Sakyi, O.A.T.F. Kwapong and John Boateng.},

Results: Of the 362 articles screened, thirteen were deemed appropriate for this review. Themes explored from the results were multimodal feedback approaches, faculty proficiency in technology, timely feedback practices, content of feedback, and student engagement in feedback. Conclusions: Nurse faculty members who are well-educated on best practices of providing formative feedback to students in an online setting are best equipped to mentor and teach students in modern academic settings. Audiovisual feedback is well received by students and promotes connectedness between students and faculty. Technological tools in the learning management system, such as screen capture recordings and tracking feedback clicks, may be useful in providing feedback in the online setting. Student engagement with feedback and the level of student feedback literacy were found to be important aspects of the feedback process. Future research should focus on student feedback literacy and the use of artificial intelligence in faculty-to-student feedback. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The application of the internet in learning is known as e-learning. Unfortunately, e-learning is often criticized for its effectiveness. This study aims to determine the effectiveness for implementing interactive video with H5P plugins to improve students' understanding in the Ordinary Differential Equations Subject. To conduct this study, a mixed research method was chosen. First, ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) model development research is used to obtain valid interactive videos on exact and non-exact equation materials which can increase student understanding. Second, quasi-experimental research is carried out by setting class B as an experimental class while class C as a control class. Based on the quiz score from both classes, the effectiveness of the treatment is determined by using the effect size formula. The results of this study are interactive videos that have the features of providing direct feedback, assuring mastery of concepts, informing students' learning processes, and applicability. The treatment in the experiment class showed that interactive videos significantly influence student’s quiz scores. Furthermore, the effectiveness of giving interactive videos relates to students' understanding was categorized as very high. In conclusion, the combination of H5P and moodle-based elearning can be applied to provide various learning experiences and improve the quality of learning. © 2025 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Introduction Civilian healthcare workers (HCW) and medical facilities are directly and indirectly impacted by armed conflict. In the Russia-Ukraine war, acute trauma care needs grew, the workforce was destabilised by HCW migrating or shifting roles to meet conflict needs, and facilities faced surge events. Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) exposure risks created unique preparedness needs. In response, an academic and international non-governmental organisation partnership was formed to design, implement and evaluate a locally prioritised training programme in Ukraine. Methods Seven in-person training courses (Advanced Trauma Life Support, Trauma Nursing Fundamentals, Pediatric Trauma Fundamentals, Prehospital Trauma Fundamentals, Stop the Bleed, Mass Casualty Management and CBRNE Preparedness) were adapted, translated, taught and evaluated in seven Ukrainian oblasts (regions; Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Lviv, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv) during the war. Topics were determined by available needs assessments and further adapted based on course participant feedback and evolving logistic and security challenges. Change in participant knowledge and confidence levels was assessed through precourse and postcourse knowledge and self-confidence evaluations and follow-up surveys. Initial courses were taught by international instructors and transitioned to Ukrainian instructors as they were trained. Web-based asynchronous videos in Ukrainian were developed to complement and reinforce in-person training. Results 4368 participants were trained in 164 courses from August 2022 to April 2023. 223 instructors were trained. Aggregate participant knowledge and self-confidence significantly improved in all courses. Interval follow-up responses indicated that the training was useful and 83.3% had used the skills within 8 weeks of training. Twenty-seven training videos were created which, as of April 2023, have been viewed over 1 700 000 times in 500 cities throughout Ukraine. Conclusions Locally prioritised training can be rapidly developed and delivered in an armed conflict setting providing civilians and frontline HCW with the skills and knowledge required to care for patients. Logistics, communication, equipment and security challenges can be overcome through strategic in-country partnerships. Short asynchronous video learning can complement and scale in-person training.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ Group.},

	abstract = {Background: Traditionally, ward placements have been utilized for nursing students to refine their management skills before registration. Whilst intensive care units (ICUs) offer unique learning opportunities, they are underutilized for student practice, and limited research has examined ICUs as conducive environments for developing management skills. Aim: This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of nursing students during their final-year placement in critical care. Study Design: An inductive methodology was employed to explore the complexities of being a final-year nursing student in critical care setting. Ten students were recruited between September 2019 and February 2020. Data were collected using individual, face-to-face semi-structured interviews before the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data. Results: Three themes were identified: barriers to learning, empowering transformation and a state of readiness. All the nursing students valued a placement that provided ‘real learning’ experiences and informed their needs and growth. Coaching and constructive feedback provided crucial markers and influenced students' learning performance. As their confidence increased, students became proactive in identifying complex caring activities to test and refine their knowledge and skills. Students visualized themselves working as a registered nurse within the critical care team. Conclusions: With appropriate support and supervision, a critical care placement for final-year nursing students is a stimulating and transformational experience. Relevance to Clinical Practice: This study highlights the importance of critical care placements for nursing students, aiding their transition to professional practice. Integrating well-supported placements into nursing curricula enhances decision-making abilities and readiness for future roles. Critical care nurse educators and managers should focus on developing effective support systems during these placements. By providing tailored support and preparing students for the demands of critical care, these experiences can improve job satisfaction and confidence, which are crucial for staff recruitment and retention in this challenging field. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aims to determine the levels of education quality (EQ), technology usage (TU), students' satisfaction (SS) and the impact of EQ on SS. Also, it seeks to find out how TU as a moderator affects EQ and SS in Pakistani private higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 440 postgraduate students at eleven private universities in Lahore, Punjab Province, Pakistan, participated in empirical research and data were obtained through the use of an online questionnaire. Simple random sampling was used to choose participants and partial least square structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. Findings: The findings revealed that Pakistani private HEIs have a medium level of EQ, TU and SS. Furthermore, the data reveal the existence of a significant positive relationship between EQ and SS, whereas TU as a moderator was found to negatively affect EQ and SS. Research limitations/implications: Postgraduate students of private HEIs in Pakistan were considered for this investigation and this study was limited to testing only in Punjab province. Another limitation of this study is that it was based on a research framework from previous research and literature. This study employed questionnaire surveys to conduct evaluations of teachers' teaching quality by university students. Furthermore, the questionnaire employed student self-evaluations to assess the quality of teaching. The research data would be more detailed if it were possible to include teachers' self-evaluations of their teaching quality. Practical implications: The current study provides key insights for policymakers, higher education commission and HEIs. The results suggest leveraging the identified medium levels of EQ, TU and student satisfaction in Pakistani private HEIs. In an effort to boost the medium levels, policymakers are encouraged to enhance the teaching and learning experience by robustly integrating Web 4.0 technologies. Institutions can intervene strategically by investing in infrastructure and innovative tools aligned with students' technological needs. Likewise, policymakers and institutions can optimize learning management systems (LMS) by developing and implementing policies that encourage their adoption and optimization across HEIs. This may contribute to the accomplishment of the United Nations' sustainable development goal of providing quality education. Moreover, with the help of this research HEIs can establish minimum quality standards regarding academic teaching and learning materials. Implementing the above-mentioned practical implications might boost student satisfaction in HEIs which would benefit not only students but also the institutions. Originality/value: The novelty of the article lies in the fact that it addresses the gap in the existing literature by exploring the levels of EQ, TU and student satisfaction in the context of private higher education in Pakistan. Furthermore, this study investigated whether TU served as a moderator in the relationship between student satisfaction and UNESCO-recommended EQ. This study elaborates on EQ indicators recommended by UNESCO in Pakistan’s private higher education sector. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Laryngeal Cancer (LC) constitutes approximately one third of head and neck cancers. Detecting early-stage lesions in this anatomical region is crucial for achieving a high survival rate. However, it poses significant diagnostic challenges owing to the varied appearance of lesions and the need for precise characterization for appropriate clinical management. Conventional diagnostic approaches rely heavily on endoscopic examination, which often requires expert interpretation and may be limited by subjective assessment. Deep learning (DL) approaches offer promising opportunities for automating lesion detection, but their efficacy in handling multi-modal imaging data and accurately localizing small lesions remains a subject of investigation. Furthermore, the clinical domain may largely benefit from the deployment of efficient DL methods that can ensure equitable access to advanced technologies, regardless of the availability of resources that can often be limited. In this study, a DL-based approach, named SRE-YOLO, was introduced to provide real-time assistance to less-experienced personnel during laryngeal assessment, by automatically detecting lesions at different scales from endoscopic White Light (WL) and Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) images. Methods: During the training, the SRE-YOLO integrates a YOLOv8 nano (YOLOv8n) baseline with a Super-Resolution (SR) branch to enhance lesion detection. This last component is decoupled during inference to preserve the low computational demand of the YOLOv8n baseline. The evaluation was conducted on a multi-center dataset, encompassing diverse laryngeal pathologies and acquisition modalities. Results: The SRE-YOLO method improved the Average Precision (AP @IoU=0.5) in lesion detection by 5% with respect to the YOLOv8n baseline, while maintaining the inference speed of 58.8 Frames Per Second (FPS). Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art DL methods highlighted the efficacy of the SRE-YOLO approach in balancing detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time applicability.

	abstract = {Diagnostic errors in health care pose significant risks to patient safety and are disturbingly common. In the emergency department (ED), the chaotic and high-pressure environment increases the likelihood of these errors, as emergency clinicians must make rapid decisions with limited information, often under cognitive overload. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to improve diagnostic errors in three key areas: information gathering, clinical decision support (CDS), and feedback through quality improvement. AI can streamline the information-gathering process by automating data retrieval, reducing cognitive load, and providing clinicians with essential patient details quickly. AI-driven CDS systems enhance diagnostic decision making by offering real-time insights, reducing cognitive biases, and prioritizing differential diagnoses. Furthermore, AI-powered feedback loops can facilitate continuous learning and refinement of diagnostic processes by providing targeted education and outcome feedback to clinicians. By integrating AI into these areas, the potential for reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient safety in the ED is substantial. However, successfully implementing AI in the ED is challenging and complex. Developing, validating, and implementing AI as a safe, human-centered ED tool requires thoughtful design and meticulous attention to ethical and practical considerations. Clinicians and patients must be integrated as key stakeholders across these processes. Ultimately, AI should be seen as a tool that assists clinicians by supporting better, faster decisions and thus enhances patient outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Most of the distributed photovoltaics (PV) are installed behind the meter (BTM), single-meter deployments permit distribution system operators to monitor only the net load and exclude the BTM PV generation, so the growing prevalence of BTM PV installations negatively affects distribution system planning and the local balance of supply and demand. However, existing methods for net load disaggregation mainly rely on the installation of expensive monitoring devices and high-resolution sensors, and face challenges such as privacy concerns, data diversity, and communication barriers. In this paper, an unsupervised method for aggregated net load disaggregation is proposed that achieves accurate separation of BTM PV outputs and actual loads using only net load data and exogenous variables. First, a data-driven method is developed to construct the actual load sample matrix of customers. Then, a virtual PV sample construction method based on the self-feedback decoupling algorithm (SFDA) is proposed to tackle the invisibility of BTM PV resources. The method performs self-feedback learning and constructs the virtual PV samples by minimizing the long-term decomposition residuals, and generates the virtual PV sample matrix. Finally, the model learning results are employed to achieve net load disaggregation through the contextually supervised source separation (CSSS) algorithm. The study utilized real open-source data whereby analyses reveal the method greatly enhances the decoupling accuracy of unsupervised algorithms. Furthermore, it eliminates a series of problems associated with traditional supervised algorithms and expands the scope of unsupervised decoupling methods. © 2024},

	abstract = {As climate change has become a global concern, the decarbonization of energy systems has become a prominent solution for CO2 emission reduction. The recent emergence of multi-energy hub systems (MEHs), characterized by interconnected energy hubs (EHs) and facilitated by energy sharing, presents a promising solution for seamlessly integrating a significant share of renewable energy sources (RESs) and flexibility among EHs. Faced with the intricate interplay and uncertainty of future energy markets, an extensive digital twin (EXDT) is proposed to perform predictive testing and evaluate the performance of MESs. This EXDT provides energy system operators with insights into the coordinated behavior of interconnected EHs under various future scenarios, thus contributing to smarter decision-making processes. Specifically, an array of scenarios including different decision-making strategies and P2P energy sharing strategies were considered. For each of these scenarios,"what-if" tests were conducted using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based method to model the stochastic decision-making process of EHs belonging to different stakeholders with access to local information. Uncertainties during operation can be mitigated using Markov Game (MG) by capturing knowledge from historical energy data. Subsequently, the economic and technical performance were evaluated using multidimensional evaluation indexes. The proposed MARL-based EXDT was applied to a representative 4-EH multi-energy system in China. Simulation results indicate that P2P energy sharing facilitates the local consumption of renewable energy, providing additional financial benefits and self-sufficiency to each EH and offering peak shaving to the upstream grid. Additionally, system performance under various decision-making and P2P sharing strategies was tested and evaluated to identify the impact of these strategies on system operation. © 2024},

This motivates the use of novel methodologies such as sustainable design, circular economy concepts, and causal machine learning algorithms. This study focuses on repair as one of the circular economy principles and investigates how tutorials promote the “Design for Repair” idea in three industry sectors: textiles, electronics, and vehicle accessories. To evaluate consumer engagement and sentiment, the paper has analysed user feedback from YouTube© repair instructions using sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and other data visualisation approaches. The findings are encouraging, demonstrating a generally positive response to repair-oriented programming, with high levels of trust and anticipation among viewers. Fluctuations in sentiment and engagement underscore the importance of constant content enhancement and smart dissemination via omnichannel touch points. A well-planned digital marketing strategy is critical for promoting circularity and fostering a culture of repair and sustainability, ensuring these principles reach and resonate with a broader audience. This study emphasises the importance of educational repair videos in promoting a culture of sustainability and repair.

	abstract = {Introduction Although curricula teaching skills related to resilience are widely adopted, little is known about needs and attitudes regarding resilience training of undergraduate-medical-trainees in Middle-East-and-North-Africa-region. The purpose of this study is to investigate the value of an innovative curriculum developed through design-based-research to build resilience-skills among undergraduate-medical-trainees in the United-Arab-Emirates. Methods Convergent-mixed-methods-study-design was utilized. Quantitative data collection was through controlled random group allocation conducted in one cohort of undergraduate medical students(n = 47). Students were randomly allocated into the respective resilience-skills-building-course(study-group) versus an unrelated curriculum(control-group). All students were tested at baseline(test-1), at end of 8-week course(test-2), and again 8 weeks after end of course(test-3). Then students crossed over to the opposite course and again tested at end of 8 weeks(test-4). Testing at four timepoints consisted of questionnaires related to burnout-Maslach-Burnout-Inventory; anxiety-General-Anxiety-Disorder-7; and resilience- Connor-Davidson-Resilience-Scale. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and inferentially. Qualitative data, constituting of students’ perception of their experience with the course, was captured using virtual-focus-group-sessions. Qualitative analysis was inductive. Generated primary inferences were merged using joint-display-analysis. Results Significant proportion of the students, at baseline, seemed to be at risk for burnout and anxiety, and would benefit from developing their resilience. There appeared to be no statistical differences in measures of burnout, anxiety, and resilience related to course delivery. Overall risk for anxiety among students increased following the COVID-19 lockdown. Qualitative analysis generated the ‘Resilience-Skills’-Building-around-Undergraduate-Medical-Education-Transitions’ conceptual model of five themes: Transitions, Adaptation, Added Value of course, Sustainability of effects of course, and Opportunities for improving course. Merging of findings led to a thorough understanding of how the resilience-skills’building-course affected students’ adaptability. Conclusion This study indicates that a resilience-skills’-building-course may not instantly affect medical trainees’ ratings of burnout, anxiety, and resilience. However, students likely engage with such an innovative course and its content to acquire and deploy skills to adapt to changes. © 2025 Otaki et al.

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of an interactive virtual reality (VR) training program aimed at enhancing Health and Safety (H&S) management practices in quarrying operations. The course was designed based on industry best practices, as well as both voluntary and mandatory standards relevant to marble mining activities. It combines experiential learning with a performance monitoring system that tracks completion rates, time taken, and scores based on user decisions. The primary objective was to assess the impact of VR training across different user groups, categorized by age, prior safety experience, familiarity with equipment and processes, and VR proficiency. This study involved 40 participants and analyzed 15 variables, including occupation, age, H&S skills, process knowledge, equipment familiarity, VR skills, physical impact of VR, number of attempts before completion, percentage and time of completion, achieved scores, retention of knowledge, and user feedback before and after training. Performance measurement was carried out using two methods: a Microsoft Forms questionnaire with 16 questions, completed by participants one week after training, and Simula Solution, which automatically tracked and recorded performance metrics (time, percentage, errors, and scores) during each session. The survey successfully identified which demographic groups were most affected by VR training. The findings of this study could have important implications for improving H&S practices in the mining sector by empowering workers to engage in training and interact with process resources. This allows them to experience virtual accidents in a controlled, risk-free environment. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accurate State of Health (SOH) estimation for lithium batteries (LIBs) is crucial for the safe operation of battery systems. However, the lack of physical properties and the varied operating conditions in real-world use further increase the difficulty of traditional SOH estimation, making it a significant challenge in current research. For this reason, this paper proposes a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) method for accurate SOH estimation of LIBs varied operating conditions. Considering the fully charged relaxation voltage data obtained easily in practical applications, firstly, this paper discussed the relaxation voltage data related to the battery's aging characteristics from the experimental tests. Secondly, the fractional-order equivalent circuit model (FOECM) is constructed and parameters characterizing battery degradation are identified for extracting the physical features. Ultimately, a novel PIML framework based FOECM of LIB is developed, then the datasets of three different battery types under different temperatures and discharge rates are used and validated for SOH estimation without considering any usage information. Experimental results show that the PIML method proposed in this paper can quickly achieve SOH estimation and keep the accuracy in 0.84 % for different types of batteries under varying experimental conditions. In addition, compared with other feature extraction methods, the PIML-based SOH estimation has obvious advantages with 16.2 %, which provides an important reference for the design and optimization of advanced battery management systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a growing global health concern with a high prevalence in the Asian and Western Pacific regions. Effective diabetes management mainly relies on self-care practices. However, glycemic control remains poor, especially in developing nations where healthcare access is limited. Low physician density and minimal healthcare funding exacerbate the challenges faced by people with diabetes in Asia. Digital health technologies offer promising solutions to bridge these gaps. These technologies enhance patient engagement, improve medication adherence, and promote healthier lifestyles. Mobile apps provide tools for self-management, such as monitoring physical activity and dietary intake, while telemedicine platforms and electronic medical records facilitate patient data management and remote consultations. Despite the advantages provided by digital health technologies in managing diabetes, barriers to their adoption include infrastructure limitations, regulatory challenges, and issues with data security. Some Asian countries have made major strides in the adoption of digital health tools with national strategies and regulatory bodies to manage digital health options; however, disparities in digital health readiness persist. Effective implementation of these technologies requires addressing these barriers, including enhancing infrastructure, improving app usability, and ensuring regulatory compliance. While digital health solutions present significant opportunities, their impact depends on overcoming current challenges and ensuring equitable access and effective use in managing diabetes. Future directions should focus on prioritizing app acceptance and efficacy, as well as integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence-powered digital solutions. © The Author(s) 2025.},

Consequently, this study introduces an innovative approach that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence to forecast the conceptual cost and duration of irrigation projects simultaneously. This study analyzed data from 1,277 historical cases using factor analysis and stepwise regression to distill 25 parameters down to five key drivers. It evaluates 12 machine learning models, including multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and decision tree-based ensemble methods. Bayesian optimization was employed to fine-tune the performance of each algorithm. The light gradient boosting machine is identified as the most effective algorithm for cost prediction, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.989 % and an Adjusted Determination Coefficient (R⁎2) of 0.931. For duration prediction, the extremely randomized tree model stands out, achieving a MAPE of 2.533 % and an R⁎2 of 0.961. The study further employs the Shapley additive explanation technique to improve the interpretability of the key drivers used for predicting both the budget and the timeline. © 2024},

	abstract = {This paper presents LAMB (Learning Assistant Manager and Builder), an innovative open-source software framework designed to create AI-powered Learning Assistants tailored for integration into learning management systems. LAMB addresses critical gaps in existing educational AI solutions by providing a framework specifically designed for the unique requirements of the education sector. It introduces novel features, including a modular architecture for seamless integration of AI assistants into existing LMS platforms and an intuitive interface for educators to create custom AI assistants without coding skills. Unlike existing AI tools in education, LAMB provides a comprehensive framework that addresses privacy concerns, ensures alignment with institutional policies, and promotes using authoritative sources. LAMB leverages the capabilities of large language models and associated generative artificial intelligence technologies to create generative intelligent learning assistants that enhance educational experiences by providing personalized learning support based on clear directions and authoritative fonts of information. Key features of LAMB include its modular architecture, which supports prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and the creation of extensive knowledge bases from diverse educational content, including video sources. The development and deployment of LAMB were iteratively refined using a minimum viable product approach, exemplified by the learning assistant: “Macroeconomics Study Coach,” which effectively integrated lecture transcriptions and other course materials to support student inquiries. Initial validations in various educational settings demonstrate the potential that learning assistants created with LAMB have to enhance teaching methodologies, increase student engagement, and provide personalized learning experiences. The system's usability, scalability, security, and interoperability with existing LMS platforms make it a robust solution for integrating artificial intelligence into educational environments. LAMB's open-source nature encourages collaboration and innovation among educators, researchers, and developers, fostering a community dedicated to advancing the role of artificial intelligence in education. This paper outlines the system architecture, implementation details, use cases, and the significant benefits and challenges encountered, offering valuable insights for future developments in artificial intelligence assistants for any sector. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Rangeland management necessitates addressing complex and dynamic social-ecological challenges and opportunities at scales appropriate to target landscapes. We combine geospatial and climate data in an agent-based system dynamics model to simulate temporally and spatially scalable rangeland human-environment-animal-forage relationships. Modeling highly variable grazing system elements requires both adaptability and mathematical realism. Agent-based modeling makes it possible to test alternative approaches to real-world scenarios without taking risks associated with actual experimentation on working operations. Our agent-based model, Ecological Comanagement of Rangelands, or ECo-Range, allows managers to simulate cattle grazing scenarios by setting environmental conditions and management decisions that affect simulation outcomes. In this sense, ECo-Range is not just a product of scientific inquiry, but a tool to be used for collaborative discovery, as it illuminates relationships among environmental conditions, management decisions, and ecological and livestock outcomes for modeled landscapes. ECo-Range explores the complexities of grazing management, embracing rather than excluding variability and heterogeneity inherent in rangeland social-ecological systems. We first present ECo-Range, explaining the model's relevance to the fields of simulation modeling and rangeland management. We then present a case study on the Colorado Front Range as proof of concept to test the utility, validity, and applicability of ECo-Range as a learning tool to explore scenarios related to government-owned landscapes that necessitate comanagement approaches to cattle grazing. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: Hospitals can improve how they learn from patient safety incidents. The Green Cross method, a proactive reporting and learning method, is one strategy to meet this challenge. In it, nurses play a key role. However, describing its impact on learning from the users' perspective is important. Aim: This study aimed to describe nurses' experiences of learning from patient safety incidents before and 3 months after implementing the Green Cross method in a postanaesthesia care unit. Study Design: A qualitative study with an inductive descriptive design with focus group interviews was conducted before and 3 months after implementing the Green Cross method to assess its impact. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The study was conducted in a postanaesthesia care unit in a Norwegian hospital trust. Results: Before implementing the Green Cross method, participants indicated limited openness and learning, including the subcategories ‘Lack of openness hampers learning’, ‘Adverse events were taken seriously’ and ‘Insufficient visible improvements’. After implementing the Green Cross method, participants indicated the emergence of a learning environment, including the subcategories ‘Transparency increases learning’, ‘Increased patient safety awareness’ and ‘Committed to quality improvements’. Conclusions: Implementing the Green Cross method in a postanaesthesia care unit positively impacted openness and nurses' patient safety awareness, which is crucial for learning and improving quality. Relevance to Clinical Practice: The Green Cross method could be useful for organizational learning and facilitating learning from patient safety incidents through transparency, discussion and involvement of nursing staff. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on service coexistence within the 5G network. Specifically, we aim to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) for Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) within 5G networks. We propose a smart scheduler by integrating machine learning models. Real-time channel reports are used to make data-driven decisions based on current network conditions, thereby centralizing scheduling tasks to streamline operations and enhance adaptability. The key contributions include the development of an adaptive scheduling strategy that dynamically switches between reactive and proactive approaches, ensuring optimal balance between low latency and ultra-reliability for URLLC services. Additionally, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is applied to accurately predict URLLC traffic delays, assuring effective prioritization and timely delivery of time-sensitive services. Furthermore, the proposed solution combines network virtualization and machine learning techniques to address security risks and potential service interruptions linked to reactive scheduling policies. The proposed approach enhances existing methods by improving network virtualization features, which are integrated with machine learning models, specifically XGBoost to optimize the scheduling of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Unlike previous work, our proposal uses network virtualization to enable a dynamic combination of proactive and reactive scheduling strategies that can be adapted in real-time. Network virtualization features provide centralized control and resource management, resulting in reduced complexity and more efficient resource allocation. This helps the scheduler react quickly to changing network conditions, ensuring low latency and high reliability of URLLC services. In addition, network virtualization enhances the security level by isolating different types of traffic and mitigating risks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and impersonation attacks. Subsequently, the integration of advanced network virtualization functions with machine-learning predictions not only optimizes planning but also enhances security and resource management. The proposed system is evaluated through simulations, demonstrating robust performance with low latency and high reliability for URLLC services. The XGBoost model achieves impressive results with low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on both validation and holdout datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Research shows that how formative assessments are operationalized plays a crucial role in shaping their engagement with formative assessments, thereby impacting their effectiveness in predicting academic achievement. Mandatory assessments can ensure consistent student participation, leading to better tracking of learning progress. Optional assessments may encourage voluntary engagement, potentially leading to a more genuine reflection of student understanding. Also, frequent assessments provide continuous opportunities for feedback and adjustment, which can keep students actively engaged in the learning process. Objectives: This study aims to investigate two crucial facets of formative assessments: frequency and the level of stakes involved (mandatory vs. optional). We examine how modifying the frequency of formative assessments affects students' course performance. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of mandatory versus optional formative assessments on students' course performance in higher education. Methods: The sample of this study consisted of undergraduate students (n = 336) enrolled in three sections of a large asynchronous course at a Canadian university. We extracted features associated with online formative assessments (e.g., the number of attempts and average scores) from the learning management system. Next, we used these features to predict students' performance in summative assessments (two midterms and a final exam). Results and Conclusions: Our findings indicated that increasing the frequency of online formative assessments did not consistently improve student performance. Also, participation frequency in online formative assessments seemed to vary depending on assessment stakes (i.e., optional vs. mandatory). We recommend that instructors examine what conditions can maximize the contribution of formative assessments to students' academic achievement before building predictive models. © 2024 The Author(s).

The review underscores the critical role of structural properties, including stiffness, strength, and ductility, in designing earthquake-resistant structures. By exploring a range of seismic analysis methods, such as force-based, displacement-based, and numerical approaches, the review highlights the significance of a holistic approach in assessing structural response to seismic events. Moreover, the review delves into innovative methods like subspace system identification for damage detection and statistical analysis of seismic sequences, offering promising avenues for future research. The adoption of passive energy dissipation systems and base isolation techniques emerges as key strategies in reducing seismic damage and enhancing structural resilience. Additionally, the review discusses the potential of machine learning techniques in predicting seismicity rates and improving risk management in seismic-prone areas. By combining traditional and advanced methods, this review sets the stage for further developments in seismic damage mitigation strategies. The integration of technological expertise, scientific aptitude, and interdisciplinary approaches is highlighted as essential in ensuring the built environment adapts to unforeseeable natural forces. Ultimately, this review provides a foundational resource for academics, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of earthquake mitigation and structural safety. © 2025, University of Kufa.

	abstract = {Objective: Assessment of the value of review of home videos by a pediatric multidisciplinary team (MDT) in a pediatric neurophysiology department. Methods: We describe and evaluate the review of home videos alongside clinical history and previous investigations from patients referred to the Evelina pediatric EEG department at a twice-monthly MDT meeting between 01/2021 and 09/2022. We retrospectively analyzed measures of video quality, quantity and duration, time taken from referral to MDT meeting, pre-MDT and post-MDT meeting proposed diagnosis and clinical outcomes. Feedback from referring doctors was obtained by a survey. Results: There were 36 referrals for 34 patients totalling 123 videos. There was a median delay of 10 days between video upload and final report. After the MDT meeting the number of referrals classified as uncertain fell from 15 to 2. The number of referrals classified as non-epileptic events increased from seven to 18. The number classified as infantile spasms fell from six to two. Overall, 26 of 36 referrals had a change in diagnosis and 26 of 36 referrals were triaged away from the video-EEG telemetry (VT) waiting list. Nine out of ten referring doctors reported that MDT discussion improved their understanding of the events. Significance: HVR is a useful tool that has been successfully incorporated into our neurophysiology department's workflow. These early results suggest benefits from adopting an MDT meeting may include an early diagnosis and management approach based upon consensus. Using HVR in a pediatric population may help triage urgent cases, conserve specialized neurophysiological investigations and streamline workflows to improve the efficiency of pediatric referrals. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose Virtual patients (VPs) are increasingly used in health care professions education to support clinical reasoning (CR) development. However, the extent to which feedback is given across CR components is unknown, and guidance is lacking on how VPs can optimize CR development. This systematic review sought to identify how VPs provide feedback on CR. Method Seven databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations) were searched in March 2023 using terms (e.g., medical education, virtual patient, case-based learning, computer simulation) adapted from a previous systematic review. All studies describing VP use for developing CR in medical professionals and provided feedback on at least 1 CR component were retrieved. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed. Narrative synthesis was performed to describe the approaches used to measure and provide feedback on CR. Results A total of 6,526 results were identified from searches, of which 72 met the criteria, but only 35 full-text articles were analyzed because the reporting of interventions in abstracts (n = 37) was insufficient. The most common CR components developed by VPs were leading diagnosis (23 [65.7%]), management or treatment plan (23 [65.7%]), and information gathering (21 [60%]). The CR components were explored by various approaches, from predefined questions to free text and concept maps. Conclusions Studies describing VP use for giving CR feedback have mainly focused on easy-to-assess CR components, whereas few studies have described VPs designed for assessing CR components, such as problem representation, hypothesis generation, and diagnostic justification. Despite feedback being essential for learning, few VPs provided information on the learner's use of self-regulated learning processes. Educators designing or selecting VPs for CR use must consider the needs of learner groups and how different CR components can be explored and should make the instructional design of VPs explicit in published work.

	abstract = {Introduction: It is estimated that one in 30 patients experiences at least one preventable medication-related harm while receiving care. Cyclical medicine improvement interventions, where health systems continuously collect data, implement prescribing/dispensing interventions, review outcomes, and revise the intervention, have demonstrated health outcome improvements in a range of health care settings. This systematic review aimed to synthesize information on the characteristics and outcomes of cyclical medication management interventions. Methods: Five databases were systematically searched for cyclical medication management interventions from 2000 to 2023. Studies were screened in a two-step process: title/abstract and full-text screening. All intervention, population, and outcome data were extracted. Intervention data were thematically categorized, and outcome data were categorized using Proctor's framework. The quality of data was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Results: Forty-five cyclical interventions from 46 publications were included. Most interventions studied cyclical medication management interventions in hospital settings (80%, n = 37) and utilized the plan-do-study-act framework to guide intervention design (64%, n = 29). Cyclical medication management interventions comprised multiple components (mean 2.4 components), with common components including practice standardization (n = 23), clinician feedback (n = 20), and clinician education (n = 18). One hundred and twenty-two outcome measures were extracted and categorized as implementation (n = 77), service (n = 41), and patient outcomes (n = 4). The quality of many publications was poor; 8 publications could not be scored or scored 0 on the MMAT, and the remaining publications scored on average (mean) 60% on the MMAT. Conclusion: Cyclical medication management interventions show weak evidence that they can be implemented successfully and improve health system and service outcomes. Significant further research and health system structuring are required to address the quality issues surrounding cyclical medication management implementation and reporting. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to predict students' final achievement based on their ongoing engagement and formative assessment results within learning management systems (LMSs). This study incorporates ongoing assessment performance as a key factor in measuring student engagement and predicting final exam performance. The results indicate that in the blended teaching process, firstly, including ongoing engagement activities in the final assessment has a positive effect on final exam scores. Secondly, the predictive effect of multiple continuous tasks is superior to that of a single continuous task, and ongoing engagement activities are better predictors of final exam scores than formative assessments. Thirdly, using a standard level as a reference for prediction yields relatively high accuracy, while using an average level as a reference can better identify at-risk students. Therefore, it is recommended that instructors comprehensively incorporate continuous tasks that can reflect students' engagement into the final assessment in blended courses.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},
