Enterprise governance is a subset of IT governance that aids in the management of information technology resources. COBIT is a widely used methodology for developing effective enterprise IT governance. ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) stated implementation solution currently uses a sequentially ordered approach, which has raised issues. Several challenges have arisen as a result of top management's lack of commitment and misplaced solutions. Limitation on this investigation is the customized and confidential governance pattern used across various organization, hence there are very limited real time data for end-to-end analysis. Nonetheless, in combination with the agile project management paradigm, new project life-cycle solutions have evolved. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an important element to address the increasing demand for machine learning systems. Artificial neural network (ANN) method is highly useful to arrive at best possible solution to improve the project success.

However, the difficulty of AI algorithm research and development, the lack of unified management of data and models, and other issues restrict the wide application of AI technology in power systems. Establishing a unified AI platform for the power system and providing a unified AI model operation service support has become the key to power system AI technology progress. In this work, we propose a power system AI platform design and implementation plan, which provides the full-chain functions from model production to service formation, including sample processing, model training, and shared release. Specifically, the platform includes three modules—data set, model set, and learning environment—which have functions such as model deployment, data management, service release, and service management, etc. The data set includes functions such as data preprocessing, tag management, and metadata management, and has multi-person collaborative service interfaces. The model set includes model evaluation, model compression, model resources and catalog service interfaces. The learning environment includes functions such as custom algorithm management, automated model training, resource scheduling, etc. The results of applying AI technology in typical business scenarios such as power transmission, power transformation, and safety supervision verify the platform's full-chain support capability in the model formation process.","","978-1-6654-2624-4","10.1109/ICSAI53574.2021.9664153","State Grid Technical Project(grant numbers:5442AI210006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664153","","Training;Power transmission;Production;Data models;Power industry;Power systems;Safety","","","","15","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the current situational systems can only provide evaluation and feedback on text or language, and cannot provide feedback on body movements and emotional expressions. To address these issues, this study establishes a situational learning system that enables students to enter the learning situation with their whole body and in small groups. Furthermore, the cognitive services of artificial intelligence are also adopted to conduct immediate evaluation and feedback on students’ learning performance, such as language, body movement, and emotional display, and students’ learning outcomes can be displayed in front of their peers.

These waste management companies have a very high energy consumption processes involved in their operations. But most of these companies also rely on local power generation and hence making it a beneficial field to study micro grids. Our main aim through this research is to make sure that these waste management companies work with their best efficiency by processing the waste and to enable it dominance on micro grids without elimination user interference. This is done through a very unique machine learning approach. In this approach we first predict the amount of waste that can be brought to these companies with the help of ANN (artificial neural network). Then this waste is processed and optimized through Lagrangian Algorithm on the energy requirements that are dependent upon renewable energy. Also, this approach caters to user interference and preferences. This user preference is fed to the model with the help of user feedbacks and then processed through support vector machine. In order to include user feedback, we have used an active learning paradigm. This method is tested on a waste management company of district Warendorf. The results hence prove that the energy requirements can be managed and controlled in a micro grid with giving importance to user feedback.","","978-1-6654-2867-5","10.1109/ICESC51422.2021.9532680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9532680","Micro Grids;Renewable Energy;Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Support Vector Machine;Waste Management","Waste management;Support vector machines;Rails;Renewable energy sources;Visualization;Companies;Machine learning","","1","","11","IEEE","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a branch of artificial intelligence in which devices are built or programmed in order to function mostly on its own. In order to be able to predict or make decisions, mathematical models are built by the algorithms. Since machine learning is close to computational statistics, it is useful in developing computers to access data and derive the required outputs. Business Intelligence (BI) consists of the technologies and applications that are used to collect, integrate, analyze raw data and present information of a particular business. These systems help in making strategies and decisions in order to get better results for the future by comparing the past and present performances. It also helps organizations identify the market trends and business problems that have to be looked upon. Along with many advantages like boosting productivity and accountability, it also has a few drawbacks such as it being costly, complex and takes a long time to be implemented. In this paper, we have discussed how combining machine learning with business intelligence would be a true game-changer for companies who can afford it. It can not only help improve operational processes and provide better customer services, but also analyze large amounts of data and achieve real-time data analysis, as well as prevent the number of cybercrimes as these systems can learn to differentiate between what is the threat and what is not. Paper also represents the algorithms that are being used by the company in the process, and if it has been beneficial to them or not. One of the algorithms of machine learning that is used is linear regression. It is easy to implement and is used for purposes such as predicting real estate prices, financial performances and traffic. Cluster analysis is also used for the purpose of understanding the relationship between consumers and the products they mostly search for. In this paper a case study has been presented to demonstrate the business operations that take place in a major airport retailer in the region, and how they take the advantage of Business Intelligence to get better outcomes.","","978-1-6654-1450-0","10.1109/ICIEM51511.2021.9445344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445344","Machine Learning;Deep Learning;Business Intelligence;Automation;BI tools","Productivity;Computers;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Companies;Tools;Prediction algorithms","","16","","27","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main goal of a chatbot is to create a human-like conversation between a human and a machine, to reduce the work stress. The chatbot can be implemented in any industry easily, unlike any other product where the products need to be developed and tested before switching platforms. In colleges, especially during the time of admission, reception gets crowded and people have to wait to get their queries solved. If any person wants to know about the college, then he/she has to travel to college. Although every college has its website, not everybody can find the answer to their query. Colleges are not working on weekends, so if someone wants to visit or call reception to get their query answered they will have to wait until any working weekday. To solve these problems, we will create an AI chatbot. This chatbot will be embedded on the college website and will be able to answer any college-related query easily. Chabot will be able to answer multiple persons at the same time, people don't have to visit the college to get their query solved and it will be available 24/7.","","978-1-7281-4635-5","10.1109/ICCDW45521.2020.9318648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318648","RASA;machine learning;LSTM;RNN","Chatbot;Databases;Artificial intelligence;Machine learning;Knowledge based systems;Information technology;Open source software","","8","","10","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This need is more pressing as unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) are applied in new areas and innovations such as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) swarms are developed. Millimeter-wave helps to meet the throughput demand as it provides the higher bandwidth that is needed for 5G wireless communication and beyond. But these higher frequencies also come with their own challenges, such as low signal penetration depth. The main challenge in modern wireless networks is to be able to accurately predict the dynamically changing radio environment. With the introduction of narrow beams in the mm-wave frequency, tracking of the beams is a great challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) could be employed to resolve this problem of beam tracking. In this talk, the challenges in mm-wave wireless networks for vehicle-to-vehicle communication will be highlighted and the ideas involving recent developments in phased-array antenna, beam-steering, beam-alignment, and tracking will be discussed. We shall then critically evaluate the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum computing (QC) within the network architecture to provide the required capability for tasks such as beam-control, data-feed processing, resource, and interference management. The next-generation wireless networks need to be self-predictive and proactive to handle futuristic applications like holographic communication, haptic feedback, or any latency-dependent application. Especially in the context of rapidly changing environment where the UAVs are moving fast, AI and/or QC would play a crucial role to achieve a dynamically adaptive network. Next-generation wireless networks offer more capacity for the conveyance of relevant information from onboard instruments such as cameras or thermal sensors. Thus, there shall be a need for the efficient processing of potentially copious amounts of raw data for relevant information. For example, to deploy a drone swarm in a search and rescue operation, the use of QC or AI could improve the processing of received visual information with respect to processing speed. The application of AI and QC for mm Wave-UAV communications is a promising research direction to break through the traditional communication paradigm and integrate communication, computing, and storage resources.","","978-1-6654-0537-9","10.1109/MetroCon54219.2021.9666048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666048","Millimeter wave;unmanned aerial vehicles;beam steering antenna;drone to drone communication;5G","Computers;Quantum computing;Array signal processing;Wireless networks;Millimeter wave technology;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Throughput","","4","","82","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reason behind the growth is the demand for online studies created due to the corona pandemic. The ODL system involves study that is not limited by geographical boundaries and extends to many knowledge areas electronically. In practice the study tends to extend to knowledge areas beyond those offered by the standard contact or traditional universities. At the University of South Africa (UNISA), the adoption of the ODL framework to theoretical subjects has been successful by making use of the Sakai virtual learning environment (VLE). The practical subjects or practical knowledge areas on the other hand have previously been taught face-to-face. Therefore, the practical modules have not been effectively taught online particularly in the electrical engineering curriculum. This issue can contribute to graduates who are unskilled in the practical component of a knowledge area, which can lead to unemployment. Virtual learning environments (VLE's) play a vital role when it comes to teaching and learning online. In this paper, the impact of VLE’s on the practical skills of students and practical knowledge is investigated. This is done by analyzing the change in pass rates of students in a practical subject such as Electrical Engineering when taught face-to-face as compared to when taught through a VLE such as Sakai online. Two groups termed as emerging centered learner (ECL) and a developed centered learner (DCL) are investigated. The method evaluates students who study electrical engineering practical module part-time. In this paper the Sakai platform was used as a VLE to teach and then evaluate students in the electrical engineering practical module. The practical guide with the full set of experiments was uploaded on Sakai under additional resources. The students were given the necessary guidelines and tasks via Sakai online, examined and then the pass rates achieved were analyzed at the end of the program and compared to the pass rates achieved using previous face-to-face teaching method used for the same practical’s. It was determined that a VLE can be used to improve the pass rates of a practical module such as electrical engineering taught online in ODL.","","978-1-6654-8422-0","10.1109/icABCD54961.2022.9856040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856040","Electrical Engineering;Open Distance Learning (ODL);Practical’s;Pass rates;Sakai;Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)","Electrical engineering;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Pandemics;Education;Data communication;Unemployment","","1","","20","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a word-based partially observable Markov decision processes' dialog management that integrates natural language understanding, state tracker, and action selector into an end-to-end architecture. Our proposed dialog management takes the words from user utterances as inputs and then produces optimal action as well as slot values of natural language understanding which are necessary for response generation. To this end, we propose a hybrid learning method, which integrates reinforcement learning and supervised learning, to optimize the action selector and slot filler jointly. In addition, we develop a high-return prioritized experience replay to speed up the convergence of the training process. The experimental results show that the proposed dialog management outperforms four strong baselines in a series of different dialog tasks. A human user's evaluation also shows the same results.

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.","","978-1-6654-7477-1","10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185519","smart home;vulnerable group support;homeless support;chronic disease management;senior care;independent living;smart energy management;smart infrastructure support;smart response system for urgent situations;smart mobility;smart humanity;information flow;material cycle;smart lifestyle management;smart community user acceptance;Universal Village;smart monitoring;smart activity understanding;human-computer interaction;computer vision;machine learning;safety and security;adversarial attach;reinforcement learning;adaptive control;system theory;dynamic relationship;coordination & automation;closed feedback loop;robustness & resilience;sustainability","Home appliances;Smart cities;Decision making;Smart homes;Medical services;Safety;Older adults","","1","","471","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To satisfy stringent requirements of diversified services, network slicing is developed, which enables service-oriented resource allocation by tailoring the infrastructure network into multiple logical networks. However, there are still some challenges in cross-domain multi-dimensional resource management for end-to-end (E2E) slices under the dynamic and uncertain environment. Trading off the revenue and cost of resource allocation while guaranteeing service quality is significant to tenants. Therefore, this article introduces a hierarchical resource management framework, utilizing deep reinforcement learning in admission control of resource requests from different tenants and resource adjustment within admitted slices for each tenant. In particular, we first discuss the challenges in customized resource management of 6G. Second, the motivation and background are presented to explain why artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in resource customization of multi-tenant slicing. Third, E2E resource management is decomposed into two problems, multi-dimensional resource allocation decision based on slice-level feedback, and real-time slice adaption aimed at avoiding service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-based customized slicing. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed in practical implementation are investigated.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000644","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1803304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822104,61771044,B170003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:FRF-TP-19-002C1,FRF-TP-19-0S1A1,RC1631); University of Science and Technology Beijing; Communication University of China(grant numbers:SKLMCC2020KF010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382026","","Resource management;6G mobile communication;Network slicing;Dynamic scheduling;Decision making;Real-time systems","","63","","15","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, in reality, most machine learning models, despite achieving good technical solutions to predictive problems wind up not being deployed. The reasons for this are many and have their origin in data scientists and machine learning practitioners not paying enough attention to issues of deployment in production. The issues range all the way from establishing trust by business stakeholders and users, to failure to explain why models work and when they do not, to failing to appreciate the importance of establishing a robust quality data pipeline, to ignoring many constraints that apply to deployed models, and finally to a lack of understanding the true cost of production deployment and the associated ROI.

In this context, descriptive and predictive analytics has gained a significant research attention; however, prescriptive analytics has just started to emerge as the next step towards increasing data analytics maturity and leading to optimized decision making ahead of time. Although machine learning for decision making has been identified as one of the most important applications of AI, up to now, prescriptive analytics is mainly addressed with domain-specific optimization models. On the other hand, existing literature lacks generalized prescriptive analytics models capable of being dynamically adapted according to the human preferences. Reinforcement Learning, as the third machine learning paradigm alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning, has the potential to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and time-variant environments, the huge states space of sequential decision making processes, as well as the incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we propose a human-augmented prescriptive analytics approach using Interactive Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (IMORL) in order to cope with the complexity of real-life environments and the need for optimized human-machine collaboration. The decision making process is modelled in a generalized way in order to assure scalability and applicability in a wide range of problems and applications.

Recent methods typically build their predictive models by full connection layers, but the shortage of utilizing action and observation information in complex multi-agent environment limits the performance of those methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel predictive model based on self-attention mechanism which can effectively use information in the environment. Specifically, we use the MADDPG algorithm to make a dataset where the input is the observations and actions and the output is the predicted observations and rewards. We also introduce the multi-head attention mechanism into the predictive model so that the predictive model can better combine different information for prediction. We perform extensive experiments to assess the proposed method and compare it with the representative baseline approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitors with higher accuracy in different tasks.

Centralized orchestration, although optimal, comes at the cost of high signaling overhead. Alternatively, decentralized RL-based approaches such as Q-Learning (QL) are envisaged to be more suitable for the strict latency and overhead requirements of B5G/6G use cases, while also minimizing the number of resource allocation conflicts encountered in a distributed setting. Before QL agents can take optimal auto-scaling decisions, they need to explore or evaluate their actions based on the feedback they receive from the environment. The faster they learn, the sooner they could begin to exploit their knowledge. However, it is not clear when these agents have explored long enough to start taking management actions. This paper focuses on understanding when the exploration should end such that agents may start exploiting built knowledge. In our approach, we posit that the knowledge accrued by the agents in their Q-tables should indicate whether to explore or exploit. Hence, we conceive Knowledge Indicators (KIs) derived from their Q-tables. These KIs enable agents to learn autonomously, thereby enabling adjustment of the exploration parameter epsilon in the epsilon-greedy approach. Convergence results and corresponding impact on the system performance validate the proposed approach. This work has the potential to speed up the convergence of QL agents, thereby providing critical hints to operators targeting live deployments of B5G/6G decentralized network management.","","978-1-6654-2390-8","10.1109/GCWkshps52748.2021.9682129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682129","B5G network management;vertical auto-scaling;decentralized RL;Q-table;exploration;exploitation","Q-learning;Costs;System performance;Conferences;Memory management;Resource management;Convergence","","7","","15","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider a ML framework that may accelerate model learning and improve its interpretability by incorporating human experts into the model learning loop. We propose a novel human-in-the-loop ML framework aimed at dealing with learning problems that the cost of data annotation is high and the lack of appropriate data to model the association between the target tasks and the input features. With an application to precision dosing, our experimental results show that the approach can learn interpretable rules from data and may potentially lower experts' workload by replacing data annotation with rule representation editing.

We aimed to create a rule-based set of guidelines for the desired hierarchy, timing, content, and modality of feedback such a system should provide to users, such that they receive the necessary feedback, at the relevant time, in a way that enhances their performance, and does not encumber it. We conducted four focus groups with 20 stroke clinicians. The clinicians described the guiding principles they use when giving feedback to patients, and noted different output should be provided to the patient versus the clinician by the rehabilitation system. They delineated a hierarchy for providing feedback during the exercise set: success on the task is the primary goal, and feedback should be given on this aspect first. Once success is achieved, feedback should be given on the quality of the movement. Only when the task is successfully completed, with no compensatory movements (i.e., high quality), feedback should be given on movement speed. Using a follow-up survey and the member-checking approach, it was revealed that this hierarchical structure applies to early stages in the rehabilitation process, and that quality of movement becomes paramount as the rehabilitation process progresses. The clinicians expressed their desire to receive a full report on the patient's performance in each exercise session, which is more comprehensive than the feedback provided to the patient in real time.

However, the multi-channel service has an extra overhead coordinating channel selection to identify which channel is available to send messages to customers because of the disparate nature of the integrated channels. Machine learning can be used to determine channels for communication in a customer alert system used by financial services institutions (FSIs). This work offers a machine-learning-enabled channel selection and management method based on Tug Of War (TOW) algorithm. The framework proposed will be based on the TOW dynamics algorithm. TOW uses a modified learning technique based on addition and subtraction's reward/loss principle. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy by prototyping the proposed framework in a customer alert system termed the ML-Enabled MCM system. Messaging channels such as SMS, Email, Twitter Direct Messages, Instagram Direct Messages, Telegram, and Facebook Direct Messages were integrated with an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) responsible for channel management. The new design reveals that the machine learning-enabled MCM system can learn and adapt quickly in response to channel feedback and make quick decisions about which channels a customer can receive messages on while maintaining balance within the system. The proposed framework will be relevant to the event and message processing products offered by FSIs.","","978-1-6654-8422-0","10.1109/icABCD54961.2022.9856210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856210","Channel Assignment;Messaging;Banking;Event Driven Systems;Service Oriented Architecture;TOW;Machine Learning;Decision Based Systems","Machine learning algorithms;Social networking (online);Heuristic algorithms;Multimedia Web sites;Machine learning;Channel allocation;Service-oriented architecture","","","","30","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, the SFCL allocation is converted into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem in this paper. A designer to find the optimal SFCL allocation is viewed as an agent, and the power system is regarded as the environment. The agent adjusts the location and size of SFCLs to respond to the feedback from the environment optimally. The Q-learning algorithm is applied to solve the RL problem.

However, an integrative method may be of high complexity in model training due to the expanded prediction rule, and a sequential method is of inconvenience in deployment because more than one parametric models have to be maintained. In this paper, we convert the HOCCF problem to an adaptive transfer learning task, where we first model browses via a factorization model from a perspective of the role of browser, and then adaptively refine the learned model parameters via purchases from a perspective of the dependent role of purchaser. Based on this conversion, we design a novel solution called role-based adaptive factorization (ROAF), and then derive two specific variants with pairwise preference learning and pointwise preference learning. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical studies on two large datasets, and find that our ROAF is a very promising solution in terms of recommendation accuracy, besides its convenience of one single parametric model in deployment.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207219","Transfer Learning;Heterogeneous One-Class Collaborative Filtering;Adaptive Factorization","Browsers;Adaptation models;Parametric statistics;Training;Bayes methods;Task analysis","","","","23","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pushing for better systems is a challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a model consists of direct and emulated recursive forecasting strategies. The model inputs are a decomposed sub time series of the original data. To improve the forecast accuracy, proper modeling of features, capturing the dependencies in the direct forecast. Decomposing the time-series dataset into feature-based sub-series, allow the model to benefit from higher predictability characteristics, in addition to utilizing the power of direct forecast strategy. Next, feeding back predictions of sub-series in a cyclic manner produces n-step predictions in a row, which achieves the target of the multi-step forecast while avoiding accumulated feedback error in a multi-step recursive strategy.

Real-world environments (e.g. industrial robots or power grids) are generally designed with safety constraints in mind implemented in the shape of valid actions masks or contingency controllers. For example, the range of motion and the angles of the motors of a robot can be limited to physical boundaries. Violating constraints thus results in rejected actions or entering in a safe mode driven by an external controller, making RL agents incapable of learning from their mistakes. In this paper, we propose a simple modification of a state-of-the-art deep RL algorithm (DQN), enabling learning from forbidden actions. To do so, the standard Q-learning update is enhanced with an extra safety loss inspired by structured classification.

This makes it hard for operators to adopt the given solutions. The proposed Cluster Characterized Autoencoder (CCA) architecture improves model interpretability by designing an end-to-end data driven AI-based framework. Candidate anomalies identified using the feature optimised Autoencoder and entropy based feature ranking are clustered in reconstruction error space using subspace clustering. This clustering is seen to separate true positives and false positives and how well this is done is evaluated using entropy and information gain. A two dimensional t-SNE representation of anomaly clusters is used as a graphical interface to the analysis and explanation of individual anomalies using SHAP values. The solution provided by this unsupervised approach helps the analyst in the categorisation, identification and feature explanation of anomalies providing faster root cause analysis.

Especially, clogs and jams are easily triggered in width-changing areas. In this article, we consider pedestrian movement in heterogeneous corridors and design an optimal feedback control to regulate pedestrian flow. Flow characteristics are first studied based on microscopic social-force simulations. A Gaussian process describes the relationship between flow variables with the observation data. The macroscopic model for flow in heterogeneous corridors is developed. To avoid jams, discharges among these corridors are balanced with the narrowest corridor as the primary concern. At the equilibrium, a continuous-time nonlinear control system is formulated, and the adaptive dynamic programming learns the optimal feedback controller. Policy iteration (PI) and neural networks are combined together, and the convergence of neural-network-based PI is demonstrated by analyzing its equivalence to the Gauss–Newton method. Batch normalization is introduced to stabilize the learning process. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the control design can effectively regulate pedestrian flow for both macroscopic and microscopic models. Note to Practitioners—The development of video-processing techniques provides a powerful tool to detect human behavior in real time. In crowd events, the pedestrian movement must be regulated; otherwise, it is easy to fall into the faster-is-slower effect. It is especially important for evacuation routes with different widths. In this article, the optimal feedback control is studied to regulate pedestrian flow in heterogeneous corridors. It takes flow densities as state and produces commands that are composed of entrance influx and free-flow velocities. These commands can be executed with the support of speakers, displays, or the recently developed interactive robots. To avoid congestion, discharges of different corridors are balanced, and the system is optimally stabilized at equilibrium. Based on our work, engineers are able to design pedestrian flow control and achieve optimal evacuation in arbitrary heterogeneous corridors.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.2996018","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101005,2018AAA0102404); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI 1526835); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9108557","Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP);heterogeneous corridors;macroscopic pedestrian dynamics;optimal feedback control;pedestrian flow","Feedback control;Mathematical models;Dynamic programming","","9","","40","IEEE","4 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adoption of e-learning is gaining traction as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world in 2019 and become a necessity for all educational institutions. Although today the institutions have opted for e-learning as an alternative way to carry out the learning process, many are still not ready and facing difficulties in implementing, managing, and using it. This research aimed to investigate the issues and challenges of e-learning implementation during the Covid-19 pandemic at Universitas Esa Unggul. This research was conducted using exploratory research method by conducting literature study, observation, interview, and survey to examine the lecturer's and student's experiences and perspectives of the e-learning system. The questionnaire was adapted from an Information Technology Service Management perspective to gain data of e-learning satisfaction, availability of e-learning facilities, e-learning ease of use, availability of guidelines, availability of system supports, and to get feedbacks from the student and the lecturer.

Demand response schemes seek to incentivise consumers to use green energy and reduce their electricity usage during peak periods which helps support grid balancing of supply-demand and generate revenue by selling surplus of energy back to the grid. This paper proposes an effective energy management system for residential demand response using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fuzzy Reasoning (FR). RL is considered as a model-free control strategy which learns from the interaction with its environment by performing actions and evaluating the results. The proposed algorithm considers human preference by directly integrating user feedback into its control logic using fuzzy reasoning as reward functions. Q-learning, a RL strategy based on a reward mechanism, is used to make optimal decisions to schedule the operation of smart home appliances by shifting controllable appliances from peak periods, when electricity prices are high, to off-peak hours, when electricity prices are lower without affecting the customer's preferences. The proposed approach works with a single agent to control 14 household appliances and uses a reduced number of state-action pairs and fuzzy logic for rewards functions to evaluate an action taken for a certain state. The simulation results show that the proposed appliances scheduling approach can smooth the power consumption profile and minimise the electricity cost while considering user's preferences, user's feedbacks on each action taken and his/her preference settings. A user-interface is developed in MATLAB/Simulink for the Home Energy Management System (HEMS) to demonstrate the proposed DR scheme. The simulation tool includes features such as smart appliances, electricity pricing signals, smart meters, solar photovoltaic generation, battery energy storage, electric vehicle and grid supply.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000577","Demand response;home energy management system;smart home;smart appliances;reinforcement learning;Q-learning;fuzzy reasoning","Home appliances;Load management;Power demand;Pricing;Reinforcement learning;Smart meters","","106","","30","CCBY","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing network infrastructures that require manual means of management and control cannot accommodate stringent TI constraints. With that said, the adaptation of advanced intelligent and cooperative solutions at the edge of the network is a crucial step toward guaranteed availability of resources and TI services. This article identifies and analyzes some of the technical issues that TI faces, then highlights and proposes potential solutions toward zero touch networks. We pay particular attention to the reliability performance gains achieved from cooperative edge devices, and their role in the provisioning of zero touch networking infrastructures that support TI applications.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.001.2200016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10004628","","Tactile Internet;Wireless communication;Automation;Roads;Quality of service;Manuals;Performance gain","","2","","15","IEEE","30 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Structurally, a stereo block attention module is first constructed to serially extract the channel and spatial attention portion of the real-time visual feedback. Next, the parallax attention mechanism is introduced to enable the network to excavate implicit parallax information in stereo pairs, effectively eliminating the oscillation of the network output in the presence of ambiguous visual input. Further, with the assistance of other low-cost sensors, the proposed navigation network can be expanded in some largescale application scenarios, such as sparse coral observation. Finally, underwater simulations reveal that the proposed method obtains significantly improved control effect and real-time ability, compared with other related works. In particular, based on a self-developed biomimetic robotic dolphin, collision-free simulations with a cumulative distance beyond 1000 m were carried out and validated the effectiveness and the superiority of the navigation network, where both dense and sparse targets were fully tested. The robotic dolphin can not only successfully conduct accurate coral observation without collision, but also quest the observation targets as much as possible in the area where the observation targets are concentrated.

The output from the RFID tag is the time spent by a patient at various stations in the hospital. While the output from the automated survey is an overall satisfaction index (OSI), which is the overall experience (in the form of a number) a patient has during his/her stay in the hospital. HMIS has details regarding the structure of the hospital; this includes details about doctors, nurses, rooms, location of various departments, etc. In addition, environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) from installed sensors are used to capture the physical context of the patient's experience. To develop an automated PEMS GA is used for computing the patient experience. The collected data (timing information, HMIS and sensor data) is given as input so that the GA generates optimized weights which are then applied to the final PEMS to automatically produce the overall satisfaction index best matching with OSI. This proposed framework reduces the time taken by manual statistics by automating the complete interaction of patient and hospital staff at all stations. The experiments are performed using the developed tool, in a local hospital, and the results demonstrate an accuracy of 80.3%. This accuracy gives a good indication to hospital management in real-time to take measures in areas where the patient experience is going relatively low.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9305300","Genetic algorithm (GA);hospital management information system (HMIS);overall satisfaction index (OSI);patient experience management index (PEMI);radio frequency identification device (RFID)","Hospitals;Radiofrequency identification;Genetic algorithms;Sensors;Temperature sensors;Indexes;Open systems","","8","","48","CCBY","23 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies investigating the COVID-19 pandemic forecast have either lacked generalization and scalability or lacked surveillance data. City administrators have also often relied heavily on open-loop, belief-based decision-making, preventing them from identifying and enforcing timely policies. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analyses based on closed-loop decisions for COVID-19. Combining epidemiological theories with machine learning models gives this study a more accurate prediction of COVID-19’s growth, and suggests policies to regulate it. The Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered (SIR) model was analyzed using a machine learning model to estimate the optimal constant parameters, which are the recovery and infection rates of the coupled nonlinear differential equations that govern the epidemic model. To modulate the optimized parameters that regulate pandemic suppression and mitigation, a systematically designed feedback-based strategy was implemented. We also used pulse width modulation to modify on-off signals in order to regulate policy enforcement according to established metrics, such as infection recovery ratios. It was possible to determine what type of policy should be implemented in the country, as well as how long it should be implemented. Using datasets from John Hopkins University for six countries, India, Iran, Italy, Germany, Japan, and the United States, we show that our 30-day prediction errors are almost less than 3%. Our model proposes a threshold mechanism for policy control that divides the policy implementation into seven states, for example, if Infection Recovery Ratio (IRR) >80, we suggest a complete lockdown, vs if 10¡IRR¡20, we suggest encouraging people to stay at home and organizations to work at 50% capacity. All countries which implemented a policy control strategy at an early stage were accurately predicted by our model. Furthermore, it was determined that the implementation of closed-loop strategies during a pandemic at different times effectively controlled the pandemic.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3206790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9893130","Covid-19;pandemic;policy management;SIR;machine learning;regression;control theory;transfer function","Pandemics;Mathematical models;Predictive models;COVID-19;Diseases;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Transfer functions","","4","","52","CCBY","15 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this research, we narrow the focus of a hypothetical robot assistant to a room-tidying task in a simulated domestic environment. Given an item, the robot chooses where to put it among many destinations, then optionally receives feedback from a human operator. We frame the problem as a contextual bandit, a reinforcement learning approach frequently used in Web recommendation systems. We evaluate epsilon-greedy and LinUCB action selection methods under a variety of infrequent feedback scenarios, with several methods for managing the lack of feedback. Our empirical results show that, while early-episode performance and overall accuracy of epsilon-greedy action selection can be improved through learning from no-response feedback and careful management of remembered training episodes, a baseline LinUCB approach outperforms epsilon-greedy action selection in early-episode performance, overall accuracy, and simplicity.","2375-0197","978-1-7281-3798-8","10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8995186","human in the loop reinforcement learning;contextual bandits;sparse feedback;robotics","","","","","22","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Restaurants give considerable attention to customers’ feedback about their service, since the reputation of the business depends on it. Key factors of evaluating customer satisfaction are, being able to deliver the services effectively to lessen the time of consumption, as well as maintaining a high quality of service. In most cases of selecting a prominent restaurant, customers focus on their choice of favorite food in addition to available seating and space options. Long waiting times and serving the wrong order is a common mistake that happens in every restaurant that eventually leads to customer dissatisfaction. Objectives of this online application “Foody” is to address these deficiencies and provide efficient and accurate services to the customer, by providing unique menus to each customer considering their taste. This concept is implemented as a mobile application using latest IT concepts such as Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Predictive Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. This includes graphics and 3D modeling that provide existent physical information related to food such as colors, sizes and further user can view the ingredients of the meal as well as the available tables. In addition, the app shows the real-time map to the restaurant. Current table reservation status is indicated by the color change of the table. Unique food recommendation and it’s order for each customer is generated by analyzing their social media information and the system notifies the customer the wait time by calculating it. Preparation of food and allocation is done subjectively.

First, we view the user-item interactions in a positive unlabeled (PU) learning setting and reconstruct the interaction matrix between users and warm items, detecting missing links and recommending warm items to existing users. Second, an inductive multi-target regressor is trained on this reconstructed interaction matrix and subsequently predicts interactions for new items that enter the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a two-step PU learning method is proposed to address the cold-start problem in recommender systems. To evaluate the proposed approach, we employed four benchmark datasets from movie and news recommendation domains with explicit and implicit feedback.

In this article, we propose a control framework for robot-assisted motor learning, emphasizing the detection of human intention, generation of reference trajectories, and modification of robotic assistance. A real-time trajectory generation algorithm is presented to extract the high-level features in active arm movements using an adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO) and then integrate the movement rhythm with the minimum-jerk principle to generate an optimal reference trajectory, which synchronizes with the motion intention in the patient as well as the motion pattern in healthy humans. In addition, a subject-adaptive assistance modification algorithm is presented to model the patient’s residual motor capabilities employing spatially dependent radial basis function (RBF) networks and then combining the RBF-based feedforward controller with the impedance feedback controller to provide only necessary assistance while simultaneously regulating the maximum-tolerated error during trajectory tracking tasks. We conduct simulation and experimental studies based on an upper limb rehabilitation robot to evaluate the overall performance of the motor-learning framework. A series of results showed that the difficulty level of reference trajectories was modulated to meet the requirements of subjects’ intended motion, furthermore, the robotic assistance was compliantly optimized in response to the changing performance of subjects’ motor abilities, highlighting the potential of adopting our framework into clinical application to promote patient-led motor learning.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2022.3163916","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1307000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1913601,61720106012); Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects in Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019JZZY011111); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Science(grant numbers:XDB32040000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758170","Assist as needed (AAN);motor learning;nonlinear adaptive control;rehabilitation robotics","Robots;Trajectory;Assistive robots;Adaptive control;Oscillators;Rehabilitation robotics;Real-time systems","","17","","33","IEEE","15 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a continuation of the multi-step improvement of the sensor assembly line until its full automation. Statistical control, machine learning, deep machine learning, fuzzy logic and neural networks have been applied to improve and optimize data selection and analysis. A model of digital twins is applied, in which the analysis and feedback for automatic optimal control are outside the work center of a server or cloud. With this powerful management model, many work centers are serviced. Thus, with the development of a single powerful analysis software from the machine manufacturer, many work centers can be managed. This makes the process more automatic and with a lower cost.

Currently, this problem is handled by the game theory and auction theory, since this is a problem involving multiple agents. In this paper, we propose agent-based modeling method to model this multi-agent environment and probabilistic reinforcement learning to learn the optimal strategies. We focus on a simple scenario with only one primary user (PU) and multiple secondary users (SUs), and try to maximize the revenues of both sides, which may be further extended to other scenarios with different number of agents. First, we model this environment as a monopolistic market from the perspective of economics, where a PU acts as the monopoly and the SUs are passive buyers. Then, we propose probabilistic reinforcement learning methods to handle DSA so that both the PU and SUs can behave optimally by learning from the feedback of the others.

Generally, a large number of small tasks will slow down the workflow performance due to the scheduling overhead incurs during the execution time. Task clustering is an optimization technique that aggregates multiple small tasks into a large task to reduce the scheduling overhead, and thus it will reduce the overall workflow makespan, i.e. the total execution time taken by the resources to complete the execution of all of the tasks. However, finding an optimal clustering number is a big challenge as it usually requires manual intervention of experienced researchers to define the clustering parameter. In this paper, we proposed the use of reinforcement learning to tackle this problem by automating the discovery of the optimal clustering number for the submitted workflow. First, we model the workflow environment that allows the reinforcement learning agent to interact by determining the cluster number for every round of workflow execution. Then, based on the provenance records after the execution, the workflow environment will analyze the performance data and then determine either a reward or a punishment as the feedback to the reinforcement learning agent. The evaluation experiments are performed using real-world scientific workflow (e.g. Montage in this research), to demonstrate our model capability to identify the optimal cluster number and thus lay the groundwork for the adoption of reinforcement learning in workflow task clustering.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101454","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(grant numbers:LRGS-LR002-2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502119","Clustering method;machine learning;workflow management software","Task analysis;Optimization;Reinforcement learning;Scheduling;Clustering algorithms;Processor scheduling;Monitoring","","2","","38","CCBY","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although there have been significant efforts to reduce the computational overheads of deep learning inference in such systems, previous approaches have focused on delivering ‘best-effort’ performance, resulting in unpredictable performance under variable environments. In this paper, we propose a runtime control method, called DMS (Dynamic Model Scaling), that enables dynamic resource-accuracy trade-offs to support various QoS requirements of deep learning applications. In DMS, the resource demands of deep learning inference can be controlled by adaptive pruning of computation-intensive convolution filters. DMS avoids irregularity of pruned models by reorganizing filters according to their importance so that varying number of filters can be applied efficiently. Since DMS’s pruning method incurs no runtime overhead and preserves the full capacity of original deep learning models, DMS can tailor the models at runtime for concurrent deep learning applications with their respective resource-accuracy trade-offs. We demonstrate the viability of DMS by implementing a prototype. The evaluation results demonstrate that, if properly coordinated with system level resource managers, DMS can support highly robust and efficient inference performance against unpredictable workloads.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2954546","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1D1A1B03934266); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1F1A1060959); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8907822","Deep learning;edge devices;embedded systems;energy efficiency;feedback control;filter pruning;mobile devices;model compression;quality-of-service;QoS","Deep learning;Convolution;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Runtime;Task analysis;Adaptation models","","14","","49","CCBY","20 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, as novel applications emerge in the era of 5G and beyond, unprecedented levels of complexity will be encountered in the design and optimization of the network. As a result, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is envisioned for wireless network design and optimization due to the flexibility and adaptability it offers in solving extremely complex problems in real-time. One of the main future applications of AI is enabling user-level personalization for numerous use cases. AI will revolutionize the way we interact with computers in which computers will be able to sense commands and emotions from humans in a non-intrusive manner, making the entire process transparent to users. By leveraging this capability, and accelerated by the advances in computing technologies, wireless networks can be redesigned to enable the personalization of network services to the user level in real-time. While current wireless networks are being optimized to achieve a predefined set of quality requirements, the personalization technology advocated in this article is supported by an intelligent big data-driven layer designed to micro-manage the scarce network resources. This layer provides the intelligence required to decide the necessary service quality that achieves the target satisfaction level for each user. Due to its dynamic and flexible design, personalized networks are expected to achieve unprecedented improvements in optimizing two contradicting objectives in wireless networks: saving resources and improving user satisfaction levels. This article presents some foundational background on the proposed network personalization technology and its enablers.

The machine can take different actions to interact with the user to obtain better retrieval results before showing them to the user. For example, the machine can request extra information from the user, return a list of topics for the user to select from, and so on. In this paper, we propose using deep-Q-network (DQN) to determine the machine actions for interactive spoken content retrieval. DQN bypasses the need to estimate hand-crafted states, and directly determines the best action based on the present retrieval results even without any human knowledge.

This paper demonstrates that Artificial Intelligence (AI), and especially the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR), could also be successfully employed at the start of the space mission life cycle via an Expert System (ES) used as a Design Engineering Assistant (DEA). An ES is an AI-based agent used to solve complex problems in particular fields. There are many examples of ES being successfully implemented in the aeronautical, agricultural, legal or medical fields. Applied to space mission design, and in particular, in the context of concurrent engineering sessions, an ES could serve as a knowledge engine and support the generation of the initial design inputs, provide easy and quick access to previous design decisions or push to explore new design options. Integrated to the User design environment, the DEA could become an active assistant following the design iterations and flagging model inconsistencies. Today, for space missions design, experts apply methods of concurrent engineering and Model-Based System Engineering, relying both on their implicit knowledge (i.e., past experiences, network) and on available explicit knowledge (i.e., past reports, publications, data sheets). The former knowledge type represents still the most significant amount of data, mostly unstructured, non-digital or digital data of various legacy formats. Searching for information through this data is highly time-consuming. A solution is to convert this data into structured data to be stored into a Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be traversed by an inference engine to provide reasoning and deductions on its nodes. Knowledge is extracted from the KG via a User Interface (UI) and a query engine providing reliable and relevant knowledge summaries to the Human experts. The DEA project aims to enhance the productivity of experts by providing them with new insights into a large amount of data accumulated in the field of space mission design. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) methods are leveraged to develop the DEA. Building the knowledge base manually is subjective, time-consuming, laborious and error bound. This is why the knowledge base generation and population rely on Ontology Learning (OL) methods. This OL approach follows a modified model of the Ontology Layer Cake. This paper describes the approach and the parameters used for the qualitative trade-off for the selection of the software to be adopted in the architecture of the ES. The study also displays the first results of the multi-word extraction and highlights the importance of Word Sense Disambiguation for the identification of synonyms in the context. This paper includes the detailed software architecture of both front and back-ends, as well as the tool requirements.

After conceptualizing blockchain technology, it has changed many sectors, such as health, education, and business, as well as human resource management (HRM). However, still, there are some gaps in this area. So in this paper, we are going to investigate and solve those. Hiring employees is a vital role of the human resource (HR) but it is not so easy to hire the right candidate. To hire the right candidate, checking the performance appraisals of his previous organization is a great method to know about him. HR often needs to know the candidate's performance appraisals from his previous organization as feedback, which is not as easy and trustworthy as the traditional way. A performance appraisal is a systematic way to review or evaluate an employee's organizational performance. This could be an incredible, reliable system for an organization's HR.

Furthermore, traditional evaluation methodologies are only useful in offline experiments. In this research, we propose a novel incremental model base on stochastic gradient decent algorithm for Matrix Factorization.

In the current Internet of Vehicles system, the traffic management center can learn from the feedback information of all vehicles to improve the ability of decision-making and traffic command. However, the existing feedback mechanism does not respond to the spatial-temporal characteristics of data in time, due to the lack of communication capability of the current equipment. So, it cannot meet the requirements of ultra-low delay, high reliability and high security in the Internet of Vehicles. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based proxy vote and revocation scheme for decision feedback in Internet of Vehicles, which allows the intelligent system to ignore the unevenness and heterogeneity in the 6G technology. In addition, blockchain technology notarizes the vote data of vehicles and outsources microservices. Secondly, we use the attributes of decision-related nodes instead of their identities to enable anonymous vote. Smart contracts can automatically expand the scalability of outsourced microservices. Finally, the security proof of the proposed scheme ensures the security and consistency of outsourced microservices.

In this paper, we propose a QMIX-based scheme for the cooperative path control of multiple AGVs. Although QMIX is the one of popular cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, we find that QMIX alone was not enough to increase productivity in warehouse systems. So, we develop two novel techniques that can be used with QMIX: 1) sequential action masking that eliminates all the collision cases and 2) additional local loss that improves collaboration of individual AGVs. They help to encourage the AGVs to cooperate more for high productivity. By extensive simulations, we present the superiority of the proposed scheme on several layouts in fulfillment centers. The effect of cooperation among AGVs in the proposed scheme is verified through the comparison study with the existing algorithms.

Environmental observation, home surveillance, and assistive supports are now built on wearable devices using inertia-based sensors, such as accelerometers, linear acceleration, and gyroscopes. However, previous assisted living system (ALS) still faces challenges in energy management and resource allocation when performing daily activities, particularly with ambulation. Legacy systems cannot fully improve self-esteem, hence, WearROBOT, which detects rearview obstacles and has an audio feedback system incorporated for voicing out once an obstacle is detected. Linear programing (LP) multi-commodity graph (LMCG) learning model is proposed while coupling the shortest path resource allocation for space diversity linearization. An Infrared sensor problem function that minimizes link utilization is derived. Angle-Intensity analysis (AIA) was carried out on various use case scenarios to enable the user to know the best angle to consider depending on its usage and battery conservation. This work showed how intensity differs at various angles of 5°, 15°, 20°, 35°, and 45°. Also, the reflectivity of different materials and how it affects the battery life are studied. As the wearable robot moves away from the node-obstacle, the LMCG narrow-band sensor node (LMCG-NB-IoT) drops energy significantly. The Low Power WAN (LP-WAN), Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and proposed LMCG-NB-IoT offered 51.28%, 33.33%, and 15.39% respectively. In terms of energy latency, the schemes gave 65.63%, 31.25%, and 3.12% respectively. Similarly, the proposed LMCG-NB-IoT had a 50% battery life profile.

It is known that the lack of a proper semantics for programming languages (such as C), i.e., a correctness specification for compilers, has contributed to many problematic program behaviours and security issues. While it is in general hard to have a correctness specification for compilers due to the high complexity of programming languages and their rapid evolution, we have a unique opportunity to do it right this time for neural networks (which have a limited set of functions, and most of them have stable semantics). In this work, we report our effort on providing a correctness specification of neural net-work frameworks such as TensorFlow. We specify the semantics of almost all TensorFlow layers in the logical programming language Prolog. We demonstrate the usefulness of the semantics through two applications. One is a fuzzing engine for TensorFlow, which features a strong oracle and a systematic way of generating valid neural networks.

We propose a $k$k-fold validation framework for the pairwise comparison of recommendation algorithms that learn from user feedback streams, using prequential evaluation. Our proposal enables continuous statistical testing on adaptive-size sliding windows over the outcome of the prequential process, allowing practitioners and researchers to make decisions in real time based on solid statistical evidence. We present a set of experiments to gain insights on the sensitivity and robustness of two statistical tests—McNemar’s and Wilcoxon signed rank—in a streaming data environment. Our results show that besides allowing a real-time, fine-grained online assessment, the online versions of the statistical tests are at least as robust as the batch versions, and definitely more robust than a simple prequential single-fold approach.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2019.2960216","National Funds; Portuguese funding agency; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:UID/EEA/50014/2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935156","Recommender systems;data streams;evaluation","Data models;Recommender systems;Testing;Protocols;Statistical analysis;Real-time systems;Proposals","","9","","34","IEEE","17 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Part of the analysis is used to estimate a priority for the incident to effectively assign the limited workforce on the most important events. This process is referred to as incident prioritization and it is typically based on a set of static rules and calculations. Due to shifting concepts, new network entities, different attacks or changing guidelines, the rules may contain errors, which leads to incorrectly prioritized incidents. An explicit process to even identify those problems is often amiss, let alone assistance to adjust the model. In this paper, we present an approach to adapt an incident prioritization model to correct errors in the rating process. We developed concepts to collect feedback from an analyst and automatically generate and evaluate improvements to the prioritization model. The evaluation of our approach on real and synthetic data in a comparative experiment using further, regular learning algorithms shows promising results.","","978-1-7281-2080-5","10.1109/ICDIS.2019.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855297","incident prioritization, network security, cyber security, adaptive learning","Adaptation models;Security;Communication networks;Data models;Automation;Tools;Analytical models","","3","","13","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are interested in understanding the different aspects of mobile incompatibility, their frequency of occurrence from a user perspective, and how much effort developers have spent on it. We have conducted a study on 40 randomly selected open-source mobile apps from the Google Play Store and have analyzed 258,056 commits (extracted from their version control system) to identify incompatibility issues in apps. We have also studied 205,847 reviews to identify and categorize compatibility requirements from user reviews. Both app commits and app reviews were processed by a pipeline of Natural Language Processing steps. We evaluated the efficiency of four Machine Learning classifiers to analyze compatibility. This was done by classifying commit messages and analyzing user reviews. We observed that the Logistic Regression classifier produced the best overall results. For the same data set, we classified compatibility types. In that case, the Support Vector Machine classifier performed marginally better over the other classifiers. Addressing the relative effort spent on compatibility, we found that 3.16% of the developer's effort is dedicated to compatibility issues. At the same time, we observed that 4.30% of user reviews report compatibility issues in apps. In conclusion, we see more demand for future research on (i)the gap between the time spent by the developers and the frequency of occurrence of compatibility issues, and (ii) the degree of responsiveness on actual user concerns.","","978-1-7281-8352-7","10.1109/AIRE51212.2020.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233032","Non-functional requirements, Compatibility, Machine Learning, Text Classification, Mobile apps, Developer Commits, Reviews","Mobile applications;Tools;Productivity;Testing;Internet;Performance evaluation;Software development management","","3","","39","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It would be significantly beneficial for the society in the prospect that high-quality medical service could be delivered to deprived areas and a highly promising surgical diagnosis could be achieved. However, the state-of-the-art TS systems have security, privacy, reliability, latency, and high-cost blockchain-based storage concerns, which limit the applicability of TS in surgical operations across the globe in the near future. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, we in this paper propose a novel approach named BITS an intelligent and blockchain-based TS framework. The issues pertaining to security, privacy, and lack of trust could be resolved through employing a smart contract. The issues related to the cost of data storage could be resolved by employing the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol. Moreover, we incorporate Artificial Intelligent (AI) algorithms for training of surgical robots. The proposed scheme also prevents the execution of malicious commands transmitted by an intruder to a great extent. The 6G communication channel significantly mitigates the latency issues in exchanging surgical commands.

Due to the high update rates and low replay rates of TV programs, the item cold-start problem is prominent, and this problem seriously affects the effectiveness of the recommender and limits the application of recommendation algorithms for live TV. To solve this problem better, RSs must consider information in addition to the time slot strategy, which relies on experience. At present, no methods make good use of viewing behavior records. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a viewing environment model called DeepTV that considers viewing behavior records and electronic program guides and includes a feature generation process and a model construction process. In the feature generation process, we defined seven key features by clustering viewing time, distinguishing positive and negative feedback, capturing continuous viewing preference and introducing the remaining time proportion of candidate programs. We normalize the continuous features and add powers of them. In the model construction process, we regard the live TV recommendation task as a classification problem and fuse the above features by using a neural network.

However, unless there are enough resources equipped, forgetting knowledge acquired in the past is inevitable. Then, we can naturally pose a fundamental question about how to control what knowledge and how much of it to forget to improve the overall accuracy. To give a clear answer to it, we propose a novel trainable network termed homeostatic meta-model. The proposed neuromorphic framework is a natural extension of the conventional concept Synaptic Plasticity (SP) for further optimizing the accuracy of continual learning. In the preceding works on SP and its variations, though they seek important network parameters for structural regularization, they care less about the intensity of regularization (IoR). Per contra, this work reveals that a careful selection of IoR during continual training can remarkably improve the accuracy of tasks. The proposed method balances IoR between newly learned knowledge and the previously-acquired ones rather than biasing it to a specific task or evenly balancing. To obtain effective and optimal IoRs for the real-time continual learning circumstances, we propose a homeostasis-inspired meta learning architecture. The proposed meta-model automatically controls the IoRs by capturing important parameters from the previous tasks and the current learning direction. We provide experimental results considering various types of continual learning tasks showing that the proposed method notably outperforms the conventional methods in terms of learning accuracy and knowledge forgetting. We also show that the proposed method is relatively stable and robust compared to the existing SP-based methods. Furthermore, the IoR generated by our model interestingly appears to be proactively controlled within a specific range, which resembles a negative feedback mechanism of homeostasis in synapses.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3050176","BK21 FOUR Program of the Education and Research Program for Future ICT Pioneers, Seoul National University, in 2020; Automation and Systems Research Institute (ASRI), Seoul National University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317775","Continual learning;meta learning;optimization","Task analysis;Training;Interference;Synapses;Memory management;Approximation algorithms","","","","34","CCBY","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advantage for water utilities in metropolitan areas is in managing demand, such as low pressure during peak hours or water shortages during drought. For customers, effective recommendations could save them money. This paper presents a novel vision of a recommender system prototype and discusses the benefits both for the consumers and the water utility companies. The success of this type of system would depend on the ability to anticipate the time of the next major water use so as to make useful, timely recommendations. Hence, the prototype is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network that predicts significant water consumption events (i.e., showers, baths, irrigation, etc.) for 83 households. The preliminary results show that LSTM is a useful method of prediction with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.403.

While students acknowledge the fact that the online Chemistry course is beneficial in preparing them for first year Chemistry modules, the overall completion rate of the online course remains low (∼15%) as students cite the lack of immediate response from instructor while attempting the course. To increase the level of student engagement and guide students while completing the online course, an AI chatbot is introduced. The chatbot is designed to replicate the real-time interaction between a student and an instructor. It is worth noting that the chatbot was designed not to answer the questions directly, but rather to scaffold the learning for the students and guide them towards the final answer. Beta testing results shows that students prefer a chatbot that is available 24/7 compared to a tutor that is available at limited scheduled time, as the chatbot caters to the flexibility of students' varying study schedule and preference. Encouraged by the positive results in the Beta testing, the chatbot is scheduled for full deployment in Summer 2021 to serve 280 incoming freshmen. A future study has been designed to investigate at which point students will be able to differentiate an actual instructor in synchronous communication from a chatbot.

Embodied pedagogical agents are particularly useful in teaching young learners because of the engagement, and enjoyment they engender. Teaching robots are among possibilities in the future classroom; they may also represent solutions to the looming, acute global teacher scarcity. However, their design creates unique computational challenges. Moreover, robot-human systems involving a single robot in interaction with multiple humans, are not common. PI has been reported in many studies as a learner-centered approach that supports conceptual learning, metacognition, cognitive load sharing, and higher order learning, through peer scaffolding. However, existing studies have reported only applications by human teachers in regular classrooms. This study highlights an approach for enabling a PERT as a PI facilitator. Based on conflicting reports of the significance of agent embodiment for learning, we present the report of two experimental studies from our assessment of the system, employing the mixed method approach. We compared participants' perception of the robot's social presence and teaching quality when the robot is physically present and when it is absent (voice-only). Our findings are based on data from 14 participants in each study. The Social Presence indeX (SPiX) and the teacher quality index (TQI) were used for quantitative data collection for social presence and teaching quality, respectively. Qualitative data were based on live observation and participants' open-ended feedback. Quantitative findings show no significant difference in participants' perceptions in both conditions but qualitative feedback provided more information. Our findings show: i) students are willing to accept non-human teachers, and ii) their expectations of them are similar to those for human teachers; iii) an improved affective system will promote increased presence; iv) participants noted the robot as `neutral', with important implications for culturally-responsive education; v) robot teachers could be potential technology-inspired solution to global teacher scarcity and vi) in addition to promoting deeper learning, PI can be a useful pedagogical approach for non-human teachers. This study is in line with anticipated ability of future technological advancements to support machines that are as effective as intelligent human tutors.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658445","robot teacher;embodiment;pedagogical agents;PAs;peer instruction;social presence;teaching quality","Education;Robot kinematics;Collaboration;Robot sensing systems;Indexes;Artificial intelligence","","6","","49","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, some techniques propose to train deep learning (DL) models to predict the branch coverage of an arbitrary input owing to its always-available gradients etc. as a guide. Those techniques have proved their success in improving coverage and discovering bugs under different experimental settings. However, DL models, usually as a magic black-box, are notoriously lack of explanation. Moreover, their performance can be sensitive to the collected runtime coverage information for training, indicating potentially unstable performance. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on 4 types of DL models across 6 projects to (1) revisit the performance of DL models on predicting branch coverage (2) demystify what specific knowledge do the models exactly learn, (3) study the scenarios where the DL models can outperform and underperform the traditional fuzzers, and (4) gain insight into the challenges of applying DL models on fuzzing. Our empirical results reveal that existing DL-based fuzzers do not perform well as expected, which is largely affected by the dependencies between branches, unbalanced sample distribution, and the limited model expressiveness. In addition, the estimated gradient information tends to be less helpful in our experiments.

Finally, experimental results for simulation experiments in different scenes show that the method can make multi-logistics AGV robots work together and improves the reward in sparse environments about 2.61 times compared to the SAC algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3062457","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:20YJCZH200); Beijing Youth Top-Notch Talent Plan of High-Creation Plan(grant numbers:2017000026833ZK25); Canal Plan-Leading Talent Project of Beijing Tongzhou District(grant numbers:YHLB2017038); Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission of China(grant numbers:KM202110037002,KM202010037002); Grass-roots Academic Team Building Project of Beijing Wuzi University(grant numbers:2019XJJCTD04); Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Logistics System(grant numbers:BZ0211); Beijing Intelligent Logistics System Collaborative Innovation Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9363881","Multi-logistics robot;task allocation;deep reinforcement learning;actor-critic;hierarchical reinforcement learning","Robots;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Logistics;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling","","32","","45","CCBY","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first present a model-based planning method in which it is necessary to train the state transition probabilities and the expected time intervals between adjacent decision epochs. To facilitate training them, the SMDP is degraded into a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) in which the service requests and ongoing service completions follow a continuous-time Markov chain. The relative value iterative algorithm for the CTMDP is used to find an asymptotically optimal VM allocation policy. In addition, we also propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method, where an optimal coordinated VM allocation policy is approximated by learning from the states and rewards of feedback.

The agent’s implementation uses reinforcement learning (RL). RL is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn from experimenting. The agent’s learning is based on rewards, and feedback signals proportional to how good its actions are. The simulation platform used was infrastructure interdependencies simulator, in which, we have tested suitability of the approach in previous studies. In this paper, we have added new features to our previous solution, for enabling faster convergence and distributed processing. These additions include an enhanced reward scheme and a scheduler for orchestrating the distributed training. We include two test cases. The first case is a compact model with four critical infrastructures. In this model, the agent’s training required only 10% of the attempts needed in our previous version. Improvements in convergence come from adding a shaping reward scheme. We trained the agent across 24 simultaneous configurations of our model. The training process elapsed 4 min. The extended case included more infrastructures and a higher level of detail. The dimensionality of the problem grew by a factor of 4000, but the training converged in less episodes. We tested the extended model over 96 parallel instances (potential scenarios) with completion in 2.87 min. The results show a fast and stable convergence.

Here, to reach a given target by contemporary satisfying some basic requirements like effectiveness and efficiency, it is often necessary to organize ad hoc teams of free-moving vehicles, sensors, and smart devices. Therefore, a specific issue is the adequate representation of the reciprocal agent/device trustworthiness for advantaging such team formation processes within a smart factory environment.

As a kind of deep learning framework, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has been widely used in text generation. In combination with reinforcement learning, GAN uses the output of discriminator as reward signal of reinforcement learning to guide generator training, but the reward signal is a scalar and the guidance is weak. This paper proposes a text generation model named Feature-Guiding Generative Adversarial Networks (FGGAN). To solve the problem of insufficient feedback guidance from the discriminator network, FGGAN uses a feature guidance module to extract text features from the discriminator network, convert them into feature guidance vectors and feed them into the generator network for guidance. In addition, sampling is required to complete the sequence before feeding it into the discriminator to get feedback signal in text generation. However, the randomness and insufficiency of the sampling method lead to poor quality of generated text. This paper formulates text semantic rules to restrict the token of the next time step in the sequence generation process and remove semantically unreasonable tokens to improve the quality of generated text. Finally, text generation experiments are performed on different datasets and the results verify the effectiveness and superiority of FGGAN.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993928","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2019YFB2103200); Open Subject Funds of Science and Technology on Information Transmission and Dissemination in Communication Networks Laboratory(grant numbers:SKX182010049); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:500419319,2019PTB-019); Industrial Internet Innovation and Development Project 2018 of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091179","Generative adversarial networks;text generation;deep learning;reinforcement learning","Generators;Gallium nitride;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction;Learning (artificial intelligence);Training;Semantics","","17","1","17","CCBY","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early approaches relied on utilizing each user’s first-order social neighbors’ interests for better user modeling, and failed to model the social influence diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we propose a preliminary work of a neural influence Diffusion Network (i.e., DiffNet) for social recommendation L. Wu, P. Sun, Y. Fu, R. Hong, X. Wang, and M. Wang, “A neural influence diffusion model for social recommendation,” in Proc. Int. ACM SIGIR Conf. Res. Develop. Inf. Retrieval, 2019, pp. 235–244.. DiffNet models the recursive social diffusion process for each user, such that the influence diffusion hidden in the higher-order social network is captured in the user embedding process. Despite the superior performance of DiffNet, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion process in the social network would neglect the latent collaborative interests of users hidden in the user-item interest network. To this end, in this paper, we propose DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting both the higher-order user latent interest reflected in the user-item graph and higher-order user influence reflected in the user-user graph for user embedding learning. This is achieved by iteratively aggregating each user’s embedding from three aspects: the user’s previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.

We develop the Patient Portal Engagement Framework (PPEF) to objectively and systematically evaluate patient portal engagement and demonstrated its utilization and effectiveness in two scenarios: portal utilization and user feedback. Four engagement levels included in the PPEF are - Inform Patients that allows patients to access health information; Involve Patients that encourages patients to take initiatives; Partner with Patients that supports long-term collaboration between patients and providers; and Support Ecology of Care that extends the scope beyond hospitals into personal and social factors. We find more portal utilization and user feedback focus in lower levels of patient portal engagement (i.e., patients receiving information and taking active actions in managing care). Our thematic analysis of online user reviews reveals four core themes: conflicts between system and user views, evolving benefits and needs towards patient portals, debates about balancing emotional and informational needs, and reconsideration of power, accessibility, and privacy. We discuss how PPEF can help harvest and synthesize data from the system and user levels, as well as the design implications for patient portals.

Detecting human posture is a key factor, while fall events are like a falling posture. By sequencing frames of action, it is possible to recognize a fall. Our system can clearly detect the normal lying posture and lying after falling. Our proposed method can efficiently detect action motion and recognize the action posture. We compared the performance with other standard benchmark data sets and deployed our model to simulate a real-home situation, and the correct ratio achieved 82.7% and 98% separately.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2771389","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, China(grant numbers:106-2511-S-019-003,105-2511-S-218 -003 -MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101471","IoT;fall detection;convolutional neural network;optical flow","Senior citizens;Neural networks;Streaming media;Wearable sensors;Shape","","56","1","102","OAPA","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such power control for sum-rate optimization is NP-hard, which is typically tackled by iterative algorithms such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method. However, the iterative power control schemes inherently incur high complexity and excessive latency. To overcome the limitations, we propose a deep learning-based power control scheme with reduced complexity and latency, where partial and outdated channel state information (CSI) is considered. Using a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the spectral efficiency under the constraints of user fairness and energy efficiency, where the DNN-based method is based on unsupervised learning with no label data generation process. In addition, a CSI reporting method based on the channel-to-interference power ratio is proposed for partial CSI feedback, which considerably reduces the feedback overhead. Through simulations, we show the results of the spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and fairness performance for various topographical sizes and channel correlation coefficients. Also, it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves better spectral efficiency and energy efficiency than the WMMSE scheme even when it uses a small amount of CSI feedback.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3109948","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1D1A1B07042499); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528412","Deep neural network;transmit power control;spectral efficiency;energy efficiency;index of fairness;partial channel state information","Device-to-device communication;Power control;Interference;Receivers;Deep learning;Resource management;Delays","","14","","39","CCBY","3 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If effective, this would be a valuable tool for the monitoring of personal QoE during video streaming services without asking the user to provide feedback, with great advantages for service management. Additionally, this would eliminate the bias of subjective tests and would avoid bothering the viewers with questions to collect opinions and feedback. The performed analysis relies on two different experiments: i) a crowdsourcing test, where the videos are subject to impairments caused by long initial delays and re-buffering events; ii) a laboratory test, where the videos are affected by blurring effects. The facial Action Units (AU) that represent the contractions of specific facial muscles together with the position of the eyes' pupils are extracted to identify the correlation between perceived quality and facial expressions. An SVM with a quadratic kernel and a k-NN classifier have been tested to predict the QoE from these features. These have also been combined with measured application-level parameters to improve the quality prediction. From the performed experiments, it results that the best performance is obtained with the k-NN classifier by combining all the described features and after training it with both the datasets, with a prediction accuracy as high as 93.9% outperforming the state of the art achievements.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3018303","Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR), within the Smart Cities framework(grant numbers:Project Netergit, ID: PON04a200490); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171870","Video streaming;quality of experience;facial expressions;gaze direction;machine learning;video key quality indicators;QoE estimation","Streaming media;Quality of experience;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Two dimensional displays;Face;Brain modeling","","20","","64","IEEE","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve this goal, we integrate several approaches including: 1. using trained face detection model to capture face image from input. 2. training a high accurate 468-point landmark detection model with multiple face dataset. Based on the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) table, we categorize these landmarks into 13 groups of facial regions. These regions with specific emotion labels are used as our target units of AU (Action Unit) detection. 3. training CNN model to detect and analysis AUs from facial landmark data. 4. implying FACS to evaluate the facial expressions and emotions. and 5. using a straightforward GUI plotter to show the digitized emotions.

In recent years, machine learning-based transaction monitoring systems have successfully complemented traditional rule-based systems to reduce the high number of false positives and the effort needed to review all the alerts manually. Unfortunately, machine learning-based solutions also have disadvantages: while unsupervised models can detect novel anomalous patterns, they are usually characterized by a high number of false alarms; supervised models, instead, usually offers a higher detection rate but require a large amount of labeled data to achieve such performance. In this paper, we present Amaretto, an active learning framework for money laundering detection that combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to support the transaction monitoring processes by improving the detection performance and reducing the compliance management costs. Amaretto exploits novel selection strategies to target a subset of transactions for investigation, making more efficient use of the feedback provided by the analyst. We perform the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset provided by the industrial partner, which simulates the profiles of clients trading in international capital markets. We show that Amaretto outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by reducing money laundering risk and improving detection performance. In particular, we compare state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised techniques commonly used in the AML domain with the ones implemented in this work. We show that the Isolation and Random Forests of Amaretto perform best in the task under analysis, with an AUROC of 0.9 for the first (20% better on average) and a detection rate of 0.793 for the second (30 % better on average). In addition, they are characterized by lower investigation costs computed in terms of the daily number of transactions to be examined and the number of false positives and false negatives. Finally, we compare Amaretto against a state-of-the-art active learning fraud detection system, achieving better detection performances and lower costs in all the analyzed scenarios. Worth mentioning, Amaretto improves the detection rate up to 50 % and reduces the overall cost by 20% in the most realistic scenario under analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3167699","Napier Technologies Ltd; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758694","Active learning;anti-money laundering;financial systems;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;selection strategies","Costs;Monitoring;Data models;Task analysis;Investment;Anomaly detection;Analytical models","","16","","56","CCBY","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Abundant data are generated that are required by terrestrial users. However, nowadays, the marine Internet cannot provide enough communication resources and high service quality for the feedback of those data. Thereby, fog computation is a potential method to solve this problem via data compression before transmission. To improve transmission efficiency while guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) of applications, how to efficiently schedule limited computation resources at fog nodes, such as buoys for different applications should be addressed. This article proposes an online computation scheduling algorithm to improve the communication resource efficiency with guaranteed QoS via appropriate compression. This scheme needs neither the cost function nor the constraint function at the scheduling node. What is more, the gradient information, which is usually needed in learning strategies, is not required, which is the estimation based on first-order and second-order schemes, respectively. Results show that the proposed scheme achieves the goal of improving communication efficiency while guaranteeing the data quality constraint of different applications.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3030921","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1701265); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:20ZR1423200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601283); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223663","Fog computing;maritime communications;online computation scheduling;resource efficiency","Resource management;Sensors;Quality of service;Satellites;Artificial intelligence;Transceivers;Internet of Things","","4","","32","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to directionality of mmW communication systems, misalignments between the transmit and receive beams occur frequently, making link maintenance particularly challenging and motivating the need for fast and efficient beam tracking. In this paper, we propose a multi-armed bandit framework, called MAMBA, for beam tracking in mmW systems. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm, called adaptive Thompson sampling (ATS), that MAMBA embodies for the selection of appropriate beams and transmission rates along these beams. ATS uses prior beam-quality information collected through the initial access and updates it whenever an ACK/NACK feedback is obtained from the user. The beam and the rate to be used during next downlink transmission are then selected based on the updated posterior distributions. Due to its model-free nature, ATS can accurately estimate the best beam/rate pair, without making assumptions regarding the temporal channel and/or user mobility.

Conventional LM is intrusive (ILM) which is costly and time-consuming in hardware installation. Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) option, on the other side, is relatively cheaper, ease of installation, and good scalability in commercialization values. The demand control of this approach has the potential of 20% energy-saving. In this paper, we discuss the fundamental stages of typical NILM framework and giving a taxonomy of appliance models with device signatures.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform.","","978-1-7281-7008-4","10.1109/CSEI50228.2020.9142534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142534","Data Science;Trading Platform;R-Programming","Data science;Industries;Education;Programming profession;Microsoft Windows","","4","","5","IEEE","17 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the support of modern technology, platforms have been developed and perfected that encourage the adoption of a new virtual learning paradigm. These platforms store student and teacher interactions with course resources in database engines, information that can be very relevant, but in many cases has not been processed in a way that is useful for use by teachers and students. Therefore, this study aims to implement and evaluate a dashboard for student behavior analysis and dropout prediction in Moodle. The tool will help teachers to know what students do before, during and after a class mediated by virtual platforms. In addition, it will also help students manage their learning process and easily and effectively monitor their progress in the course. Given the analytical nature of the research, exploratory analysis of the Moodle data model, evaluation of existing visualizations and design of the tool based on Moodle architecture were used to develop a dashboard of visualizations and dropout prediction. As a result, FlipMyLearning was implemented, a plugin for the Moodle platform that allows the teacher to monitor the learning process of students for informed decision making. The developed plugin contains visualizations for both the teacher and the student, divided into different sections, each oriented to monitor different aspects of the course. The research conducted shows that the visualizations generated were useful for both teachers and students who participated in the evaluation process. In addition, variables such as time spent, number of sessions and indicators related to cognitive depth and social breadth are useful variables to identify groups of students at risk of dropping out.","","978-1-6654-2358-8","10.1109/LACLO54177.2021.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725212","Learning Analytics;Dashboard;Moodle;Dropout;Prediction","Electronic learning;Databases;Education;Decision making;Data visualization;Data models;Information and communication technology","","1","","0","IEEE","8 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proactive wireless communication can facilitate minimal latency by open-loop communication, which discards traditional feedback control mechanisms. However, appropriate radio resource allocation in such proactive mobile networks has not been fully studied due to lacking channel state information (CSI) and the alleviation of multiple access interference (MAI) in multiple virtual cells. This paper aims to ensure the reliability of downlink communication by a novel radio resource allocation scheme in proactive vehicular networks with ultra-low latency. We regard data transmission success rate as the reliability indicator and propose a joint radio resource allocation model based on the “generalized closed-loop”, where anchor node (AN) uses the radio resource utilization information (RRUI) from the vehicle in the immediate past uplink as a guide to assist resource allocation. Subsequently, we study the radio resource allocation model solution on the vehicle side and the network side respectively. On the vehicle side, vehicles use the local or global data transmission experience to select the radio resource with the best quality as the RRUI. On the network side, according to the latest RRUI of vehicle and resource occupancy information, deep reinforcement learning is proposed to make appropriate radio resource allocation decisions. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the intelligent joint radio resource allocation scheme under the cooperation between vehicles and AN. When the resource load rate reaches 40%, the joint radio resource allocation scheme can achieve a data transmission success rate of more than 98%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168986","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971066); Joint Funds for Regional Innovation and Development of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20449); Ministry of Education-China Mobile Research Foundation(grant numbers:MCM 2020); National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760396","Proactive network;resource allocation;ultra-low latency;deep reinforcement learning;vehicular networks;6G","Resource management;Downlink;Data communication;Uplink;Reliability;Wireless networks;Task analysis","","8","","41","CCBY","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

False data injection (FDI) attacks are a family of new attacks that have been considered to be the most dangerous cyber-attack as it leads to cascaded bad decision making throughout the SG network, which can lead to severe repercussions. The conventional state estimation and bad data detection techniques, which have been applied to reduce observation errors and detect bad data in energy system state estimators, cannot detect FDI attacks. Here, we bring into play an objective-seeking system to act as the supervisor of the SG network. To this end, we propose to introduce a new metric for the SG: the entropic state. The entropic state has two purposes: 1) it provides an indication of the grid's health on a cycle-to-cycle basis and 2) it can be used to detect FDI attacks. Consequently, improving the entropic state is the goal of the supervisor. To achieve that objective, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the state estimation process by reconfiguring the weights of the sensors in the network. With optimality in mind, the CDS is the superior choice for the supervisory system. In this structure, the CDS interacts with the SG network, which is considered as the environment. Computer simulations are carried out on a 4-bus and the IEEE 14-bus systems to highlight the performance of the proposed approach in detecting both bad data and FDI attacks in the SG, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2922410","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735819","Bad data detection (BDD);false data injection;cognitive dynamic systems;cognitive control;cumulative sum (CUSUM);cyber-physical attack;cyber-physical systems;online estimation;smart grid;smart grid security","State estimation;Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Smart grids;Measurement uncertainty;Mathematical model;Voltage measurement","","21","","50","OAPA","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Education institutions often use learning management systems (LMS), such as Moodle, Edmodo, Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard Learn, and others. When accessing these systems with their personal account, each student's activity is recorded in a log file. Besides analyzing the raw data from log files directly, there is an option to use Moodle plugins that provide learning analytics and enable the faster analysis of students' behavior on LMS. In this paper, some of these plugins are presented. However, this paper is focused on analyzing the log files of a course implemented on the LMS Moodle at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics at the University of Zagreb.

Reactive maintenance was the main approach practiced until 1980s. The proactive maintenance was introduced in 1990s to insulate customers from equipment failures by using equipment data and fixing problems remotely. Prescriptive maintenance, which incorporates the Internet of Things, digitization and artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, has gained importance as in intelligent approach to equipment maintenance and has the potential to greatly improve upon proactive maintenance. However, existing prescriptive maintenance solutions are piece-meal and lack complete solutions to keep equipment in working conditions most of the time at optimal cost. We propose a Holistic End to End Prescriptive Maintenance (HeePMF) framework resulting in much reduced unplanned equipment downtime at optimal cost. This framework provides solution by integrating maintenance needs analysis, equipment and operational data, predictive technologies with feedback, personnel scheduling, supply chain improvement, part management, process improvement and knowledge management.

The success can be affected by several factors, but here only students' cognitive activities are examined. The predictors used in the models are based on: number of view of PDF lecture notes, number of views of video lectures, number of views of books of solved exercises, number of views of Minitab videos (videos for problem solving with a statistical software), number of attempts of quizzes and best grades achieved by students on quizzes. The models differed in the number and in the types of predictors. Binary Logistic Regression was used for model training and evaluation. The target of the models indicates whether a student is at risk of not achieving the minimum grade to pass the course. The impact of cognitive predictors that are part of the Moodle core Analytics API on predictive power was also examined. Having evaluated the goodness of the different models, it was shown that students' success can be predicted purely from cognitive activities, but their predictive powers are very diverse. The predictors of quizzes have the largest impact on the success, however, supplementing the model with other even less effective predictors much better model can be made. Models built from purely Moodle core cognitive predictors give much less reliable results.","2380-7350","978-1-7281-8213-1","10.1109/CogInfoCom50765.2020.9237894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9237894","machine learning;online learning;Moodle;student success;Learning Management Systems;Learning Analytics","Training;Analytical models;Machine learning;Predictive models;Software;Reliability;Problem-solving","","7","","31","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, we first design and develop an architecture to provide an interactive user interface. Secondly, we propose a machine learning approach based on intent classification and natural language understanding to understand user intents and generate SPARQL queries. We especially process a new social network dataset (i.e., myPersonality) and add it to the existing knowledge bases to extend the chatbot capabilities by understanding analytical queries. The system can be extended with a new domain on-demand, flexible, multiple knowledge base, multilingual, and allows intuitive creation and execution of different tasks for an extensive range of topics.

This is essential for scheduling, management and control of microgrid resources. So far, the existing STLF methodologies have been successfully used for the aggregated load forecasting in transmission and distribution systems. Nevertheless, their prediction accuracy in microgrid applications, where diversity is low and considerable changes in the load of customers can be observed in a short period of time, is not investigated.

E-Learning allows students to study via computers in their respective places without having to go to study/lectures in class physically. Moodle is a Learning Management System that is used as a medium for delivering E-Learning. The problem that often arises in e-learning is that in the learning process, students interact more with e-learning media so that teachers will find it difficult to monitor student behavior when using learning media. In fact, students in some cases tend to drop out or attend lesser classes. Moodle can capture student interactions and activities while studying online using log files. From the results of student interactions and activities on e-learning, it can be used to determine their learning style. Identifying student learning styles can improve the performance of the learning process. This research suggests an approach to automatically predicting learning styles based on the Felder and Silverman learning style (FSLSM) model using the Decision Tree algorithm and the ensemble Gradient Boosted Tree method. We've used actual data sets derived from e-learning program log files to perform our work. We use precision and accuracy to assess the results.

With the support of modern technology, virtual platforms that encourage the adoption of a new learning paradigm in which geographical/temporal limitations no longer pose a difficulty have been developed and refined. These virtual learning platforms, also known as Learning Management Systems (LMS), store student and teacher interactions with course resources, and these interactions are stored in database engines. However, all the information generated by LMS has not been processed in a way that is helpful for the use of teachers and students, mainly because in most cases, students' interactions with these systems focus on downloading class material, delivering assignments, and reading announcements, leaving aside indicators that can be presented in the form of visualizations that allow actions to be taken during the development of the learning process. Thus, this study proposes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a dashboard for the analysis of learner behavior and prediction of dropout on the Moodle platform. The proposed tool will help students to manage their learning process, easily and effectively monitor their progress in an online course, and teachers to know what students do before, during and after a virtual class.

Integration of ICT in education can contribute significantly to solving the problem. We propose a technical solution that takes into account the narrowness of the bandwidth of Internet access (actually 2 Mbps). We strengthen the capacities of the NBU in IT resources and optimize their use. In this sense, we are making the intranet functional where Leaning Management System (LMS) servers can be accessed with a throughput of at least 10 Mbps from all university sites, including university residences. Optimal exploitation techniques of the Internet resource have been applied. We have conducted a thorough analysis of the causes of slow loading of pedagogical resources and learning activities and we propose technical solutions to alleviate the LMS Moodle.

With respect to a matrix operator-filter bank that the ma-trix operator-analysis-filter bank H and the matrix operator-sampling-filter bank S are given, firstly, we introduce the detail algorithm to derive the optimum matrix operator-synthesis-filter bank Z that minimizes all the worst-case measures of the matrix operator-error-signals $\mathbf{E}(\omega)=\mathbf{F}(\omega)-\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$ between the matrix operator-input-signals $\mathbf{F}(\omega)$ and the matrix operator-output-signals $\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$ of the matrix operator-filter bank at the same time. Further, feedback is introduced to the above approximation theory and it is indicated that introducing conversations with feedback do not superior automatically to the accumulation of existing knowledge of signal prediction. Secondly, the concept of category in the field of mathematics is applied to the above optimum signal approximation and is indicated that the category-based approximation theory is applied to the set-theoretic con-sideration of the recognition of human. Based on this discussion, it is shown naturally, why the narrow perception that tends to create isolation shows an apparent advantage in the short term and, often, why such narrow thinking becomes intimate with discriminatory action in a human group. Throughout these considerations, it is presented that, in order to abolish easy and intimate discriminatory behavior, it is important create a parallel world of conception where we share the set of invisible error signals including the words and the consciousness of both worlds.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9891929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891929","signal prediction;pseudo inverse matrix;artificial intelligence for gutter between columns and","Deep learning;Measurement uncertainty;Neural networks;Oral communication;Market research;Approximation error;Approximation algorithms","","","","15","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Selective Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Domain Collaborative Recommendation","H. Zhang; X. Kong; Y.

A promising solution is to utilize feedback or ratings from multiple domains to improve the performance of recommendations in a collective way, known as the cross-domain recommendation. Cross-domain recommendation using heterogeneous feedback is a popular solution, which transfers knowledge from the more easily available auxiliary binary feedback to improve the prediction performance of the target domain. Most of the existing work focuses on the transfer of knowledge between different domains from the same website, where user behavior data in different domains can be fully shared. The existing work mainly assumes that data from different domains can be fully shared. However, due to the constraints of business privacy policies, it is difficult to directly share exactly the same user behavior data between different e-commerce websites. It results in that the user's latent factors learned in the auxiliary domain cannot be directly transferred to the target domain, otherwise, it will cause a negative transfer issue. In this article, we consider that the auxiliary domain with numerical ratings and target domains with binary feedbacks only share overlapping items rather than users. We propose a Selective Knowledge Transfer for Cross-domain Collaborative Recommendation, called SKT. The proposed SKT framework not only transfers the item's latent factors learned from the auxiliary domain to the target domain, but also selectively transfers the user's latent factors learned from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. In addition, due to the introduction of co-graph regularization of user graphs and item graphs, SKT can maintain respective intrinsic geometric structure within each domain and thus avoid negative transfer issue. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets show that our SKT method is significantly better than all baseline methods at various density levels.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061279","National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) of China(grant numbers:61772111); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups, NSFC(grant numbers:71421001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360540","Transfer learning (TL);cross-domain recommendation;selective knowledge transfer;sparsity;heterogeneous feedbacks","Knowledge transfer;Sparse matrices;Collaboration;Bridges;Transfer learning;Videos;Task analysis","","11","","42","CCBY","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In enterprise contexts, the use of chatbots seeks to reduce labor costs and consequently increase productivity. For simple, repetitive customer service tasks such already proves beneficial, yet more complex collaborative knowledge work seems to require a better understanding of how the technology may best be integrated. Particularly, the additional mental burden which accompanies the use of these natural language based artificial assistants, often remains overlooked. To this end, cognitive load theory implies that unnecessary use of technology can induce additional extrinsic load and thus may have a contrary effect on users’ productivity. The research presented in this paper thus reports on a study assessing cognitive load and productivity implications of human chatbot interaction in a realistic enterprise setting. A/B testing software-only vs. software + chatbot interaction, and the NASA TLX were used to evaluate and compare the cognitive load of two user groups. Results show that chatbot users experienced less cognitive load and were more productive than software-only users. Furthermore, they show lower frustration levels and better overall performance (i.e, task quality) despite their slightly longer average task completion time.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582445","Human-Chatbot Interaction;Cognitive Load;Mental Workload;NASA TLX;Productivity","Productivity;Customer services;Natural languages;NASA;Machine learning;Chatbots;Software","","7","","51","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the downside, this flurry of research activity, often focused on improving over a small number of baselines, makes it hard to identify reference methods and standardized evaluation protocols. Furthermore, the traditional categorization of recommendation systems into content-based, collaborative filtering and hybrid systems lacks the informativeness it once had.

An IoT cloud-based platform solution supports multiple types of data, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques. However, cloud computing has certain limitations such as increased delay in data reporting, increased latency in accessing user network, limited customization, increased reliance on external network and data privacy. Fog-Cloud and Edge-Cloud paradigms can overcome the weaknesses of cloud computing architectures.

We use AHP to determine the weights between these three factors. We then select the products we consider most successful based on the calculated product success index and found that users are most concerned about product quality, price and security. At the same time, to solve the question of whether a particular review affects subsequent ratings. We used a two-way ANOVA method to analyze whether specific reviews in the early stages would affect the stars in later stages. We found that the p-value is concentrated between 0.1-0.2, which means the specific star rating is considered to have an impact on the evaluation. Finally, we suggest that Merchants and platforms should pay more attention to the characteristics of successful products and early product feedback.

This study had done comparison design between system development from scratch and system development using existing component to prove that component-based development could be used as alternative for software development. The comparison started from development steps, strength and weakness of each methods, effort, and time. The effort and time estimation calculation were done by using adjusted story points (ASF) methods for Scrum methodology and COCOMO for CBSE methodology. To discover the flexibility of component-based development using Moodle, this study built additional component that related to the case study needs. After that, functional and nonfunctional testing was done towards the whole system which was developed using Moodle. This study also raised component addition model which could be used to integrate web-based additional component. The comparison result which was done in this study showed the development steps with component-based development were simpler than from scratch development. However, the effort estimation result for each methodology could not be compared, with the ASP value to calculate effort estimation was 1.1832 for Scrum methodology and 1.89 ManMonth for CBSE methodology from COCOMO calculation. Meanwhile, the time estimation result did not show the advantages of CBSE methodology because the calculation result was 12 weeks or 3 months for Scrum methodology and 3.18 months for CBSE methodology. The component additional model which was used to integrate web-based additional component into Moodle was successfully implemented. The evaluation result of Andalalin e-learning system showed the needs of Andalalin material learning could be fulfilled. Furthermore, the performance testing, which was done using Moodle Benchmark, found that the environment, where Moodle system was implemented, affected the system performance. From the usability testing and questionnaire result, the Moodle system was considered not difficult for respondents to use.

At each year, we modified it after students' feedback from the previous year. We determined student groups applying clustering techniques to learner performance data, independently analyzed the resulting clusters in terms of behavior, engagement, performance, and also compared those pairwise. Our analysis identified four different student groups (profiles/clusters) according to their performance and interactions with the course across all years. We found out that the best performing students were those that had significantly more interactions with course materials and consistently ranked highest. In addition, we found that performance indicators for students of all groups became stable within the first month after course start, allowing final grades to be predicted with high accuracy by then. Furthermore, all were deadline driven and became mainly active at the end of the semesters (indicating a lack of self-regulation skills).

Due to technological evolution, iVProg also evolved to iVProgH and its integration to Moodle is still possible by using the new version of iAssign that allow the integration of HTML stack packages to Moodle. In this paper we describe how this evolution takes place and presents iVProgH functionalities as well as iAssign extension to include HTML packages into Moodle.

Written customer review is a rich source of information that can offer insights into the recommender system. However, dealing with the customer feedback in text format, as unstructured data, is challenging. In this research, we extract those features from customer reviews and use them for similarity evaluation of the users and ultimately in recommendation generation. To do so, we developed a glossary of features for each product category and evaluated them for removing irrelevant terms using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, we employed a deep neural network to extract deep features from the reviews-characteristics matrix to deal with sparsity, ambiguity, and redundancy. We applied matrix factorization as the collaborative filtering method to provide recommendations. As the experimental results on the Amazon.com dataset demonstrate, our methodology improves the performance of the recommender system by incorporating information from reviews and produces recommendations with higher quality in terms of rating prediction accuracy compared to the baseline methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937518","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1560037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813018","Recommender system;review;deep neural networks;recommendation;matrix factorization;latent Dirichlet allocation","Recommender systems;Feature extraction;Sparse matrices;Neural networks;Predictive models;Resource management;Natural language processing","","44","","40","CCBY","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning is the only available solution to continue teaching during the lockdown periods. The evolution of these studies also needs to adapt to the situation. One of the significant issues with this online evaluation method is the anomalies during the evaluation process. This proposed implementation mainly focuses on anomaly detection of the Moodle environment exam systems. The proposed system produces a Moodle plugin to detect the time taken for each question in the Moodle environment examination system and detect the exam anomalies using the time variations. Then analyze and calculate the time that each candidate has taken for each question and the average time. The invigilator can see the candidates who took more than average time and less than average time and get the suspicious candidate list. The plugin also contains a separate algorithm that monitors the candidate while facing the exam. This face detection algorithm will notice the unusual behaviours of the candidate and upload the created report to the database, and the invigilator can access these reports on their loggings. To guide the candidate system, they also have an AI agent who will help to understand the exam process, give pre-defined answers for the questions, and provide contact details of the relevant authorities for exceptional cases. Also, the developed plugin detects the system information and background apps that run during the exam process and automatically creates relevant reports, and uploads them into the database. After the system implementation, the system was tested using a selected audience.

To the best of our knowledge, a predictive model that can generalize well to many different types of courses using data available in the LMS does not currently exist in the learning analytics literature. In this study, early prediction of students at risk is tackled by training a number of neural networks to predict which students would likely submit their assignments on time based on their activity up to two days before assignments' due dates. Five different datasets that cover a total of 78 722 student enrolments in 5487 courses have been used in this study. In order to improve how well the neural networks generalize, our networks can perform different forms of feature engineering using course peers data. The different architectures of these networks have been compared to find the one with more predictive power. To validate the models trained from the networks, both new datasets and unseen examples extracted from the same datasets have been used for training. Our research show that adding contextual information results in better prediction accuracies and F1 scores.

The connection with Moodle allows teachers and students to access the lab remotely using their credentials as student / teacher of a regular course. The connection between Matlab / Simulink and the experimental platform is made by converting a BiegleBone Black microcontroller card into a system that acquires signals from a shaft encoder that measures the angular position of the servo and generates the PWM outputs to manipulate a VoltPaQ X1 source from Quanser that feeds the servo motor. The Matlab / Simulink connection with the BiegleBone Black card is done using the UDP protocol with a sampling time of 0.02 seconds, in this way the control routines can be programmed directly in Matlab / Simulink. As the connection is made using aleatory access tools, it is not adequate for real time feedback loop, but only a small disturbance is observed during the first 15 seconds. This 15 seconds time interval is considered as the requisite for the system to reach a stand by position, so that the feedback control system can be initialized and ensure it works correctly in real time.","","978-1-5386-5586-3","10.1109/ICA-ACCA.2018.8609733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609733","Remote labs;Moodle;Automatic Control;MATLAB;Simulink","Matlab;Servomotors;Software packages;Shafts;Pulse width modulation;Visualization","","1","","23","IEEE","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents the implementation of AHP education using the Workshop activity supported by the learning management system Moodle. In the first part of this activity, the students have to make a paper of AHP analysis of one real strategic or tactical problem related to any organization they choose: they have to structure the problem using the structuring methods, collect pairwise comparisons from decision-makers, calculate the group priorities and make the sensitivity analysis. In the second part of the activity, the students do peer assessment – they evaluate other students’ projects using the rubrics and qualitative assessment. The analysis reveals better results in understanding the AHP when compared to traditional ways of learning (direct assessment of papers by teachers without peer assessment).

In Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (UMN), an online learning (E-learning) system is used as an additional tool to support teaching process. The E-learning system is Moodle-based with one of its features is the assignment submission. The preliminary survey shows that 23.2% respondents had committed the act of plagiarism when doing assignments in E-learning in the past. Due to the lack of plagiarism detection feature in Moodle-based E-learning system, thus this research proposes a plagiarism detection feature as a plug-in for the E-learning system. The plagiarism detection plug-in handles assignments that are in the format of text documents. The plug-in makes use of Winnowing algorithm for fingerprinting the assignment documents and the hashing technique chosen for the Winnowing algorithm is Rolling Hash. The similarity value is calculated using Jaccard Coefficient. As a demonstration of feasibility, the implementation is done in Moodle-based E-learning UMN. The test results show the combinations of parameters (k-gram, window length, and the base prime number) for the plug-in and the f-measure. The plug-in successfully detects plagiarism on student assignment in E-learning UMN.","","978-1-5386-5892-5","10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466429","E-learning;Jaccard Coefficient;Plagiarism;Rolling Hash;Winnowing","Plagiarism;Electronic learning;Fingerprint recognition;Testing;Mathematical model;Feature extraction;Computer science","","7","","25","IEEE","20 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the last few years, gamification has been widely used to improve learning experiences in various environments. Education is one of the fields that adopted gamification as technological innovation to increase student engagement since it plays a critical role in higher education, especially in digital learning environments. Today, learning management systems (LMSs) are commonly used to facilitate learning processes. However, the engagement and the motivation of students when using such systems require extra attention. There is a need for an instructor to incorporate digital technologies with esteemed innovations to create an engaging learning environment. Increasing students' engagement is said to be evidence of increased learning. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by designing, developing, and evaluating a gamified collaborative discussion environment on the moodle LMS. To achieve this, the students in a postgraduate course used a gamified online discussion environment for eight weeks during group work to complete their term projects. Students' online learning pre-test and post-test data are utilized to investigate students' engagement in a gamified discussion environment. The results illustrate that there is a significant difference between pre-test and post-test results, which shows that the gamified online discussion environment has improved students' engagement. Furthermore, students that highly accessed the online course activities had a good engagement, which motivated students to conduct online collaboration according to the game-feature context.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8754666","Gamification;collaborative environment;online discussion environment;moodle","Education;Games;Collaboration;Bars;Tools;Color;Technological innovation","","33","","54","CCBY","3 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Background: Despite worries about their pedagogical effectiveness, lectures remain the main instructional method in university classrooms. Introducing active learning into the classroom can be difficult due to class sizes and the challenge of providing appropriate scaffolding to individual students. This article shows that a thoughtful deployment of today's learning technology can help in structuring a whole course as a set of activities, which can improve students' engagement in the classroom. Intended Outcomes: With this full engagement in the classroom, students' affective and learning attitudes as well as their learning performance are expected to improve. Application Design: Moodle was used to design learning activities for second-year students taking a digital logic design course in an electrical and computer engineering program. Throughout the semester, the students used the class time entirely to complete these activities and reflect on them. The instructor's role in the classroom was limited to interaction with individual students or teams to clarify any questions. He did not give any lectures during the term. Findings: A total of 103 students took this course in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019. The students showed a strong acceptance of the presented instructional design. Their evaluation of individual learning activities was consistently positive and their performance in the final exam has improved considerably compared to the previous offerings of the course.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2020.2989921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9098921","Active learning;Moodle;quizzes;students’ engagement;students’ perceptions","Adders;Task analysis;Education;Springs;Hardware;Videos;Logic design","","23","","29","IEEE","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

People can take advantage of portable edge terminal devices and use the geographic information in LBSN to arrange or adjust their travel plans. However, due to the explosive growth of current Internet applications and users, it has brought greater pressure and operation and maintenance costs to cloud storage. It is a key research direction based on location recommendation to accurately obtain the places of interest of users and push them to clients in such a large amount of original data. In order to better process the data generated by edge devices, this paper firstly uses the Rank-FBPR matrix decomposition framework based on social network to analyze the user's personal preference function on the edge server. Then interact with the geographic information stored in the Cloud to cluster the POIs. And embeds the geographic information into the framework to get the candidate points of interest. Finally, the scores of candidate points of interest are predicted using the personal preference function and power law distribution, then a sorted list of points of interest is generated in descending order of scores, and the list is recommended to the target user. This algorithm effectively integrates the time information and geographic information of users' check-in in the LBSN, and proposes a POIs recommendation algorithm that comprehensively considers edge devices and Cloud. The experiments verify the effectiveness of framework from both cold start and non-cold start. The experimental results on the Foursquare and the Yelp datasets show that Rank-FBPR has higher recommendation accuracy and recall than other comparison models, and can adapt to cold start problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979922","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602323); National Postdoctoral Foundation of China(grant numbers:2016M591455); Youth Seedling Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:lnqn201913); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2019MS264); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031336","LBSN;edge computing;personal preference","Clustering algorithms;Servers;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Matrix decomposition;Real-time systems;Social network services","","12","","21","CCBY","10 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In parallel, with the advent of Industry 4.0, a tight integration of Internet of Things technologies and Big Data analytics solution has become necessary to effectively manage industrial processes and to early predict product faults or service disruptions. In the context of good transports, the development of smart monitoring tools is particularly useful for couriers to ensure effective and efficient parcel deliveries. However, the existing predictive maintenance frameworks are not tailored to parcel delivery services. We present REDTag Service, an integrated framework to track and monitor the shipped packages. It relies on a network of IoT-enabled devices, called REDTags, allowing courier employees to easily collect the status of the package at each delivery step. The framework provides back-end functionalities for smart data transmission, management, storage, and analytics. A machine-learning process is included to promptly analyze the features describing event-related data to predict potential breaks of the goods in the packages. The framework provides also a dynamic view on the integrated data tailored to the different stakeholders, as well as on the prediction outcomes, enabling immediate feedback and model improvements. We analyze a real-world dataset including event-related data about parcel transports. To validate the hypothesis that the acquired data contains information relevant to predict the package status (i.e., broken or safe), we empirically analyze the performance of different, scalable classifiers. The experimental results confirm, in good approximation, the predictive power of the models extracted from the event-related features. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first attempt to address predictive maintenance in smart good transport logistics to predict package breaks from real-world data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966568","Politecnico di Torino; Regional Funds for Regional development; Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR); Regione Piemonte(grant numbers:POR FESR 2014-2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8959207","Big data analytics;Industry 4.0;intelligent transports and logistics;Internet of Things;machine learning;predictive maintenance","Predictive maintenance;Logistics;Big Data;Monitoring;Machine learning;Internet of Things;Predictive models","","25","","41","CCBY","14 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, this plug-in applies the k-means machine learning algorithm to cluster the learners based on their common learning behaviours in a specific course. To evaluate the accuracy of the personality identification based on the clustering results, a pilot was conducted at a public Tunisian university with 23 learners enrolled in an online course. The obtained results highlighted that the BA plug-in clustering has a good accuracy rate which is 65% in predicting extraversion personality.

The problem arises in many applications, such as friend recommendation, news feedback, and product recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem. The existing online social network link prediction algorithms have some deficiencies in link prediction accuracy because they cannot make full use of information or capture all the features. From an unconventional perspective, this paper formulates the link prediction problem as a matrix denoising problem. We first propose an unsupervised marginalized denoising model (USMDM) and explain in detail its effectiveness. The core of the USMDM lies with a mapping function that is capable of identifying patterns in a vast amount of user information and also understands the topological structure of social networks. The mapping function projects the observed matrix onto a target matrix. To improve efficiency and prevent overfitting, a low-rank matrix is used to replace the original matrix in the learning process. Using the weak law of large number, the function can be learned on limited datasets. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experiments are conducted on four real social networks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912662","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2017MG022); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71672103,61572104,71501113); Tianjin Science and Technology Development Strategic Planning Research Program(grant numbers:17ZLZDZF00240); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695687","Social networks;link prediction;matrix denoising;weak law of large number","Social networking (online);Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Noise reduction;Adaptation models","","5","","51","OAPA","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The introduction of multiobjective in the TSP is a very important research topic, which brings serious challenges to the TSP. Currently, genetic algorithms (GAs) are one of the most effective methods to solve the multiobjective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP). However, GA-based algorithms suffer the premature convergence, the insufficient diversity, and nonuniform distribution of solutions when solving the MOTSP, which further restrict the wide application of GA-based algorithms. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes an improved method for GAs based on a novel evolutionary computational model, named the Physarum-inspired computational model (PCM). Based on the prior knowledge of the PCM, the initialization of the population in the proposed method is first optimized to enhance the distribution of solutions. Then, the hill climbing (HC) method is used to improve the diversity of individuals and avert running into the local optimum.

It was shown that the highest accuracy of 82.35%, AUC and Cohen kappa with values of 0.766 and 0.706 were achieved with the Linear SVC algorithm for predicting student's performance. However, the challenge we faced is the lack of data, where three ways to achieve the most accurate performance model are presented. Also, we examined importance of considering significant attributes that influence student performance prediction results.","1847-358X","978-953-290-117-7","10.23919/SoftCOM55329.2022.9911469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911469","e-learning systems;prediction;student performance;data mining","Machine learning algorithms;Electronic learning;Education;Static VAr compensators;Tutorials;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","3","","16","","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the volume of information may be overwhelming, or only part of the lessons may be relevant for an individual; thus, the need for customized curricula emerges. We introduce a Moodle plugin developed to help learners customize their curriculum to best fit their learning needs by relying on specific filtering criteria and semantic relatedness. For this experiment, a Moodle instance was created for doctors working in the field of nutrition in early life. The platform includes 78 lessons tackling a wide variety of topics, organized into five modules. Our plugin enables users to specify basic filtering criteria, including their field of expertise, topics of interest from a predefined taxonomy, or expected themes (e.g., background knowledge, practice & counselling, or guidelines) for a preliminary pre-screening of lessons. In addition, learners can also provide a description in natural language of their learning interests. This text is compared with each lesson's description using Cohesion Network Analysis, and lessons are selected above an experimentally set threshold. Our approach also takes into account prior knowledge requirements, and may suggest lessons for further reading. Overall, the plugin covers the management of the entire course lifecycle, namely: a) creating a customized curriculum; b) tracking the progress of completed lessons; c) generating completion certificates with corresponding CME points.","","978-1-7281-7628-4","10.1109/SYNASC51798.2020.00037","National Institute for Health Research(grant numbers:NF-SI-0515-10042); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357085","Curriculum Customization;Learning Management System;Cohesion Network Analysis","Filtering;Scientific computing;Navigation;Taxonomy;Semantics;Natural languages;Medical services","","2","","15","IEEE","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online Education is becoming more and more disseminated in the present day, though it still has a hindrance concerning student assessment. This work presents a solution to create large Question Banks (QB) with parametric questions. This parametric question feature allows you to create more elaborate QB, where there are no duplicates of similar questions; Besides, it allows you to easily generate many variations when rendering an exam for a student. These QB are generated through an innovative solution adapted to the open-source web system MCTest. There one can settle the automatic production of numerous test variations that may even come in thousands. Then MCTest emails the QB to the user in two formats, Aiken and XML, which can be imported by another system, e.g. by Moodle for a quiz. For the second academic term of 2020 a Brazilian federal university decided to offer all of its courses in the distance learning format. One of them is called Networks and Communication (NC), which takes twelve weeks in total, and a professor is applying weekly quizzes on Moodle in order to prepare the students for the main exams. A total of 91 students of NC were assigned to this professor, 45 of them in the morning and 46 in the evening.

Currently, one of the main problems is the lack of knowledge about the proper application of gamification elements and the high costs of implementation during virtual classes. There are several elements available in Moodle to implement and possibly not all are relevant to students. The objective is to define the main elements that motivate students, to explain the Open Source elements of gamification available in Moodle, and how to implement them. To achieve the goals a test class with 10 gamification elements was developed. An experiment was carried out with approximately 50 students from the Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo. As a requirement, students must have prior use of Moodle.

Thus, defining and using contextual information may help to improve the predictive monitoring of business processes, which is one of the main challenges in process mining. However, identifying this contextual information is not an easy task because it might change depending on the target of the prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology named CAP3 (Context-aware Process Performance indicator Prediction) which involves two phases. The first phase guides process analysts on identifying the context for the predictive monitoring of process performance indicators (PPIs), which are quantifiable metrics focused on measuring the progress of strategic objectives aimed to improve the process. The second phase involves a context-aware predictive monitoring technique that incorporates the relevant context information as input for the prediction. Our methodology leverages context-oriented domain knowledge and experts’ feedback to discover the contextual information useful to improve the quality of PPI prediction with a decrease of error rates in most cases, by adding this information as features to the datasets used as input of the predictive monitoring process. We experimentally evaluated our approach using two-real-life organizations. Process experts from both organizations applied CAP3 methodology and identified the contextual information to be used for prediction. The model learned using this information achieved lower error rates in most cases than the model learned without contextual information confirming the benefits of CAP3.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044670","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:645751 RISE_BPM); Spanish Government through projects HORATIO and OPHELIA(grant numbers:RTI2018-101204-B-C21/C22); Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293289","Business process management;process mining;predictive monitoring;context awareness;process indicator prediction","Monitoring;Predictive models;Data mining;Companies;Task analysis;Process control","","11","","41","CCBY","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the education world, testing and data are driving decisions for what knowledge and skills students should be learning and how students' learning relates to their learning outcomes. On that occasion, a better option for building a machine learning model is to get effective data preprocessing concepts. For these reasons, this paper describes the very first step of the main research work which considers the correlations between students' academic performance, behavior and personality traits to reveal the presence of an intriguing way. Intuitively, this paper proposes the uses of Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) in the preprocessing stage to collect and analyze of students' data from multiple data sources. In this system, data is collected from multiple data sources based on the structures which are used as a testbed. Students' demographic data and assessment results from Student Information System (SIS), logs of their interaction with Moodle are used for data collection. Then aggregating with Web logs also captures student behavior that is represented by daily summaries of student clicks based on courses and by their actions.","","978-1-7281-5925-6","10.1109/ICCA49400.2020.9022824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9022824","machine learning;data preprocessing;ETL;multiple data sources;demographic data;assessment results;Moodle logs;Web logs","Data warehouses;Data models;Data mining;Big Data;Data analysis;Education;Buildings","","5","","10","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To validate this assumption, we present an exploratory study on software team member configuration when resolving issues. We mine the JIRA issue tracking system to assess whether different team member configurations are quicker to resolve issues after being reopened. In a case study of Moodle, our results confirm that the combinations of team members in different roles correlate with reopened issues and the changing of team members is found to resolve those reopened issues.

Generally, learning analytics methods focus on data analysis about the performance of learners and the interaction with the learning environment. A key characteristic that may impact negatively or positively the learner performance is their emotional state. Considering the learner's emotions during the learning process may enhance the learning experience by improving the motivation and the engagement of the learners. Furthermore, depending on the sociocultural context to which they belong and through which they have evolved, learners transmit, control, and regulate their emotions in different ways. These cultural variations need also to be considered when dealing with emotions. In this paper, we will first explore the idea of emotion and its relations with learning, collaborative learning, and culture.

Nevertheless, the acquisition of programming skills is not an easy task. This fact is corroborated by the literature that report alarming failure and dropout rates in CS0 (Introduction to Computer Science) courses. On the other hand, forecasts about the demand for software developers indicate exponential growth over the next decade.In this context, reducing the cognitive workload for learners is desirable. For instance, the integration of a web-based environment with some visual programming tool and automatic assessment could benefit learners.The adoption of a unique environment where the students could learn how to solve problems using algorithms and receive immediate feedback may reduce the slope of the learning curve. Moreover, the possibility of using the same tool to communicate with their teachers and colleagues can positively affect their learning.Also, the visual programming paradigm can reduce the need for memorization of a programming language syntax. It allows learners to focus their attention on solving the problem algorithmically.There are several tools that provide automated assessment evaluation. Some of these can be used with Web browsers, but very few of them can be integrated with a Learning Management System (LMS). In this workshop, we will discuss two of these systems that are distributed as free software: the Virtual Programming Laboratory (VPL) and the iVProgH/iAssign solutions. They can all be integrated with the Moodle platform.Since VPL demands an extra installation of the jail server (to run students solutions) and works with traditional programming languages, the focus will be over iVProgH/iAssign. The iVProgH/iAssign solution implements the Visual Programming Paradigm. iVProgH is implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, sparing the use of a security environment to separated compilation, as VPL demands.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028445","programming languages;visual programming;introductory programming course;learning;teaching;iVProgH;Moodle","Programming;Visualization;Software;Tools;Education","","","","0","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Brazil, this number reaches 50%. This rate is attributed to several factors, whether internal (learning a language with syntactic and lexical rules, developing logical reasoning and solving problems) or external factors (lack of infrastructure and high workload). Allied, in Brazil, only 10.3% of young people speak the English language, a fundamental language for reading error messages returned by compilers or interpreters. Since the beginning of computer education, several researches have been carried out to find ways to help students in the learning process. One of the proposals is to use automatic feedback techniques, which seek to create automatic messages about student results. One kind of automatic feedback is to improve compiler error messages.

Data-driven event and alarm management have the potential to reduce human operator cognitive burden. However, the high complexity of events, the data semantics, and the large variety of equipment and technologies are key barriers for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to raw SCADA data. In this context, this paper proposes a methodology to convert a large volume of alarm events into data mining terminology, creating the conditions for the application of modern AI techniques to alarm data. Moreover, this work also proposes two novel data-driven applications based on SCADA data: (i) identification of anomalous behaviors regarding the performance of the protection relays of primary substations, during circuit breaker tripping alarms in High Voltage (HV) and Medium Voltage (MV) lines; (ii) unsupervised learning to cluster similar events in HV line panels, classify new event logs based on the obtained clusters and membership grade with a control parameter that helps to identify rare events. Important aspects associated with data handling and pre-processing are also covered. The results for real data from a Distribution System Operator (DSO) showed: (i) that the proposed method can detect unexpected relay pickup events, e.g., one substation with nearly 41% of the circuit breaker alarms had an ‘atypical’ event in their context (revealed an overlooked problem on the electrification of a protection relay); (ii) capability to automatically detect and group issues into specific clusters, e.g., SF6 low-pressure alarms and blocks with abnormal profiles caused by event time-delay problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190398","National Funds National Funds through the Portuguese Funding Agency, FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:LA/P/0063/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826735","SCADA;power system protection;data-driven;digital substation;alarm message;contextual knowledge","Relays;Semantics;Synthetic aperture sonar;Natural language processing;Circuit breakers;Terminology;Standards","","6","","37","CCBY","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The high parallel computing capabilities of GPUs greatly accelerate computation-intensive applications. And the number of GPUs on single computing node is scalable, which greatly improves the computing capacity of the cluster under the condition of limited cluster size. However, there is a lack of the effective load-balancing scheduling model in multi-GPU hardware environment. This article proposes AEML, an acceleration engine for multi-GPU load-balancing in distributed heterogeneous environment. AEML can effectively integrate GPUs into distributed processing framework and achieve great load-balance among multiple heterogeneous GPUs. We propose a heterogeneous task execution model based on multiple GPUs and multiple streams (MGMS), which can effectively balance the workload of multiple GPUs. MGMS model utilizes four core techniques: a fine-grained task mapping mechanism, a device resource unified management scheme, a novel resource-aware GPU task scheduling strategy, and a feedback-based streams adjustment scheme. The implementation of AEML system is based on Spark 3.0.0 and NVIDIA CUDA 10.0. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of AEML with multiple typical benchmarks. Experimental results show that AEML can fully exploit the computing power of GPUs and achieve great load-balance among multiple heterogeneous GPUs.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2021.3084407","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1701400,2018YFB0203804,2017YFB0202201); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92055213,61873090,L1924056); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442941","Distributed system;GPGPU;heterogeneous environment;load-balancing;multi-GPU","Graphics processing units;Task analysis;Load modeling;Sparks;Hardware;Computational modeling;Processor scheduling","","9","","33","IEEE","27 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the advancement of virtual learning environments (VLEs), successful interaction depends on solutions that enable efficient communication between the student and the educational context. One way to achieve this goal has been to use chatbots to respond to students' questions in the educational field. This has become possible through artificial intelligence and natural language processing embodied in simple service platforms. The purpose of this article is to develop a chatbot that interacts with students through text messages, on subjects in a closed context, to students' doubts about the Higher Education Institution Course. To validate chatbot performance, it will be submitted to a set of questions of the same context that were not correctly answered in the previous interactions.

Students are more focused on practicing such questions on online websites by giving mock tests. By analyzing the data, we can infer about the strategies used by students to attempt the test and identify answers which were guessed correctly. Such analysis can further assist in developing a feedback system that motivates students to enhance their performance by identifying their weaknesses and strengths.

Previous studies have examine factors that improves employee participation, motivation and engagement that leads to the employee intentions to use gamification for training. Therefore, in this study, task technology fit (TTF), social motivations (SM) and knowledge gain from using gamifiction were investigated. The TAM is enhanced with other factors; such as the task technology fit (TTF) and social motivation. The TTF is used to examine gamification utility, while social motivation is used to examine social influence (SI) and social recognition (SR). Data were collected in two phases, in the first phase 375 data were used for the TAM, secondly, 31 data were used for the pre and posttest. A structural equation model were presented to test the TAM while the t-test were used to study the knowledge gain from using the gamification system. However, the foundation for understanding instructors' behavior in this study's context are: (1) perceived usefulness and attitudes are crucial to the continuance intentions to use gamified Moodle for training; (2) perceived usefulness mediates the relationships among social recognition, TTF, perceived ease of use, and social influence on continuance intentions; (3) when predicting continuance intentions, TTF, social recognition, social influence, and perceived ease of use are vital; (4) TTF positively affects perceived ease of use; and, unexpectedly, (5) the TTF and social influence have no significant effects on perceived usefulness.

This work also multiple stages of our approach for informal testing used to capture the learning parameters for Dyslexic students. The first stage i.e. data collection has two approaches where the first approach pertains to a smaller age group of 8-10 years with limited parameters whereas the second approach pertains to the age group 11-13 years i.e. grades 6-8 with more parameters. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been used to perform Speech-to-Text (STT) conversion on the audio responses of the users. The analysis of these responses have been performed in python language. To detect whether the user has LD (Dyslexia in this case) or not, Machine Learning (ML) is used. Two ML algorithms namely Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to perform binary classification with LD (1) and Non-LD (0) as the two classes of the dataset.

The ESP course enabled the developers to achieve a higher degree of professional focus than conventional ESP textbooks provide. This paper focuses on the design of the course syllabus, its organization in LMS MOODLE, and analysis of the two year approbation of both experimental ESP course and Database Systems course given in English. Although the results of the first year ESP course approbation were successful, the survey conducted at the end of the first year teaching DB course in English highlighted some problem zones. This resulted in modifying the way of teaching the ESP course during the second year approbation. In particular, some elements of the flipped classroom methodology were introduced with the aim of allocating more time for discussing complex concepts of the discipline in class so the students become familiar with them in advance while doing their homework. The results of the survey conducted at the end of the second year approbation as well as the results of the second year DB course acquisition are discussed. Authors conclude that online component of the experimental ESP course makes it more flexible, allows adopting it to changing requirements of DB course lecturer which can be achieved only in case of close interdepartmental cooperation.

This paper proposes a novel analysis of data obtained from Moodle’s Activity Log using Learning Analytics techniques and different clustering algorithms. The main goal is to understand the students’ task-related behavior, to generate a comprehensible model, and to comprehend how it is related to their academic performance. The students were grouped using a single feature calculated for each task the students must complete in the course. The results show that this single feature is enough to model the students’ behavior and their academic performance. Different clustering algorithms and number of clusters were used, and K-Means algorithm with three clusters achieved the best result. These three groups are comprehensible and explain the students’ behavior according to their activity in the task’s submission. The clusters also have a direct relation to the students’ final grade in the course, being one of them composed of students at risk of failure.","","978-1-6654-7087-2","10.1109/ICECET55527.2022.9872960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9872960","Educational Data Mining;Learning Analytics;Clustering;Learning Management System;Moodle;Student Performance","COVID-19;Correlation;Pandemics;Clustering algorithms;Behavioral sciences;Data mining;Task analysis","","1","","18","IEEE","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several studies show that the retention rates for such courses are high among the students in the introductory classes all across the globe. With the ever-increasing demand from the industry for professionals with programming skills, higher education institutions pressure the teachers for more positive results.The same demand for more efficiency and effectiveness is common in every sector of the industry, including software. DevOps is a software development methodology largely adopted by the software industry, that promotes the continuous improvement of the software development process. This methodology simplifies the problems across all development stages and promotes cooperation supported by the automation of tasks through tools and well-defined flows.This paper presents a method that explores the possibility to improve the process of teaching-learning computer programming, by recurring to the principles of DevOps to create an improved approach able to individualize learning and reduce the teacher’s effort. A Moodle-based platform was developed with several mechanisms that 1) automate tasks such as providing learning materials and exercises to each student, controlling the performance of the work, and providing feedback to student and teacher; 2) allow teachers to receive quick feedback and focus on what really matters, i.e., the difficulties of the students, the preparation of new learning resources for each student or group of students; and 3) let the students practice and study at their own pace. A pilot experience took place with one teacher and the students of an introductory course of Programming. Although preliminary and with the participation of a reduced number of students, the obtained results are promising.","2472-7687","978-1-6654-8442-8","10.1109/EAEEIE54893.2022.9820399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820399","Teaching-learning computer programming;DevOps;Moodle;Teaching efficiency;Code Runner","Industries;Visualization;Automation;Education;Europe;Software;Encoding","","","","11","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What kinds of questions should be asked (multiple choice, short answer, etc.)? These are only a few of the many different questions. In addition, educators have always had to contend with the possibility that some students might cheat on an examination. It is widely known that students are often times more technologically savvy than their professors. So how does one prevent students from cheating on an e-assessment? Understandably, given the amount of information available on e-assessments and the variety of formats to choose from, choosing to administer e-assessments over paper-based assessments can lead to confusion on the part of the professor.

The survey respondents were picked by a combination of online surveys and personality tests, and then the questionnaire they were given included both closed- and open-ended items. The numbers of university and secondary school portals have recently seen an upward trend. So, to better investigate the abilities of teachers and learners to identify the efficiency of dominating content delivery methods, a hybrid approach of the exploratory study was employed. Students and faculty, 140 each who have taken web-based learning at 25 Indian institutions, are sampled using a snowball sampling methodology. The results of the t-test demonstrated a considerable divergence in teaching-learning impressions between faculty and students on three manifests ($\mathrm{p} < 0.005$). Learners' responses differed from faculty responses, and statistically significant differences were found, such as scientific material can be taught effectively online, improved technocratic pedagogy is the core part of e-learning, reliance on computers/connectivity.","","978-1-6654-1509-5","10.1109/CCGE50943.2021.9776386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776386","Moodle;Remote Centers;Technocratic Pedagogy;Virtual learning","COVID-19;Electronic learning;Education;Atmosphere;Logic gates;Market research;Reliability","","5","","29","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As this measurement has a great impact on the results of statistical models in LA, its estimation is crucial. In the literature, there are many strategies for estimating the duration, which do not represent the actual online time of the students. In this article, we combine LMS log files of our students with parallel screen recordings and automatically analyze for how long the LMS is present in the video. We visualize the results and show that common online time estimation strategies do not represent the online time for our students accurately.

Most research papers studying and predicting student performance in MOOCs are done on proprietary data sets that are not anonymized (de-identified) or released for general study. There are no standardized tools that provide a gateway to access usable data sets; instead, the researcher must navigate a maze of sites with different data structures and varying data access policies.

The objective of our research is to introduce a data-driven investigation to determine students' learning behaviour in a computer science course. Our research uses a variety of techniques such as Clustering (K-Means), and Classification (Decision Tree Induction) in order to achieve the goal to discover data-driven knowledge from the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) and the Student Information System (SIS). The analysis was carried out using log data obtained from Moodle and student's information obtained from the SIS in a computer science course. The study collected demographic profiles of students studying a course in Information Systems and Analysis and compared them to find answers to questions such as how student's engagement to online activities and accessing learning resources impact students' success rate and hence improving retention rate by identifying students need on time.

Background: Previous studies identified difficulties that blind and deaf students face in accessing digital content for learning. General guidelines and specific tools are available to help educators adapt digital content and existing learning platforms for access by students with varying abilities/capacities. Such tools are usually for a specific disability rather than a range of capacities, and few provide empirical evidence of effectiveness. Intended Outcomes: The engineering-related digital content adapted using the techniques described in this paper should enable blind and/or deaf students to use an oscilloscope, understand communication channels, and distinguish the different types of telecommunication networks. Application Design: The Moodle learning platform was adapted using existing e-learning accessibility standards so that digital LOs could be automatically presented in formats accessible to blind and/or deaf students. This model is extendable for other types of disabilities, helping educators adapt existing content for access by students with differing capacities. The teacher adds content (in non-auditory and non-visual formats to describe content otherwise inaccessible to deaf or blind students) and students upload reusable profiles/metadata describing their specific accessibility needs to connect to suitably adjusted content. Findings: Learning improvement with the adjusted platform was evaluated via multiple choice pre- and post-tests.

In this course, students need to work with hardware and software to achieve various learning objectives. For full advantage, the hands-on experience should be aligned with the acquisition of related concepts and procedural knowledge. The alignment of conceptual learning with hands-on experience is a big challenge, in general, and for distance learning, in particular. This article describes how different learning technologies can be integrated to achieve such alignment for embedded systems in a distance learning mode. A framework for active, lecture-free learning was established using a learning management system, YouTube, various web resources, a hardware kit, and a software development environment. The learning activities were implemented as ungraded quizzes on Moodle with different types of questions. These include review questions, conceptual questions, procedural questions, brainstorming questions, code analysis questions, and code creation questions. Our students used the provided hardware kit and the software development environment to complete the learning activities throughout the semester without listening to any live or recorded lecture from our end. This instructional design was evaluated by analyzing learning data generated by Moodle as well as self-report data. The results show high student engagement and positive perceptions of the course content and the learning method. We believe that the proposed pedagogical framework of this design is of general value and can be adopted in other engineering courses with similar requirements of hands-on experience in distance learning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3065248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9374477","Distance learning;embedded systems;learning management systems;student engagement;lecture-free instruction;COVID-19","Computer aided instruction;Embedded systems;Hardware;Software;Education;Pandemics","","25","","51","CCBY","10 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One reason is that computer graphics requires a diverse range of skills such as 3D spatial reasoning, programming, mathematics, problem solving, and design. Researchers have tried to address the problem by applying different teaching methodologies (e.g. top-down versus bottom-up) and developing specialised teaching tools. However, most of these tools have been predominantly academic projects with no long-term usage, it is difficult to create new content for them, and they are usually not useful for assessment. We have adapted CodeRunner, a free open source question-type plug-in for Moodle, to OpenGL assignments and used it for classes with more than 300 students. Results were overwhelmingly positive and students perceived the tool as having significantly improved their learning. However, students criticised the static view of OpenGL output, the lack of formative feedback, and the inability to experiment with OpenGL code. In this paper we present three extensions to our CodeRunner OpenGL teaching tool: interactive 3D renderings on the web-based client, extensions to the Moodle templates enabling formative feedback, and sandboxes for experimenting with OpenGL code. Student feedback suggests that these extensions significantly improve the usefulness of the application.","","978-89-950044-4-9","10.23919/ELINFOCOM.2019.8706402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8706402","computer graphics;teaching tools;formative feedback;automatic assessment;OpenGL;teaching;learning","Tools;Three-dimensional displays;Education;Programming;Rendering (computer graphics)","","8","","36","","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

OER (Open Educational Resources) and MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are discussed. Experimental engineering skills and abilities can be developed by using remote labs and simulations. The development of critical thinking of engineer students takes place while students work with virtual resources, and students need to understand what kind of results they get for each experiment. Even if it addresses the same problems-by differentiating the simulation laboratories-it focuses on another field: not the ability to do this, but how you can do it. Online laboratories are also fundamental to the experiments the student performs in the individual study because they are specially designed for distance students who need to gain an introductory knowledge and familiarity with real-life phenomena. The instructional design model is based on the ADDIE model, which includes the phases of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. VLEs are used to make online interactions between Students and Teachers. Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) is known as an online course management system (CMS).

The feedback system detects and diagnoses existing and emerging problems within the groups based on their interaction patterns. Based on principles of pedagogy and educational psychology, analysis metrics and appropriate measures are provided for different types of feedback including mirroring for exploratory and informative prompts providing appropriate information about progress and actual state for the teamwork, and guiding prompts aiming to modify the interaction and collaboration of a team or an individual student. The distributed feedback system consists of three essential components: Moodle-based learning management system along with various prompts implemented as Moodle plugins, Learning Analytics Backend, and Rule-based Intervention System based on an expert system. We describe, on an architectural level, the distributed feedback system and its components. As a result, we show measurements of two long term experiments carried out in two online courses at university level with a duration of one semester each.

With the advent and increasing usage of self-hosted online learning platforms like Moodle, universities need innovative ways to engage students to make learning tasks interesting, personally relevant and, hence, motivating. Gamification or ""use of game elements"" in education is one such innovation that has been found to support motivation and completion of tasks in a timely manner. However, research reveals the increasing need to differentiate game experiences by personalizing game designs for different player typologies or ""user types"" based on different motivational orientations. This study is based on experiences of students in an IT course in education, where the learning platform in Moodle was modified by implementing certain game elements such as narratives, avatar development and thematic badges. Data were collected through online questionnaires filled by student teachers, which aimed at identifying their predominant gamification user-types using an instrument based on the Hexad Player Type framework for gamification design. Based on the information gathered from these questionnaires, the course material was designed to better fit the characteristics of the major user types, and relevant recommendations were provided to the students for approaching the course material. The results show the predominant gamification user types in this group of students to be Philanthropist (motivated by purpose) and Socializer (motivated by relatedness). Similarities and differences of the predominant user types in this group are discussed in relation to different participant groups from similar studies carried out in different contexts. The study calls for further investigation of purpose and relatability as motivation factors when designing IT-related courses for students in education. Collectively, these results could be used to inform the design of online and blended learning platforms to improve the interest, engagement and motivation of learners.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962592","gamification;user-types higher education;teacher education;blended learning","Technological innovation;Instruments;Avatars;Education;Games;Hybrid learning;Task analysis","","3","","27","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Student interactions in courses delivered through learning management systems (LMS) are stored in event logs. Each event corresponds to some action performed by students on course content. Process Mining (PM) techniques allow extracting knowledge from the event logs generating the trace, that is, the ordered set of events of a given student in a course. PM can also obtain the process models generated from the traces. Process models show where students started and ended their paths, enabling them to characterize possible behaviours. It shows that each student can behave differently, generating different sequences. Applying Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) techniques make it possible to extract sequential patterns and discover sequences of similar events. Thus, this article aims to present the results of applying PM and SPM techniques to verify and analyze the students' learning paths in an introductory programming course. For this, a log of Moodle events was collected, which went through data selection and cleaning, and segmentation. The Moodle event log stores data that allows exploring information on three levels: (1) activity-type, (2) activity, and (3) action in the activity. Thus, the study aimed to investigate which activity-types, activities, and actions were performed and in what order. Among the applied techniques are those to obtain: event log statistics, process models with the Directly-Follows Graph algorithm and event sequences with the Generalized Sequential Patterns algorithm. The results showed that the students had distinct behaviors when accessing and performed the activities. Overall, we highlight the following two main findings that enabled a better understanding of the different behaviors: (i) verifying process models of Levels 2 and 3 attributes allows to deepen the analysis in the flow of the events of the activities; (ii) The subsequences of interest extracted via SPM can complement the analysis of the students' behaviors.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637146","Educational Process Mining;Sequential Patterns Mining;Learning Behaviour;Learning Analysis","Learning management systems;Analytical models;Conferences;Cleaning;Programming profession","","1","","25","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Department of Otolaryngology, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine(PCM) has introduced the online Google Classroom (GC) to the fifth-year medical students, in the academic year of 2019. The main purpose of the online GC may be applied to the flipped classroom for the fifth-year medical students. Due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic situation at the time of this academic year, each rotation should get a different learning method. Therefore, it appeared that the second to the seventh rotation from total 8 rotations learned by blended education. Face to face manner of teaching was applied first then it was switched to online GC. After that, the eighth rotation came at the same time of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, they were switched to the online GC only. It may be very hard if the online teaching has not been prepared before the time comes. The purpose of this study was to report the result of the application of GC and difference between group of the second to seventh rotation and the group of eighth rotations. How, the first rotation was not included in the study since they had opportunity to learn only face to face procedure. Methods: This is a descriptive prospective study by data collection from 86 medical students of the second to eighth rotations while the eighth rotation studied 100% online. The variable data, including a general information, satisfaction, and tools for accessing the GC were obtained from the questionnaires given to the second to the eighth rotation of the fifth-year medical students. Besides, the daily quiz (DQ) created and evaluated by the second-year residents were preformed and analyzed for the relationship with multiple choice question marks, slide quiz marks, objective structured clinical examination marks and practical marks. Moreover, the questionnaires regarding the comparison between the Google Classroom and the Moodle (MD) were also given to the sixth to eight rotations. Results: From evaluation (of the full mark of 5) of satisfaction and usage, it was found that the satisfaction was 4.7, difficulty to access was 3.2, suitability of DQ was 4.5 as well as the content of pedagogy, bedside teaching and OPD teaching conform with DQ was 4.5. Information through GC was useful by 4.2. Convenience to do SDL through GC was 4.5. Preferring to do SDL through GC was 4.5 and believe that GC could reduce paper consumption was 4.8. Comparison between GC and MD, there were 66.7% (26/39) of students who answered the evaluation with 96.1% preferred GC. Among these, 80.8% thought GC was easier to access, and 76.9% thought GC was more user friendly than MD. Correlation analysis by Pearson correlation, it was found that rotation was related to slide quiz (p = 0.010) and PBL marks (p < 0.001). Those who had more numbers of answering quizzes would gain higher quiz marks (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Using of the blended education to familiarize students, faculty and support staffs with learning management system are important since if 100% online teaching is needed. The change from face to face to online could be easily performed.

Twenty topics have been defined on which students could work in groups of 3-5 people and create a tutorial that would be made available to the rest of their peers. We have developed a Python script that processes a set of metrics such as concurrent connections, relationship between connections and students as well as between members of the groups and periods of connections. From this kind of interactions, we have related the degree of participation of each student, how each group has been involved, when the students of the same group have met in Moodle at the same time, and the grades obtained. In the PBL, 56 students have participated and at the end of the process we have obtained feedback from 38 students through a Likert-type survey. The results of the virtual monitoring show that peer-to-peer learning and continuous interaction among the members of the PBL groups reduce the isolation of the students in virtual environments and favor the successful completion of the course.","","978-1-6654-7464-1","10.1109/SIIE56031.2022.9982317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982317","e-learning;peer-to-peer learning;project-based learning (PBL);learning management systems;learning analytics","Measurement;Electronic learning;Federated learning;Education;Virtual environments;Collaboration;Tutorials","","","","13","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several strategies that can be used before, during and after face-to-face classes. Flipped classes are a way to save time in activities that can be better done in the form of previous work - guided by the teacher. And the time gained in person can be used in tasks that are much more productive than traditional lectures. This study is based on an introductory programming semester of post lockdown COVID-19, initially with 101 students, with the strategy of providing study materials for students to work on before class (as in flipped classes). We use attendance in classes, access-work MOODLE, the two grades obtained during the semester, as well as some information about the student (age, course, gender, previous knowledge of programming languages), and the level that the students think it was their presence in classes and on MOODLE in the middle and at the end of the semester to measure the success of the experiment. It seems that this type of strategy can be excellent for students who attend classes weekly and do their homework, but it can be a cause of dropout if taken to the extreme.","","978-1-6654-9011-5","10.1109/ICICA56942.2022.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071004","programming fundamentals;novice students;flipped classroom","COVID-19;Computer languages;Education;Task analysis;Programming profession","","","","55","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional teaching model of the subjects of initiation to programming is based on a set of tasks that usually result in a series of difficulties for the students which leads to an exhaustive monitoring by the teachers. It turns out that one of the main problems is that students often do not know if their work is correct (i.e. whether it works for a pre-defined data set) until it is reviewed and evaluated by the teacher. In this context, the Virtual Learning Environment becomes an attractive and interesting tool to help teach (and learn) programming. One of these tools is VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) a plugin of Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). We believe that the use of VPL may represent a paradigm shift for students, but also, and especially for teachers, because teachers will have to spend much more time upstream to prepare tasks and activities, test the environment and verify validation of the data. However, it is important to note that downstream teacher effort can significantly reduce because students do not need as much attention given that feedback on the quality and functionality of the code developed is immediate. This work is a part of a PhD in Research at Information Technology in the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and has been developed from the last 12 months. This Ph.D. research aims to analyze the VPL's integration potential in the programming teaching-learning process in higher education. It also aims to verify if, with VPL, it is possible to make student's learning more effective and autonomous, with less time and effort spent by teachers in assignments evaluation. In the present article, we will present a work-in-progress where we will show how VPL was introduced in a teaching-learning process supported on JAVA programming. The teaching method uses EduScrum methodology and is included in the course of Computer Engineering of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP / P.PORTO). The first results of this process will be presented.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399261","Teaching programming;Virtual Programming Lab;EduScrum;Real-time validation;automatic assessment;innovation","Programming profession;Education;Task analysis;Tools;Servers;Java","","13","","16","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"AttenFace: A Real Time Attendance System Using Face Recognition","A. Rao","International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",2022 IEEE 6th Conference on Information and Communication Technology (CICT),"4 Jan 2023","2022","","","1","5","The current approach to marking attendance in colleges is tedious and time consuming. I propose AttenFace, a standalone system to analyze, track and grant attendance in real time using face recognition. Using snapshots of class from live camera feed, the system identifies students and marks them as present in a class based on their presence in multiple snapshots taken throughout the class duration. Face recognition for each class is performed independently and in parallel, ensuring that the system scales with number of concurrent classes. Further, the separation of the face recognition server from the back-end server for attendance calculation allows the face recognition module to be integrated with existing attendance tracking software like Moodle. The face recognition algorithm runs at 10 minute intervals on classroom snapshots, significantly reducing computation compared to direct processing of live camera feed. This method also provides students the flexibility to leave class for a short duration (such as for a phone call) without losing attendance for that class. Attendance is granted to a student if he remains in class for a number of snapshots above a certain threshold. The system is fully automatic and requires no professor intervention or any form of manual attendance or even camera set-up, since the back-end directly interfaces with in-class cameras. AttenFace is a first-of-its-kind one-stop solution for face-recognition-enabled attendance in educational institutions that prevents proxy, handling all aspects from students checking attendance to professors deciding their own attendance policy, to college administration enforcing default attendance rules.","","978-1-6654-7312-5","10.1109/CICT56698.2022.9998001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998001","real-time attendance;face recognition;software architecture;deep learning","Face recognition;Software algorithms;Manuals;Cameras;Real-time systems;Software;Information and communication technology","","12","","14","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relevance of the chosen topic is due to the fact that the study of the dynamics of students’ academic performance during the transition to a distance format in a pandemic COVID-19 provides an opportunity to explore the benefits of this form, as well as identify problem areas. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were set and solved: the students’ academic performance was monitored at the end of the fall and spring semesters of 2019-2020 (i.e. before the beginning of distance learning and after the end of the academic year in the distance format) to identify the dynamics of success and clarify its correlation with such indicators as gender, year of study (graduation or non-graduation), speciality profile. A survey of students was conducted to study the attitude to e-learning and identify the most popular platforms and tools for distance learning. Based on the results of monitoring and survey, the specifics of Generation Z in terms of academic performance in e-learning is analysed and recommendations are developed. The study confirmed the hypothesis that representatives of Generation Z show higher academic performance in e-learning compared to the traditional form. The results of the survey showed that most of the respondents have a positive attitude to e-learning, although they consider it as a temporary option in a crisis. The main advantages of e-earning students consider the ability to focus on specialized subjects and flexible time planning for learning; the main disadvantages are the lack of real communication and instant feedback.

At various stages in the learning process, emotions can have an impact on the learner. Positive emotions could act as a catalyst during learning while negative emotions could act as a resistor. As educators, it is crucial to consider learners’ emotions during their learning process. Educators need to design their teaching methods/ practices adapting to learner emotions. For this, emotions need to be assessed. Assessment can be done during physical classes where educators assess through their tacit knowledge. However, it is quite impossible for educators during online classes. This research focuses on assessing learner emotions during online learning by analyzing learner behavioral patterns using behavior theories. Data for the analysis is obtained from event data in Moodle Learning Management System.

Moreover, we perform separate observations of this influence depending on whether the student is enrolled in the course for the first time, or if they are retaking it after failing to pass in previous academic years. The results show that a correlation exists between raw volume of interactions with the LMS and final grade, but only for first-time students.

Unfortunately, most studies in literature present their results using the default parameter settings. This study investigates the extent to which parameter optimization affect the performance of vulnerability prediction models. To evaluate our procedure, we conducted an empirical study on three open-source vulnerability datasets, namely Drupal, Moodle and PHPMyAdmin using five machine learning algorithms.

Many “smart” services are implemented in university campuses such as smart lighting, tracking and parking by using environment, security or safety sensors to detect motion, smoke, fire or water; automate the opening/closing of doors or lighting and monitoring university equipment [1]. However, these functionalities can be extended to the university Learning Management System (LMS) that is a centralized educational platform used by most universities to host, create, and deliver online courses to students. In this paper, we discuss the integration process between LMS and IoT, its importance in the education sector and its main applications. We emphasize on a “security” enhancement feature to be added to an existing university LMS, to meet the urgent need of secure access to campus events and reduce the risk of emergencies and public safety threats.

In the context of covid-19, one of the barrier gestures being social distancing, face-to-face classes have been suspended. Many higher education institutions that were not prepared for e-learning suddenly switched to online courses in order not to lose the academic year. Students no longer have the follow-up that they had when they were learning face-to-face. The chatbot proposed in this work could help reduce the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the students' level. To allow learners to have a standardized learning environment, we have developed a plugin of the Moodle learning environment using the chatbot based on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) of Artificial Intelligence.

At the same time, an increasingly bigger proportion of learning happens online. When creating exams or exercises for students in such a setting, teachers often face the following issues: (1) having to create exercises for multiple platforms, (2) lack of support for creating complex exercises, and (3) having to transfer exercises between platforms. To solve these issues we created a platformin-dependent tool for creating e-learning exercises and exams. The system relies on the structured Markdown format, which is then parsed and exported to learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, or to PDF. Scripts can be used to fully customize and randomize the Markdown exercises for each student, which mitigates cheating through copying answers, and enables holding exams that students take asynchronously. Overall, we argue that as digital learning ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex, educational institutions and teachers should strive more strongly for platform independence. In this study, we demonstrate how this can be done with exams and exercises.","2161-377X","978-1-6654-9519-6","10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853729","E-learning;learning management system;MOOC;exercise creation;online exam;platform independence","Learning management systems;Electronic learning;Ecosystems;Education;Data science;Programming profession;Faces","","2","","10","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conversion was made to conform with the social distancing measures implemented as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of relying on pre-recorded lessons, the lab was offered through live video sessions. Multiple cameras were used to make it easy for students to follow the instructor performing the experiment. Students worked together in teams they had chosen at the beginning of the semester throughout the entire course, giving team members the opportunity to get to know each other or strengthen existing bonds. During the live sessions, the teams were repeatedly sent to breakout rooms to discuss and vote on questions related to the execution of the experiments and the measurement results. The votes, which were carried out using the Moodle learning management system (LMS), were then discussed in the plenary, and the course of the experiment was adjusted accordingly. Using data of student participation from the LMS and the results of a detailed survey, the success of the implemented measures can be proven empirically. 88.2 % of students found that the interactive elements helped them to stay concentrated during the live sessions. 79.6 % agreed that the breakout rooms improved cooperation within their team and 72.8 % plan to stay in touch with their team members.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637206","COVID-19;distance learning;electronics lab;teamwork;undergrad education;video conference software","COVID-19;Learning management systems;Electronic learning;Atmospheric measurements;Pandemics;Conferences;Particle measurements","","2","","22","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the most of multimedia and web contents, whether they are educational or leisure, are not accessible for persons with hearing loss. In this line, this paper presents an interactive system aimed at automatically generating video summaries and performing subtitles synchronization for persons with hearing loss. Our proposal relies on an educational platform (MOODLE) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide an environment fully configurable for these persons. The module that generates the video summaries uses techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), whereas the synchronization module is based on forced alignment between audio streams and text.

However, this growth is predominantly due to large-scale utility size power plants, being distributed generation on residential and commercial installations only a small fraction of it. This reduced growth on small scale PV systems is primarily attributed to the lack of qualified designers and installers, and the low awareness among the general public on the benefits of solar generation. To help tackle this problem, the development of an integrated e-learning platform is under way, which will provide differentiated courses for each objective group.

They enable teachers to publish educational materials and students to use them. Since students are not allowed to publish materials, they are turning to alternative ways of sharing information, most commonly through social networks. However, this approach of sharing information has a number of flaws such as poor content structure, lack of filtering options, and the fact that information shared by senior students are not available to their junior colleagues. This paper introduces the application whose purpose is addressing the aforementioned issues. Apart from functionalities that facilitate management and organization of content being shared, the application also has implemented gamification elements that encourage continuous use by students. With an aim to examine to what degree the application is accepted by students, an empirical study was carried out.

This paper presents a case study of using STACK in a third-year mathematical engineering module. STACK is an advanced computer-assisted assessment tool that can automatically mark mathematical equations. STACK is a Moodle plugin that allows students to enter mathematical formulae as answers. It checks if the student's answer is mathematically equivalent to the model answer and can provide hints to the student. Students attempt the same question several times, getting hints with each incorrect attempt. STACK questions were used in three different settings: short practice problems that students did at home; long tutorial sessions that students did in class; a two-hour semester test. This paper reflects on the use of STACK during a semester. It summarises feedback from students that were collected during interviews, it discusses systemic challenges when implementing STACK questions, and it looks at the mark distribution of STACK-based questions. Overall, STACK proved to be a useful formative assessment tool. The immediate feedback allowed all the students to solve all the tutorial problems before the end of the tutorial session. The downside to using STACK during the semester test was that students were became anxious because they immediately knew when their answers were wrong.","","978-1-6654-7528-0","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC54384.2022.9996276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996276","Computer-assisted assessment;STACK questions;STEM assessment","Computational modeling;Tutorials;Mathematical models;Problem-solving;Interviews;Engineering education","","1","","12","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asynchronous discussions are an important part of each e-learning system since they allow students to choose when they will be included in the discussion. Numerous studies specifically encourage student-student discussion in which students are freer to express their opinion than in a professor-student discussion moderated by a professor. The sample consists of 135 students, 75 of whom are students of ZSEM, and 60 of them are from FTS. All of them are in the first year of their college education. The analyzed discussions are conducted in the Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle on courses English Language (FTS) and Information and Communication Technologies (ZSEM). Student-student discussions are in English (FTS) and in Croatian (ZSEM). The methodological approach taken was to measure the amount of Netspeak elements in the discussion. Netspeak is a language form that generates itself from a spoken and a symbolic language. It is developing very rapidly and through the use of new technologies such as Skype, Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp, etc. Its main feature is the extensive use of abbreviations, emoticons, and punctuation. In order to conduct quantitative analysis, the methodology for measuring the frequency in using Netspeak elements through ten standards was used. These standards are divided into four following groups: standard related to information and communication technology (ICT), Grammar and syntax (G), Prosody (P) and Others (O). The difference in the use of Netspeak elements will be analyzed between both groups, particularly differences between the type of standards used, between different languages and genders. Also, the correlation between using Netspeak elements and the final grade on the course will be calculated. It is expected that both groups of students will have Netspeak elements in their discussions, but that there will be some differences in the standards they use.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028574","Netspeak;asynchronous student-student discussion;Faculty of Technical Sciences;Zagreb School of Economics and Management","Standards;Information and communication technology;Economics;Grammar;Correlation;Discussion forums;Education","","1","","19","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of Universities, the following services are used, among others: email, a content management platform such as Moodle and shared cloud storage spaces such as Drive or Dropbox [6]. Through these services, teachers store work materials, assessment tests, student identification, assessment results and personal data. This is the way to ensure that each actor gets access to just the functionality granted by the system administrator. Currently, it is considered that using a single step method, particularly the use of a username/password pair, is not enough to ensure safe access. Therefore the use of a second authentication factor is required. Two-factor authentication factor (2FA) can be implemented in software or in hardware. This paper shows a survey of the situation at the University of Salamanca. Further, different alternatives for the implementation of a second authentication factor are proposed, analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each method.","","978-1-6654-3703-5","10.1109/JICV53222.2021.9600397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9600397","security;authentication;Universal Second FactorAuthentication (U2F)","Latches;Standards organizations;Authentication;Public key;Organizations;Hardware;Software","","1","","9","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Popular LMS platform such as Blackboard and Moodle are normally adopted by many education institutions. But the usage of LMS as a teaching and learning tool often overlook the suitability of the teaching taxonomy based on the difference learning style of student. In general, LMS will treat all the students in the similar manner and overlook the preferences of learning style of student. Hence, the objectives of this paper are to integrate a proper teaching taxonomy based on the student learning style when developing the teaching materials which later being used in the LMS platform. The motivation of the research is driven by theories which claim that by providing an appropriate teaching material which matches the preferences of a student learning style, it will help to increase the learning performance. The process of matching the teaching taxonomy and student learning style is defined as personalization. The research methodology involved includes literature review, applied statistics method and also survey. The experiment is conducted in a lab environment which consists of 150 students from the background of Arts and Social Sciences. The experiment is followed by a questionnaire feedback for further analysis. The results indicate that when a proper teaching taxonomy matches with the learning style of a student, it will increase the learning performance of the student.

In the Operations Research subject, the difficulty in appropriating the concepts of Linear Programming was diagnosed. As an alternative solution, it was proposed to implement the hanged and sudoku games as reinforcement mechanisms and the crossword puzzle as an evaluation instrument. To do this, the students collaboratively constructed a glossary of terms related to the topic. For the implementation of these activities, the Moodle platform was used. An exploratory-descriptive quasi-experimental design was developed through the implementation of a survey that collected students’ perception of recreational activities.

Choosing relevant personalisation criteria for each course can reduce the effort and time required by course instructors to prepare learning materials to satisfy personalisation strategies. This paper presents an approach to select relevant parameters to personalise different courses in a curriculum based on the learning materials in each course. Two metrics are described in this process based on the semantic mapping between learning materials, annotated with specific elements of the Learning Object Metadata (LOM) standard, and dimensions of different personalisation parameters. These metrics, which are automatically calculated, have been implemented using a course on a Moodle platform.","","978-1-6654-2534-6","10.1109/ECAI52376.2021.9515116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515116","ontology;personalisation criteria;metadata;e-learning;learning management systems","Measurement;Computers;Annotations;Semantics;Learning (artificial intelligence);Standards","","","","9","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The university traditionally uses technological tools such as Moodle’s, Learning Management System (LMS) and its different applications, which requires students to develop different skills than those who attend face- to-face classes only or with some virtual components. The objective of this research is to propose the formulation of educational strategies that incorporate neuroscience and neurolinguistics programming in the construction of learning in students of the Computer Engineering Career of the UNED. Furthermore, it was found that learning styles and models are not present in any of the courses of the TIC and Engineering Area, which is why it is proposed on this paper, to carry out a test in a group of students to detail how they learn. Students learn in three different ways: auditory, visual or kinesthetic. Offering alternatives in pedagogical mediation according to the way students learn, in a group where the PNI is applied and then analyze with another group in which standard and regular strategies were applied will help to conclude if the PNI improve in some way the interaction between professors and students and the approval percentage of the course.","","978-1-6654-3703-5","10.1109/JICV53222.2021.9600317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9600317","neurolinguistics programming;neuroscience;distance education;alternative strategies","Visualization;Learning management systems;Neuroscience;Engineering profession;Computational modeling;Instruments;Tools","","","","10","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, delivering personalised course learning objects based on student's preferences is still a challenge. Current mainstream recommendation algorithms, such as the Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF), deal with only two types of entities, namely users and items with their ratings. However, these methods do not pay attention to student's preferences, such as learning styles, which are especially important for the accuracy of course learning objects prediction or recommendation. Moreover, several recommendation techniques experience cold-start and rating sparsity problems. To address the challenge of improving the quality of recommender systems, in this paper a novel recommender algorithm for machine learning is proposed, which combines students actual rating with their learning styles to recommend personalised course learning objects (LOs). Various recommendation techniques are considered in an experimental study investigating the best technique to use in predicting student ratings for e-learning recommender systems. We use the Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) to represent both the student learning styles and the learning object profiles. The predicted ratings are compared with the actual student ratings to determine the accuracy of the recommendation techniques, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics. This approach has been experimented on 80 students for an online course created in the MOODLE Learning Management System. The results of the experiment show that the best recommendation technique is our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm that combines the collaborative filtering and the content-based filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of the predictions, and solves the cold-start and the rating sparsity problems using the FSLSM representations of the student learning styles and the learning object profiles.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935417","Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport; De Montfort University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798626","Collaborative filtering (CF);content-based filtering (CBF);e-learning;Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM);hybrid filtering (HF);rating prediction;recommendation system","Electronic learning;Recommender systems;Collaboration;Prediction algorithms;Measurement","","37","","95","CCBY","14 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the educational assessment of a student's interaction, the measurement of student attentiveness is an indispensable component of it. The need for a high method for assessment also arises in the development of new technology in the mode of a new style of learning. The students experience in using the LMS Moodle for e-learning (electronic learning) so that the students get the full advantage by interacting of this technology and their learning skills increase to a high-level by using learning analytics as discussed in this report. The story explores the applicability of the Raspberry Pi development board or single board computer for teaching enhancement, IoT technologies and environments. The goal of this research is to identify and propose low-cost, efficient and flexible platform which can assist in introducing the IoT paradigm in the teaching process, as considerably as to offer the Provision to fellow students about social behavior and fellow's approachability by using Learning Management System (LMS).","","978-1-5386-8046-9","10.1109/ICBDSC.2019.8645598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8645598","IoT;Big Data;Raspberry Pi;Learning Management System;Smart Classroom;Learning Analytics","Internet of Things;Electronic learning;Learning management systems;Monitoring;Tools","","27","","37","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to strong political incentives, both at the national and university levels, many tools have been massively deployed: digital learning management systems (e.g. Moodle), collaborative digital platforms (e.g. Google Meets, Microsoft Teams and Zoom), social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) and even the telephone. While the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential role of digital technologies in higher education, major issues arise regarding the quality of distance education, the learning process itself and the assessment of knowledge and skills. In this study, 81 engineering students in France were followed during several periods of containment in order to provide some answers to these questions. The results of the various knowledge tests carried out at a distance show that the students obtained local scores similar to those expected from face-to-face teaching. According to the results of the satisfaction surveys, for 91.4% of students who had sufficient hardware and software resources, the synchronous approach to e-learning presented few barriers. For the 8.6% of students affected by the digital divide, telephone communications and social networks played a major role in the learning process.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453887","COVID-19;synchronous e-learning;remote knowledge acquisition and assessment","COVID-19;Teleconferencing;Social networking (online);Pandemics;Education;Collaboration;Tutorials","","25","","30","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The online activity attributes were extracted from the activity logs stored by Moodle. A total of 885 records from undergraduate students taking three 3 different courses under 16 different classes were utilized. First, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the hyperparameters for a top performing NN model which then served as baseline classifier. Afterward, experiments were conducted to test the performance of the model for predicting student outcomes (pass or fail) both for the midterm and finals period using activity data generated prior to the midterm period. Results indicate that only low prediction performance can be achieved at an early stage, more specifically during the first month of the course. However, both accuracy, as well as ROC_AUC score, improves as more data is accumulated up to the third month. This result supports the findings from previous studies. The highest accuracy achieved for predicting finals outcomes for a single course is 91.07% with ROC_AUC score of 0.88 while for midterm outcomes the highest is 80.36% accuracy with ROC_AUC score of 0.70.

This shortcoming could in many cases have a negative impact on the prediction power of both the EDM and LA based approaches. To address such issues, this work proposes an evaluation approach that automatically compares several clustering methods using multiple internal and external performance measures on 9 real-world educational datasets of different sizes, created from the University of Tartu’s Moodle system, to produce two-way clustering. Moreover, to investigate the possible effect of normalization on the performance of the clustering algorithms, this work performs the same experiment on a normalized version of the datasets. Since such an exhaustive evaluation includes multiple criteria, the proposed approach employs a multiple criteria decision-making method (i.e., TOPSIS) to rank the most suitable methods for each dataset. Our results reveal that the proposed approach can automatically compare the performance of the clustering methods and accordingly recommend the most suitable method for each dataset. Furthermore, our results show that in both normalized and nonnormalized datasets of different sizes with 10 features, DBSCAN and k-medoids are the best clustering methods, whereas agglomerative and spectral methods appear to be among the most stable and highly performing clustering methods for such datasets with 15 features. Regarding datasets with more than 15 features, OPTICS is among the top-ranked algorithms among the nonnormalized datasets, and k-medoids is the best among the normalized datasets. Interestingly, our findings reveal that normalization may have a negative effect on the performance of certain methods, e.g., spectral clustering and OPTICS; however, it appears to mostly have a positive impact on all of the other clustering methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014948","University of Tartu ASTRA Project PER ASPERA; European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162041","Educational context;clustering methods;multiple criteria decision-making;educational data mining;learning analytics","Clustering methods;Clustering algorithms;Task analysis;Decision making;Education;Size measurement","","14","","62","CCBY","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents and evaluates a gamification approach that utilizes software engineering tools to motivate CS students to start and finish PAs earlier. Background: CS can be difficult to learn because students often struggle with errors and how to properly test their code. For these reasons, it is essential that students start their PAs early. Furthermore, software engineering tools, such as version control and unit testing, are increasingly important for students to learn early in their career. Intended Outcomes: This gamification approach aims to motivate CS students to start and complete PAs earlier, as well as instill software engineering best practices. Application Design: To motivate students to start and finish assignments early, an open-source gamification system called the Leaderboard was developed. Using gamified points, the Leaderboard rewards students who pass PA unit tests well before the assignment is due. The system is fully automated using Github Classroom, a build server, and the Moodle learning management system. Findings: Results indicate students who used the Leaderboard did not start assignments significantly earlier; however, they finished assignments earlier, committed code more frequently, and passed more unit tests. The students found the Leaderboard to be motivating and passing unit tests was exciting for them.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2021.3069945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9403918","Computer science (CS);gamification;leaderboards;learning management systems (LMSs);motivation;study behaviors;unit testing;version control","Testing;Software development management;Software engineering;Tools;Programming;Games;Data structures","","12","","43","IEEE","13 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the automatic modeling of learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students' Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior to those reported in the related literature.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8659191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8659191","","Learning management systems;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Adaptation models;Visualization;Machine learning","","11","","19","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These role-permissions assignment rules, as well as the types of system users and system functionalities, evolve over time. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks. We demonstrate our methodology using a study of four popular real-world systems: 1) MediaWiki; 2) Moodle; 3) Joomla; and 4) WordPress.

Usually, the teacher organizes the course sequence according to his didactic-pedagogical strategies and expects this help to guide the student through his learning process in the course. However, unless restrictions are imposed, students may choose to follow different paths than those indicated in the material's organization. A question emerges from this context: what are the impacts on the students learning outcomes when they take learning paths other than expected by the teacher? In Virtual Learning Environments, student's interaction with course materials can be stored in the so-called event logs. With the support of Educational Process Mining, it is possible to track the path of how and what specific actions students perform during learning, resulting in process models and historical statistical information. This paper aims to present the application results of PM techniques to verify the students learning paths in an introductory programming course. We used a Moodle event log containing 24605 events collected from 73 undergraduate students. For experiments, we divided this original log file into five other segments of datasets among passed and failed students variations. Techniques to obtain statistical information, Heuristic Miner algorithm to process discovery, and other techniques were applied from the implementations available in ProM Framework and scripts based on PM4Py library. The results showed that overall approved and failed students took different paths and event numbers to perform activities in the course. Besides, we obtained control-flows and frequencies of the activities and connections, thus making it possible to identify the dependencies, which resources started or ended the process, among other things. The analysis of these results provides general and specific information on students' learning paths and can help teachers observe students' behavior patterns and progress.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274125","Process Mining;E-learning;Learning Paths","Electronic learning;Analytical models;Process control;Data models;Programming profession;Performance evaluation;Organizations","","8","","29","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, raising the way of early prediction of potential cheaters through the mouse-tracking technique should be an urgent priority.

The proposed model correctly predicted 94% of students committing illicit actions during the online mid-term examination, which can be possible to early intervene and prevent illegal actions. The study outcome can be used to analyze the learners' mouse tracking behaviors that lead to a better process of secret reconstruction and transparent space.","2470-6698","978-1-7281-6942-2","10.1109/TALE48869.2020.9368400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9368400","academic cheating;prediction;mouse tracking;honest culture;online education","Electric potential;Sensitivity;Visual analytics;Education;Predictive models;Mice;Task analysis","","6","","30","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, most of these studies focus on SRL on Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) environments and only analyse SRL strategies with limited attention to the scaffolds or interventions employed to stimulate growth of SRL skills in learners. The modern Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle allow storage of datasets on student activities. Consequently, it is possible to use Educational Data Mining (EDM) to extract learner patterns which can be used to support SRL and explore how SRL strategies change over time and inform the instructor. In view of this, the research examines the current SRL measurement and promotion tools for e-learning environments and proposes a conceptual model grounded on EDM for implementation as a solution to measuring and promoting SRL strategies for learners within LMS.","2576-8581","978-1-905824-63-2","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2019.8764852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764852","Self-Regulated Learning;Measurement and Promotion;e-learning;Learning Management systems;Scaffolds;Interventions;Online learning","Tools;Electronic learning;Instruments;Data mining;Process control;Learning management systems;Software agents","","6","","64","","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initially, it was proposed to allow people to learn for personal accomplishment without physically attending any traditional university or academic settings. While these systems continue to provide an efficient and flexible approach for teaching and learning, the rapid integration of ICTs and the expansion of data from these systems remain much concern to the education community. In this study, we propose a smart and secure data flow architectural framework for e-learning that uses a rich set of big data tools within a distributed and parallel analysis platform. Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) reference model guided the development of this Big Data framework for e-learning analytics. Using the RM-ODP model as a benchmark, we classify the educational institution's architecture in terms of existing elements, functions and processes to understand stakeholders' views for the development of the framework. Our approach uses an existing distributed computing environment and offers an adaptable standard framework to improve the data acquisition, storage, processing, analysis, security and virtualization for e-learning systems. We implement a scalable and adaptable big data framework for e-learning (BiDeL) and point out how big data concept could integrate into online learning systems to improve teaching and learning in higher education using Apache Spark as a case. The proposed framework was applied to both batch and streaming dataset of students online activities on moodle LMSs. BiDel framework performance shows improved data integration and data governance. This big data framework and the general view of the current state of the art in “big data” technologies will serve as a guide for the creation of e-learning systems, which create new value from existing but underused data. The acquired value will provide decision-makers in higher education with new insights from data to enhance productivity in teaching and learning. These insights can lead to innovation, competitiveness in the academic space and even create entirely new teaching and learning models.","","978-1-7281-6770-1","10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183863","Big Data framework;Online Learning;e-Learning;higher education;RM-ODP","Big Data;Electronic learning;Data models;Analytical models;Standards;Business","","6","","83","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Six students participated in an experiment, whereby they were asked to accomplish ten tasks in the usability testing of a popular open-source LMS called Moodle. The results showed that those who were familiar with the course performed about half of the tasks more efficiently and had better AOI metrics. Additionally, it was found that the participants' eye movement patterns tended to be correlated with their AOI metrics, efficiency and effectiveness of accomplishing the tasks in the usability tests. However, the correlations were not absolute.

They provide data-driven insights on current learning contexts and inform management on any learning intervention strategies that may be needed to support students in achieving their learning outcomes. Besides students, the perspective of instructors too is considered. Using easy-to-read graphical reporting formats (e.g., line graphs, scatter plot, bar charts, etc.), the LAD reveals a consolidated view of how online learning is taking place. In this manner, a snapshot depicting details of student learning patterns can enable instructors to monitor their students' learning strategies. At the same time, the LAD assists students too by providing them with a personalized environment to help them engage better with the learning outcomes. Therefore, LAD is increasingly used as a pedagogical approach to motivate students and help build their self-learning capacity.

However, the class ratio within software vulnerability datasets is often highly imbalanced (since the percentage of observed vulnerability is usually very low). Goal: To help security practitioners address software security data class imbalanced issues and further help build better prediction models with resampled datasets. Method: We introduce an approach called Dazzle which is an optimized version of conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP). Dazzle explores the architecture hyperparameters of cWGAN-GP with a novel optimizer called Bayesian Optimization. We use Dazzle to generate minority class samples to resample the original imbalanced training dataset. Results: We evaluate Dazzle with three software security datasets, i.e., Moodle vulnerable files, Ambari bug reports, and JavaScript function code. We show that Dazzle is practical to use and demonstrates promising improvement over existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques such as SMOTE (e.g., with an average of about 60% improvement rate over SMOTE in recall among all datasets). Conclusion: Based on this study, we would suggest the use of optimized GANs as an alternative method for security vulnerability data class imbalanced issues.","2574-3864","978-1-4503-9303-4","10.1145/3524842.3528437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796337","Security Vulnerability Prediction;Class Imbalance;Hyperparameter Optimization;Generative Adversarial Networks","Training;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Generative adversarial networks;Software;Data models;Security","","3","","69","","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fully online learning often suffers from a lack of student engagement. It is therefore important for us to explore ways to alleviate student disengagement in online learning. In this study, we report the use of the goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration-fantasy (GAFCC-F) design model in online gamified classes. This mixed-method study examines the effects of exogenous and endogenous fantasies on student intrinsic motivation and course engagement. Study 1 was an exogenous fantasy embedded gamified online class where the plots and story have no association with the learning tasks on Moodle. Study 2 was an endogenous fantasy context where the plots could reflect the content of learning tasks.

Learning style is one of the most important factors in the E-learning environment because it can help the system to effectively personalize the learning process of students according to their learning style. Previously, to detect student learning styles by asking students to fill out questionnaires. However, there are problems with this static technique. One of these problems is the lack of students' self-awareness of their learning preferences. In addition, almost all students feel bored when asked to fill out a questionnaire. This research determined the learning style based on the Felder and Silverman Learning Style. This determination process is carried out using student activity data on a pure Moodle learning management system (LMS). The process begins with processing based on the literature to get a vector combination of learning styles. Student activity data is processed to produce data that only contains activities that are included in the selected features. The results of both are combined as input to the clustering process. This research applies the modified K-Means Clustering algorithm. Modifications were made using the learning style combination vector as the initial centroid. The k value used in this study was 8 which came from 8 combinations of learning styles from 3 dimensions used in this study. This is different from the combination of learning styles in FSLSM which has 16 combinations of learning styles originating from 4 dimensions of learning styles. This difference is caused by student activity data that only supports 3 dimensions of learning style.","","978-1-6654-2155-3","10.1109/ICIC54025.2021.9633010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9633010","felder and silverman;learning style;literature based;k-means;clustering","Training;Learning management systems;Electronic learning;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning;Data processing;Data models","","3","","15","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a scoring algorithm to calculate the percentage of each student's attentiveness in the specific class, this system aims to increase the use of artificial intelligence approaches. The graph provided by this tool may be used to measure how well a student understands the material being taught. Data mining tools are increasingly being used in higher education to help students and administrators better understand and resolve educational and administrative difficulties. The majority of educational mining research focuses on replicating students' performance rather than instructors' performance. The course assessment questionnaire is a standard instrument for evaluating teachers' performance based on students' perceptions. There are a number of different ways for creating classification techniques in this system, from decision trees to support vector machines to machine learning techniques, including differential evolution. Comparing their answers to an actual course assessment question based on its accuracy, retention and sensitivity. Students' online conduct has become more accessible because to the use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions. These statistics have been utilized by several studies to predict student outcomes. A wide range of subjects and predictive characteristics collected from the LMS make it difficult to draw generalized statements about the processes that control student performance. To get started let's take a look at some of the most recent research' theoretical foundations and common predictions in the field of learning analytics. A total of 4,989 students took 17 blended courses with Moodle LMS at the same school, and both multi-level and conventional regressions are utilized to examine the impact of LMS predictor factors and between-course evaluation grades on student performance. Despite the fact that they were gathered inside a single institution, our studies demonstrate that the outcomes of predictive modelling varied greatly between courses. As a result, the predictive models' range of motion is constrained. The data from LMS also shows that early intervention and intermediate assessment grades have little (if any) relevance from LMS data.","","978-1-6654-7971-4","10.1109/ICESC54411.2022.9885462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885462","Learning Management Systems;LMS;Learning Analytics;Portability;Student Performance;Predictive Modeling","Support vector machines;Learning management systems;Analytical models;Sensitivity;Process control;Learning (artificial intelligence);Predictive models","","1","","21","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are some visual programming software available, such as iVProg. iVProg is free and open source tool, designed to help the teaching and learning of algorithms, especially in introductory programming courses. The current version is developed with HTML5 technologies, fully portable, with a lot of resources specially the automatic evaluation and its integration into Moodle. This paper presents a comparative study between two different user interface implementations for iVProg: context menu against fixed menu. Each interface have different ways to delivery the resources to users. Moreover, both of them use point-and-click mouse interaction in order to allow the user to develop algorithms. Usability tests were performed with undergraduate students to identify users' awareness concerning their effort and performance while interacting with the system. Students enrolled in a summer introductory programming course were invited to participate of usability tests. The attendees were divided in two groups, one group started using the fixed menu and the other with context menu. In the second session, the groups inverted the utilized interface. The study analyzed different instruments: the mouse log, NASA-TLX workload perception data, also an unstructured interview, that was conducted in order to identify students' perception about their experience with iVProg. When analyzed visually, logs of mouse clicks obtained in the introductory programming course showed that the construction of algebraic and logical expressions required a higher number of interactions in both interface versions. Although students found the fixed menu interface less mental demanding, the overall workload of the fixed menu interface was much higher when compared to the context menu. Moreover, the participants of the introductory programming course obtained better results, with grades higher than class average.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028616","iVProg;NASA-TLX;Visual Programming Language;Programming teaching;Workload;Usability","Visualization;Task analysis;Usability;Tools;Education;Programming profession","","1","","18","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Google Classroom, Google Meet, Moodle among others creates a digital divide between students who are techsavvy and those who are technophobic. Furthermore, it appears that online learning is exclusive to some students and tends to view all students as the same. This is problematic, given that some students face diverse challenges ranging from limited or compromised access to internet networks and affordability of Information Communication Technology (ICT) gadgets for participating in online classes. This study provides a detailed contemporary view of the practices associated with electronic learning and the challenges faced by students during online classes. Study findings revealed some proactive measures taken by the university authorities and teaching staff to promote inclusive education and assessment.

In this approach, students do not learn to use standard professional tools to work on a source code, and the teachers also spend much time grading. There is an opportunity to use source control management (SCM), such as Git via GitHub or GitLab, as a submission method for students. This mechanism helps programming students practice a common process used in the professional world as early as possible. Rather than manual grading, autograders are widely used in Learning Management Systems to help instructors grade student works. Autograders work faster than humans and provide objective grading. This paper discusses an integration model for learning management systems, source control management, and autograders, each of these components is usually used separately. We write a reference implementation that uses Moodle as the LMS and GitLab as the SCM. We also build a minimally functional autograder in place for proof-of-concept in this implementation. Students can submit their work using the merge request feature provided by GitLab from the repository that they fork from the instructor’s original repository. The system captures the merge request event, and the autograder starts grading student works and updates student scores in the LMS. We also discuss how the system performs when dealing with many requests semi-simultaneously to simulate an exam situation. The system follows the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principle to keep each component agnostic, and developers can use any LMS, SCM, and autograder they find suitable. In our experiment, the system can handle 200 submissions in a short period amount of time. The results are that the student learns SCM basic workflow using the system, and the teachers are helped by automated grading.","2640-0227","978-1-6654-9453-3","10.1109/ICoDSE53690.2021.9648450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9648450","integration;learning management system;autograder;webhook;source control management","Bridges;Learning management systems;Codes;Control systems;Throughput;Service-oriented architecture;Task analysis","","","","7","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through the literature review, we developed three separate impact models i.e. mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology with separate impact factors. We used pre and post usage survey questionnaires of 60 teachers and 60 learners to evaluate these models. Primarily, they were asked to fill the pre-usage questionnaire with their initial mobile learning experience. Then, they were allowed to use the modified Moodle mobile app and asked to fill the post-usage questionnaire. The results reveal that the most significant influencing factors are, ease of use in mobile learning content, and facilitating conditions for higher education institutes and communication technology models.

Recent studies indicate that 21st century students can master different skills and competencies to achieve success in their education, among which we highlight collaborative learning and educational robotics. One of the resources which successfully employ collaborative activities is groupware, which is a virtual collaborative system that supports groups of people with common tasks or objectives and enables the management of group activities. Many research works show that educational robotics has become an important facilitating and motivating tool for students entering Computer-focused courses. Literature has shown that both tools are important for the application of a STEM approach and have led to good results in an educational environment. To analyse the learning perceptions of educational robotics in a collaborative environment, we have developed a pedagogical approach that relies on collaborative learning through a groupware called IGARA, developed on Moodle platform. Activities made available by the virtual environment were developed based on constructivist, interactionist principles, with task contextualization to enhance students' perception. In order to assess the functionality of such an approach, an exploratory study was carried out with a set of 14 students, divided into 3 groups, spatially distant due to Covid-19 pandemic safety measures.

This paper defines genders for disciplines through historical biases and perceptions - e.g., birth, religion, language, region, brought up, to say a few; these were obtained thru' several focus-group discussions. However, technologies, such as computers, the World Wide Web (WWW), Moodle, sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT), Virtualization and Immersion technologies are constantly changing the nature of education and learning. As a consequence, and through a series of arguments, we establish that the genders of many popular disciplines are becoming feminine in nature. We also define two terms, namely, Gender Capital and Gender Capitalization, through which respectively one could possibly define and analyze ways and means by which the changing nature of genders of disciplines can be profitably exploited for the global goodness.","","978-1-7281-5286-8","10.1109/ICoAC48765.2019.247123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9087324","Information and Other Technology Impacts;Changing nature of Education;Raising Feminity in Education & Learning;Disciplinary Genders;Gender Capital and Gender Capitalization;Information and Other Technology Impacts, Changing nature of Education, Raising Feminity in Education;Learning, Disciplinary Genders, Gender Capital and Gender Capitalization","","","","","15","IEEE","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of learning is usually supported by Web-based learning systems such as Massive Open Online Courses (Coursera, edX, etc.) and Learning Management Systems (Moodle, Blackboard-Learn, etc.). However, in this remote context, students often lack feedback and support from educational staff, especially when they face difficulties or challenges. For that reason, this work presents a Prediction-Intervention approach that (a) predicts students who present difficulties during an online learning course, based on two main learning indicators, namely engagement and performance rates, and (b) offers immediate support to students, tailored to the problem they are facing. To predict students’ issues, our approach considers ten machine learning algorithms of different types (standalone, ensemble, and deep learning) which are compared to determine the best performing ones. It has been experimented with a dataset collected from the Blackboard-Learn platform utilized in an engineering school called ESIEE-IT in France during 2021-2022 academic year, showing thus quite promising results.","","978-1-6654-9402-1","10.1109/WI-IAT55865.2022.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101952","Machine Learning;Learning Analytics;Web-based Learning;Students’ difficulties Prediction;Assistance","Deep learning;COVID-19;Learning management systems;Machine learning algorithms;Electronic learning;Pandemics;Education","","","","27","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But laboratory equipment can be expensive and students cannot take it with them to use it everywhere and at any time like a laptop computer or tablet. MoMoViLab provides a cloud solution for this issue by transferring experiments from the laboratory into a web browser. It follows the three principles of easy usability, modularity and scalability. MoMoViLab is designed to collaborate with common learning platforms like Moodle [1] or ILIAS [2]. The user interface only provides the functionality which is needed to carry out a specific experiment. Simulations are server-based, therefore no software has to be installed on students’ devices and performance requirements are kept low. New graphical display elements, editors and simulation software can easily be included into the system. Due to its modularity, multiple instances of simulation servers can run on different (virtual) machines in a cloud infrastructure to be able to handle highly changing demands. MoMoViLab can start or shut down virtual machines automatically, depending on the current or estimated future workload.","","978-1-5386-9114-4","10.1109/EWME.2018.8629489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629489","","Cloud computing;Integrated circuit modeling;Web servers;Linear systems;Browsers;Virtual machining","","","","14","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter therefore continue to follow their courses thanks in particular to the distance learning system commissioned by the Ministry of Education. Morocco can thus rely on a second mean of education and teaching even after the end of the pandemic for the many advantages it has. At present, each Moroccan university has its own platform; it is obvious that students, today, have their own institutional account that allows them to access these platforms, a crossroads for information exchange and document sharing. Students are relatively initiated to this kind of platform such as Moodle or Google Classroom. However, this is not enough. Morocco needs a complete virtual university capable of providing a good quality of education to all those who deserve and demand it. This paper aims to explain the different categories of learners according to learning models, and to make a comparison between the existing virtual universities in order to make our vision of the Moroccan virtual university more concrete by proposing a model for the latter in a forthcoming work.","","978-1-7281-6921-7","10.1109/ICECOCS50124.2020.9314544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314544","virtual university;learning;distance learning;learning models","Tools;Education;Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Faces;Visualization;Statistics","","","","15","IEEE","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ILE must afford tools to replace traditional means and the analysis of the learner's interactions with his interactive learning environment must fill this gap through the digital traces. Thereby, we propose in this article an approach of identification, analysis and interpretation of the traces allowing all the actors of the ILE (the learner included) to improve the experience of the learner, throughout its learning cycle. This approach is based on the modelization of the learner profile through the implementation of attributes and indicators at all levels of interactions, as well as iterative algorithms of unsupervised classification (clustering). In addition, it is based on the adaptation of the path according to the cluster of each learner based on association algorithms and a recommendation system.
