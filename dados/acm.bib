abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to a new paradigm known as the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AIoT research. We examine AIoT literature related to sensing, computing, and networking &amp; communication, which form the three key components of AIoT. In addition to advancements in these areas, we review domain-specific AIoT systems that are designed for various important application domains. We have also created an accompanying GitHub repository, where we compile the papers included in this survey: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/AIoT-Survey. This repository will be actively maintained and updated with new research as it becomes available. As both IoT and AI become increasingly critical to our society, we believe that AIoT is emerging as an essential research field at the intersection of IoT and modern AI. It is our hope that this survey will serve as a valuable resource for those engaged in AIoT research and act as a catalyst for future explorations to bridge gaps and drive advancements in this exciting field.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a profound impact in almost every domain. A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of data-centric AI. The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems. A companion list of data-centric AI resources will be regularly updated on .},

abstract = {The continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) theory has propelled this field to unprecedented heights, owing to the relentless efforts of scholars and researchers. In the medical realm, AI takes a pivotal role, leveraging robust machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI technology in medical imaging aids physicians in X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses, conducts pattern recognition and disease prediction based on acoustic data, delivers prognoses on disease types and developmental trends for patients, and employs intelligent health management wearable devices with human-computer interaction technology to name but a few. While these well-established applications have significantly assisted in medical field diagnoses, clinical decision-making, and management, collaboration between the medical and AI sectors faces an urgent challenge: How to substantiate the reliability of decision-making? The underlying issue stems from the conflict between the demand for accountability and result transparency in medical scenarios and the black-box model traits of AI. This article reviews recent research grounded in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on medical practices within the visual, audio, and multimodal perspectives. We endeavor to categorize and synthesize these practices, aiming to provide support and guidance for future researchers and healthcare professionals.},

In this paper, I argue ChatGPT and similar chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be best understood as animated characters. More than just cartooning, puppetry, or CGI, animation is a paradigm involving the projection of qualities perceived as human such as power, agency, will, and personality outside of the self and onto objects in the environment. Characteristics of animation—including reliance on stereotypes, obfuscation of human labor, and manipulation of an audience's emotions—can help us both analyze and respond appropriately to interactive AI technologies and the hyperbolic claims of their promoters.},

abstract = {With the development of the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education, countries and international organizations have introduced relevant policies to address the opportunities and challenges it brings to education. A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a "policy tool—policy content" two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers' and students' intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age.},

abstract = {A fiduciary is a trusted agent that has the legal duty to act with loyalty and care towards a principal that employs them. When fiduciary organizations interact with users through a digital interface, or otherwise automate their operations with artificial intelligence, they will need to design these AI systems to be compliant with their duties. This article synthesizes recent work in computer science and law to develop a procedure for designing and auditing Fiduciary AI. The designer of a Fiduciary AI should understand the context of the system, identify its principals, and assess the best interests of those principals. Then the designer must be loyal with respect to those interests, and careful in an contextually appropriate way. We connect the steps in this procedure to dimensions of Trustworthy AI, such as privacy and alignment. Fiduciary AI is a promising means to address the incompleteness of data subject’s consent when interacting with complex technical systems.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development and the various applications of artificial intelligence technology has been gradually replacing many labor-intensive and creative tasks. Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

abstract = {Public service provision in the frontline, coined street-level bureaucracy, has been gradually impacted by information and communications technology (ICT) for decades. This impact, however, has mostly considered ICT as a tool suitable for tasks with low complexity. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), there are examples of AI use for more complex street-level work. Examples include cases where AI is used for assessing eligibility for social benefits, predictive policing models, automated grading, and diagnostics in healthcare. While these applications demonstrate potential benefits, they also introduce new challenges related to privacy, accountability, corporatization and alienation of street-level work, and client service experiences. This article is a critical reflection on the street-level potential of AI in providing public services. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on AI's impact in street-level work by emphasizing both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI integration in frontline service provision. While AI may mitigate some limitations of human decision-making (e.g., subjectivity, inconsistency, and bias), it can also introduce challenges that require careful consideration (e.g., lack of transparency, data-driven bias, and limited contextual adaptation). By critically reflecting on AI's street-level potential, this article calls for a balanced approach to AI adoption in street-level work.},

While many learning systems already address this issue, they typically lack automation and scalability in teaching novices and, thus, hinder the learning processes within organizations. Recent research emphasizes the capability of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to make black-box artificial intelligence systems interpretable for decision-makers. This work explores the potential of using (X)AI-based learning systems for providing learning examples and explanations to novices. In an exploratory study, we evaluate novices’ learning performance in a learning setting taking into account their cognitive abilities. Our results show that novices increase their learning performance throughout the exploratory study. These results shed light on how XAI can facilitate learning, taking first steps towards understanding the potential of XAI in learning systems.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence, represented by Chatgpt, has been developing rapidly because of its superiority in form and process, covering almost all industries. In order to comply with the development of technology, some classroom teaching also incorporates it to build a generative artificial intelligence classroom. The classroom interaction behavior has an important reference value to help teachers reconstruct the teaching design and reform the teaching mode. The purpose of this paper is to derive significant behavioral sequence characteristics by coding and recording the actual video of generative artificial intelligence classrooms and analyzing the classroom interaction behaviors using lag sequence analysis. The study shows that the teacher-student interaction in the generative artificial intelligence classroom is more active, and the students' active participation in the classroom is very high, which will further promote the generative artificial intelligence classroom and realize the deep integration of the new technology and the classroom.},

abstract = {In urban search and rescue (USAR) operations, communication between handlers and specially trained canines is crucial but often complicated by challenging environments and the specific behaviors canines are trained to exhibit when detecting a person. Since a USAR canine often works out of sight of the handler, the handler lacks awareness of the canine’s location and situation, known as the “sensemaking gap.” In this paper, we propose KHAIT, a novel approach to close the sensemaking gap and enhance USAR effectiveness by integrating object detection-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Equipped with AI-powered cameras, edge computing, and AR headsets, KHAIT enables precise and rapid object detection from a canine’s perspective, improving survivor localization. We evaluate this approach in a real-world USAR environment, demonstrating an average survival allocation time decrease of 22%, enhancing the speed and accuracy of operations.},

Through examination of existing ethical frameworks, legislation, principles, and guidelines, this paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level ethical guidelines and their practical application in AI development workflows. The framework emphasises transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement, and aligns with consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics perspectives.

It is born to solve the problems faced by the previous generation of the Internet such as imbalanced distribution of interests, monopoly of platform resources, and leakage of personal privacy. In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.},

abstract = {Trustworthy artificial intelligence (Trusted AI) is of utmost importance when learning-enabled components (LECs) are used in autonomous, safety-critical systems. When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the development of science and technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education begin to increase. Many well-known universities in China have stepped up their pace and actively explored the deep integration of "artificial intelligence + education". A series of innovative practices, such as intelligent teaching system, intelligent classroom, virtual teaching assistant and personalized learning platform, all show that the education industry is undergoing an unprecedented intelligent transformation. But at the same time, the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching process in colleges and universities is not mature, and there are still many problems. In this context, it has become very urgent to explore how to efficiently use artificial intelligence technology to contribute to the higher education in China. This paper introduces the development process of AI and its application in colleges and universities, then analyzes the obstacles of AI when applied in higher education, and finally proposes specific application strategies for artificial intelligence to empower new teaching and learning models in universities. It is hoped that the research of this paper can improve the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching of universities in China.},

We assessed the ability of GAI, specifically the GPT class of models, at automatically coding discourse in the context of a learning analytics study using a variety of prompting and training strategies.

abstract = {Given the increasing population of English learners, a number of well-optimized learning approaches greatly improve learners’ overall academic performance. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has contributed to the rapid development of education, and it has also had a beneficial impact on English learning. To examine the favourable effect in the process of learning English at university, we have extensively incorporated AI technology, including building and optimizing learning paths with the help of AI performance evaluation approaches, optimising the organisation and use of learning resources with utilization of AI search, file linking, and file management tools, etc., and gained some practical experience, which is summarised as “personalised learning methodologies for university English with the application of Artificial Intelligence”, which is abbreviated as “PLM-UE-A+AI”, and further shortened as “PAI”. In demonstrating our work, we firstly analyse the characteristics and difficulties of university English learning, and identify its main difficulties as: the improvement of learning objectives, the extension of learning contents, the flexibility and diversity of learning methods and approaches, the limitation of learning time and academic pressure, and the difficulties brought by the introduction of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence. Then, we present the scientific meaning of PAI, and its scientific content, which includes learning resource construction, learning path planning, learning support services, learning analysis and evaluation, as well as feedback and re-optimisation of learning strategies. Furthermore, we provide a specific implementation plan and specific implementation solutions for the practical application of PAI, by defining and establishing learning objectives, constructing and optimising learning paths, organising learning resources and learning modes, scientific performance evaluation and feedback, and continuously introducing new learning methods. Our practice shows that PAI helps to improve the mastery of grammar and vocabulary and communication endowment, which effectively reduces resistance to learning, strengthens the standardised use of learning resources, and enhances the learning effect.},

abstract = {With the development of the theory and technology of computer science, machine or computer painting is increasingly being explored in the creation of art. Machine-made works are referred to as artificial intelligence (AI) artworks. Early methods of AI artwork generation have been classified as non-photorealistic rendering, and, latterly, neural style transfer methods have also been investigated. As technology advances, the variety of machine-generated artworks and the methods used to create them have proliferated. However, there is no unified and comprehensive system to classify and evaluate these works. To date, no work has generalized methods of creating AI artwork including learning-based methods for painting or drawing. Moreover, the taxonomy, evaluation, and development of AI artwork methods face many challenges. This article is motivated by these considerations. We first investigate current learning-based methods for making AI artworks and classify the methods according to art styles. Furthermore, we propose a consistent evaluation system for AI artworks and conduct a user study to evaluate the proposed system on different AI artworks. This evaluation system uses six criteria: beauty, color, texture, content detail, line, and style. The user study demonstrates that the six-dimensional evaluation index is effective for different types of AI artworks.},

abstract = {The design of English teaching system based on artificial intelligence technology aims to solve the problems of insufficient training time and low efficiency in traditional English teaching. The research adopts advanced technologies such as intelligent speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning to build an efficient and interactive learning environment. By integrating virtual reality and augmented reality technology, the system strengthens students' language application ability and encourages communication in simulated or actual contexts. The classroom teaching mode covers three stages: before class, during class and after class, to ensure the comprehensive improvement of students' listening and speaking skills. ITS module design includes student model, teacher model and expert model, which realizes the adjustment of personalized teaching content, evaluates learning results and provides targeted solutions. The realization of system functions depends on three core components: remote courseware service system, customer mobile learning system and data agent system, providing a stable and efficient personalized adaptive learning experience. The test results show that the system can still maintain high efficiency and stability when the number of concurrent users increases, which is superior to the traditional teaching system. In addition, intelligent composition correction, oral practice feedback, personalized learning plan recommendation and intelligent translation tools have significantly improved students' English writing ability and oral fluency.},

abstract = {In terms of business decision-making, there are still issues to be resolved regarding the intelligence of key performance indicators. To address this technical problem, from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, modeling methods such as support vector machines, random search, and machine learning for key performance indicators (KPI) in business decision-making systems have been proposed. The system integrates with large language models, driving the generative efficiency and accuracy of KPI data cleaning, feature extraction, and model optimization training. Using MATLAB to conduct predictive simulation experiments on the integrated system, compared to general information systems for KPIs that do not utilize large language models or Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, the volume of reference data for business decision-making based on large language models increased by 93.61 times, and decision-making efficiency improved by 36.59%, indicating that the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content modeling scheme for business decision-making systems based on operational KPIs is feasible.},

abstract = {The effective and efficient use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is fast becoming a skill that makes students competitive in the job market and beyond. However, successfully incorporating AI in the classroom presents unique challenges that requires instructors and students to adopt, ethically use, and evaluate AI-infused pedagogy. Research literature points to the positive role of AI tools in improved appropriability and evocativeness, which lead to better learning outcomes through greater personalization of information gathering and better personal reflection processes. AI-driven chatbots could support learning styles of diverse students and provide an opportunity for slow learners to perform well, in contrast to a traditional classroom where all students may be required to keep pace with instructor's delivery. AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) can assist both students and instructors. Step-by-step feedback and suggestions for improvement could help the student's learning in an interactive manner. Instructors could also use AI supported ITS for simplifying and automating grading, thereby providing quicker and more meaningful feedback to students regardless of class size. Notwithstanding the benefits, it is noteworthy to highlight AI's downsides in the classroom. It is plausible that the availability of AI tools causes complacency in students who may skip in-person lectures and rely on remote learning using AI alone. AI based tools could be misused by students for completing assignments, leading to questions concerning academic ethics and fairness. Universities and instructors should reflect on how to modify assessments to objectively measure and quantify performance outcomes in an AI world.},

abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot, is transforming educational methodologies, including undergraduate physics courses for engineering students. Despite their potential, these LLMs typically rely on statistical learning methods and often exhibit algebraic inaccuracies in solving standard university-level physics problems. This study explores the use of LLMs in physics courses for N = 91 freshman engineering students over two academic terms (Spring and Fall 2023). Students engaged in AI-assisted activities to solve physics problems and were asked to identify and correct the errors made by the chatbot. The outcomes were compared with those from traditional teaching methods without AI involvement, and no significant difference in student learning gains was found. To assess the impact of AI tools in education, a more detailed approach using pre-test and post-test instruments&nbsp;with control and experimental groups is necessary. Survey results revealed, however, that AI-assisted sessions enhanced student engagement, problem-solving skills, and understanding of physics concepts. Students also indicated a strong preference for AI-assisted activities, citing increased motivation and a firm belief in the educational benefits of using these tools. Our findings suggest that well-designed AI interventions can effectively complement traditional instructional methods, especially when the LLMs are integrated with symbolic computational tools like WolframAlpha to improve their accuracy.},

To achieve our purpose, we utilize Bayesian deep learning and uncertainty-aware planning, which allow us to create visual indicators to demonstrate how autonomous agents perceive their surroundings and take action. We use a reinforcement learning method called DQN with uncertainty and compare the results with four other baseline algorithms: DQN, DDQN with Prioritised Replay, Dueling DDQN and DDQN. Our findings show that the uncertainty estimate can generate a more efficient and stable decision-making model. To explain the behaviour of our agent, we suggest an interface that displays the current view of the environment, the agent's view, Q-values for each possible action, state value, a heatmap relative to the agent's input, and a visual representation of the uncertainty connected with each Q-value. Our approach can enhance the human understanding of the algorithm's decision-making process and confidence in its performance.},

However, nowadays, the development of AI is unpredictable with the stated values of those developing them; hence, the risk of misbehaving AI increases continuously. Therefore, there are uncertainties about endorsing that the development and deploying of AI are favorable and not unfavorable to humankind. In addition, AI holds a black-box pattern, which results in a lack of understanding of how systems can work based on the raised concerns. From the above discussion, trustworthy AI is vital for the extensive adoption of AI in many applications, with strong attention to humankind and the need to focus on AI systems developing into the system outline at the time of system design. In this survey, we discuss compound materials on trustworthy AI and the present state-of-the-art of trustworthy AI technologies, revealing new perspectives, bridging knowledge gaps, and paving the way for potential advances of robustness, and explainability rules which play a proactive role in designing AI systems. Systems that are reliable and secure and mimic human behavior significantly impact the technological AI ecosystem. We provide various contemporary technologies to build explainability and robustness for AI-based solutions, so AI works in a safer and more trustworthy manner. Finally, we conclude our survey article with high-end opportunities, challenges, and future research directions for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.},

We demonstrate that our workflow can be seamlessly integrated and orchestrated across research facilities managed by different federal agencies, thus allowing users to extract new scientific insights from climate datasets. The experimental results indicate that the multi-facility workflow significantly reduces processing time, enhances scalability, and maintains high efficiency across varying workloads. Notably, our workflow processes 12,000 high-resolution satellite images in just 44 seconds using 80 workers distributed across 10 nodes on the OLCF systems.

abstract = {Data preparation -- the process of discovering, integrating, transforming, cleaning, and annotating data -- is one of the oldest, hardest, yet inevitable data management problems. Unfortunately, data preparation is known to be iterative, requires high human cost, and is error-prone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown very promising results on many data preparation tasks. At a high level, AI for data preparation (AI4DP) should have the following abilities. First, the AI model should capture real-world knowledge so as to solve various tasks. Second, it is important to easily adapt to new datasets/tasks. Third, data preparation is a complicated pipeline with many operations, which results in a large number of candidates to select the optimum, and thus it is crucial to effectively and efficiently explore the large space of possible pipelines.In this tutorial, we will cover three important topics to address the above issues: demystifying foundation models to inject knowledge for data preparation, tuning and adapting pre-trained language models for data preparation, and orchestrating data preparation pipelines for different downstream applications.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a prominent technology in the development of smart cities. However, adopting AI in smart cities is very complicated because of its multi-dimensional nature, various application fields, and also the ecosystem-like environment with many stakeholders. This study discusses seven strategic factors, including policy guarantee, stakeholder collaboration, financial capability, and public demands, information security, data availability, and AI infrastructure, and identifies their configurations which lead to a high smart city performance via the adoption of AI. A theoretical model is developed to understand smart city practice in 31 capital cities in the mainland of China. The findings reveal the complexity of AI adoption in smart cities from a configurational perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in isolation, but in combination with others to promote AI adoption in smart cities. Understanding the configurational relationships of these factors can help smart city strategists in their planning and policymaking relating to the development of smart cities.},

abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has brought many conveniences to people, and at the same time has had a huge impact on the traditional education model. Interactive learning platforms have become mainstream in the context of the big data era. This article takes an online course in a university as an example to explore user interest points, demand characteristics and knowledge acquisition rules in an artificial intelligence system environment. After processing and analyzing students' browsing behavior in different scenarios, the corresponding results are returned to the database to better grasp the user's preference information and provide more services for teaching. At the same time, through the application of machine intelligence algorithms and AI technology, the personalized recommendation capabilities of the learning platform can be improved to meet students' personalized learning needs. This article tests the algorithm of the system. The test results show that the content-based recommendation algorithm performs medium to high in accuracy, but its coverage is low and is not affected by data sparsity. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm performs generally highest in terms of accuracy and coverage, with an accuracy rate of 96%, and is sensitive to sparse data. The hybrid recommendation algorithm has high accuracy and coverage, and factors such as data sparsity have a medium to high impact on it. Recommendation algorithms based on deep learning show high levels of accuracy and coverage, and their impact on factors such as data sparsity is also moderate to high. However, although artificial intelligence technology has broad prospects for application in the field of education, it also faces some challenges, such as privacy protection and compliance with data use. Therefore, in the process of promoting and applying artificial intelligence technology, it is necessary to strengthen compliance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that students' information security and privacy rights are effectively protected.},

abstract = {Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.},

We systematically survey state-of-the-art methods across five critical aspects of building an accurate and robust AI-powered malware-detection model: malware sophistication, analysis techniques, malware repositories, feature selection, and machine learning vs. deep learning. The effectiveness of an AI model is dependent on the quality of the features it is trained with. In turn, the quality and authenticity of these features is dependent on the quality of the dataset and the suitability of the analysis tool. Static analysis is fast but is limited by the widespread use of obfuscation. Dynamic analysis is not impacted by obfuscation but is defeated by ubiquitous anti-analysis techniques and requires more computational power. Sophisticated and evasive malware is challenging to extract authentic discriminatory features from and, combined with poor quality datasets, this can lead to a situation where a model achieves high accuracy with only one specific dataset.},

Recommender systems, as an important application of artificial intelligence, can effectively filter learning resources and automatically recommend personalized learning resources to learners based on their learning characteristics, preferences and needs. Based on the knowledge representation and collaborative filtering algorithm, this work integrates the learner's educational proficiency and learning style and other characteristics into the recommendation process to carry out personalized intelligent recommendation, proposes a personalized learning resources intelligent recommendation algorithm, and constructs a knowledge representation model of learners and learning resources; experiments show that the intelligent recommendation algorithm with the combination of knowledge representation-collaborative filtering is better than the traditional CF algorithm in terms of the recommendation of personalized resources and the accuracy of learning resources. better than the traditional CF algorithm.},

abstract = {Computer science curricula have started to include competencies related to artificial intelligence (AI) in K–12 education. However, before introducing a new topic into the classroom and suggesting competencies, it is essential to identify the central practices of the discipline. In the following research, we focus on identifying practices related to data, as current school curricula significantly underestimate the role of data, and understanding how data is processed is a key to understanding how AI systems function. We examine the theoretical literature on practices applied to data when creating AI systems, map the practices in a process model, validate the results of the mapping with domain experts, and contrast the results with current AI curricula for school students. The contribution of this work is a process model that summarizes data-related practices for AI systems built with machine learning, is comprehensively domain-embedded, and is aligned with K–12 education. Computer science educators can use it as a blueprint for defining competencies and designing learning arrangements that aim to enable students to create and understand AI systems.},

abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

abstract = {In order to explore the design application of context-awareness in the scenic mobility scooter under the background of artificial intelligence. Firstly, the concepts of artificial intelligence, context-awareness and scenic mobility scooter are introduced, and the current status of theoretical research and existing problems of scenic mobility scooter are sorted out. Secondly, combining the advantages and characteristics of context-aware intervention in the scenic scooter, the context information related to the scenic scooter under the view of artificial intelligence is divided into four categories: user, environment, task, and equipment, and at the same time, different stages of the use of the context information hierarchy is categorized and corresponds to the pain point needs, and the corresponding artificial intelligence access points are analyzed. Finally, four design strategies are proposed based on the above four contextual factors. It is concluded that the application of context-awareness theory to the design of scenic mobility scooters under the perspective of artificial intelligence strengthens the ability to perceive multidimensional contextual information, explores the user's needs in dynamic situations from a multidimensional perspective, simplifies the user's operation path, and enhances the user's touring experience.},

abstract = {The sports domain contains significant computational impediments to artificial intelligence and analysis capability. In this study, I investigate performance analysis methodologies that have been applied to team sports challenges thus far. Sports and injury prediction, player investment, match outcome prediction, and limits are among our specialties. By evaluating research in these disciplines, we study how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to anticipate matches and assist sports teams in making better tactical and strategic decisions. These minor details might sometimes escape human notice. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders, who developed a computer algorithm recently that can assess any discomfort associated with sports. These little things can occasionally elude human vision. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play. However, the full scope of AI remains unknown. The limitations of AI must also be understood by the game's stakeholders. This work is based on an exploratory investigation of AI applications in team games. The project's purpose is to look at the existing and potential applications of AI in team sports performance monitoring. The study also looked at the constraints of employing AI. In this case, artificial intelligence (AI) enters the picture. However, the scope of AI is still uncertain. The game's stakeholders must also be aware of AI's limits. Overall, this study revealed that using AI and other technologies to improve team competitiveness, decision-making, and customer experience can help teams achieve goals and open up new options. According to this study, team sports such as basketball and football have profited immensely from artificial intelligence (AI), but AI's full potential has yet to be achieved.},

abstract = {With the support and promotion of big data and cloud computing, AI has penetrated into every field of people's lives more and more deeply, with its characteristics of sustainable work, extremely fast computing speed, and a certain intelligence. This is an effective way to solve the general lack of demand and productivity of visual design, and relieve the pressure off designers to deal with relatively low-quality and high-demand designs. Therefore, the combination of design and artificial intelligence technology is a necessity. Research on the application of artificial intelligence technology for visual design is also in full swing at home and abroad However, at present, teams at home and abroad are in the exploratory stage. This paper considers whether it is possible to build an intelligent visual design and creation system by using artificial intelligence technology to help graphic communication designers achieve high-quality, high-efficiency, and high-quantity design output. Additionally, this paperexplores how to combine artificial intelligence technology with designers' design workflow so as to form a complementary human-computer cooperation mode. We will explore how to integrate AI technology with designers' design workflow and then create a human-machine collaboration model with complementary advantages to achieve the high quality, high efficiency, and high quantity of design output required by the intelligent visual design creation system being built. Finally, a basic framework of a generative smart human-computer collaborative visual design creation system based on a subset of neural network expert systems in multiple domains and an aggregate of different modules supported by the system is formed, and the working principle and usage process of the system are further elaborated with the example of packaging design.},

As AI technologies increasingly influence learning environments, they offer novel opportunities for personalized learning, efficient assessment, and data-driven decision-making. However, these advancements also raise critical ethical questions regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, student autonomy, and the changing roles of educators. This research examines specific use cases of AI in education, analyzing both their potential benefits and drawbacks. By revisiting the philosophical principles of ancient Greek thinkers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, we discuss how their writings can guide the ethical implementation of AI in modern education. The paper argues that while AI presents significant challenges, a balanced approach informed by classical philosophical thought can lead to an ethically sound transformation of education. It emphasizes the evolving role of teachers as facilitators and the importance of fostering student initiative in AI-rich environments.},

During the sessions, children experimented with creative and hands-on Machine Learning activities, encouraging reflection around AI and the role of technology in everyday life. Children were asked about their views of AI first, and after that the concept was explained to them. Findings of the study suggest that some children's opinion about AI was changed after they were engaged in the learning activities. Observations also suggest that children seemed to learn more easily through hands-on activities and by listening to stories.},

abstract = {From the perspective of high-quality and efficient intelligent problem solving in business decision-making, a artificial intelligence generated content solution is proposed. In order to solve this problem, a Artificial Intelligence Generated Content binary choice Probit model is used. The solution proposes feature engineering, model assumptions, variable selection, feedback iteration, and security and compliance technical methods to effectively solve the business decision-making process. A business decision data simulation experiment was conducted by using this model. Compared with the general decision-making system without Artificial Intelligence Generated Content, the reference data volume of this business decision-making system increased by 86.63 times, and the decision efficiency increased by 51.21%. The experimental values are key indicators such as return on equity and market value. The results show that this technical method has high accuracy and practical value in evaluating the stability of corporate business decisions and predicting debt repayment capability.},

abstract = {Written feedback has long been a cornerstone in educational and professional settings, essential for enhancing learning outcomes. However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing adaptive learning systems by fostering an environment where transparency is key to developing students' critical thinking skills. In such systems, each learner's experience is uniquely tailored, not just to their current knowledge and cognitive abilities, but also with the intent of expanding their reasoning and problem-solving capacities. The crux of XAI within these educational contexts lies in its ability to demystify AI decisions. This transparency allows learners to grasp the "why" and "how" of the AI-driven guidance they receive, thereby promoting a deeper level of self-reflection and metacognitive awareness. The integration of XAI into platforms like RiPPLE exemplifies this approach, where the system leverages crowdsourced data and learning science to offer personalized activity recommendations. By aligning these recommendations with individual knowledge states, and elucidating the underlying logic, XAI-equipped adaptive learning environments not only cater to the immediate educational needs but also lay the groundwork for cultivating autonomous and discerning thinkers.},

Though some of this falls under the academic misconduct policy of an institution, it can be confusing to students as to what qualifies as proper use. Students use tools like Grammarly, to improve their writing, and find more advanced AI tools, such as ChatGPT as an additional resource. For faculty to simply ban the use of these tools, creates an unworkable model. Embracing them can also be problematic as not all educational material benefits from a flipped approach. In this paper we discuss changing the dynamic by applying targeted assessments that incrementally address elements in an assignment, to affirm the work that students submitted and discourage use of improper tools that don't assist in learning.},

We introduce the first synthesis of these ideas in the context of teaching artificial intelligence (AI), which is now seen as a critical component of 21st-century education. Specifically, we explore the design of a narrative-based learnersourcing platform where engagement is centered around a learner-made choose-your-own-adventure story. In grounding our approach, we draw from pedagogical literature, digital storytelling, and recent work on learnersourcing. We report on our iterative, learner-centered design process as well as our study findings that demonstrate the platform’s positive effects on knowledge gains, interest in AI concepts, and the overall user experience of narrative-based learnersourcing technology.},

However, the overall impact of AI on agrifood systems remains unclear. In this article, we thoroughly review how AI techniques can transform agrifood systems and contribute to the modern agrifood industry. First, we summarize the data acquisition methods in agrifood systems, including acquisition, storage, and processing techniques. Second, we present a progress review of AI methods in agrifood systems, specifically in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, covering topics such as agrifood classification, growth monitoring, yield prediction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, we highlight potential challenges and promising research opportunities for transforming modern agrifood systems with AI.

The review highlights a trend in evaluating healthcare professionals (especially surgeons) motivated by the critical role of hands-on training in these professions. Besides, the review reveals that data fusion techniques and certain technologies, like transfer learning and explainable AI, are not widely utilized despite their huge potential. Finally, the review underscores that most proposals remain within the research domain, lacking the integration and maturity needed for sustained use in real-world environments. Therefore, most of the proposals are not currently available to support the training of professionals.

abstract = {Landscape renderings are realistic images of landscape sites, allowing stakeholders to perceive better and evaluate design ideas. While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI (generative artificial intelligence)) enable automated generation of landscape renderings, the End to End (endtoend) methods are not compatible with common design processes, leading to insufficient alignment with design idealizations and limited cohesion of iterative landscape design. Informed by a formative study for comprehending design requirements, we present PlantoGraphy, an iterative design system that allows for interactive configuration of generative artificial intelligence models to accommodate human-centered design practice. A two-stage pipeline is incorporated: first, the concretization module transforms conceptual ideas into concrete scene layouts with a domain-oriented large language model; and second, the illustration module converts scene layouts into realistic landscape renderings with a layout-guided diffusion model Fine-tune (finetune)ed through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (lora). PlantoGraphy has undergone a series of performance evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in landscape rendering generation and the high recognition of its interactive functionality.},

abstract = {Many approaches have been proposed to teach K-12 students fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence using Scratch. However, it remains challenging to perform more complex tasks, such as directly collecting data from the internet or employing custom artificial intelligence algorithms, relying solely on simple logical relationships and graphical elements or blocks. In this paper, We design and develop an artificial intelligence learning platform mediated by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This platform enables Scratch to communicate with text-based programming languages such as Python and JavaScript using WebSockets and ZeroMQ. To facilitate students' use of UAVs and artificial intelligence algorithms, the platform includes UAV extensions and various artificial intelligence algorithm extensions. We design five student-accessible artificial intelligence applications:(1)Measurement of the distance from the UAV to the horizontal plane using sensors while the UAV is in flight.(2)Access to network APIs for data retrieval, such as obtaining wind and weather forecasts.(3)Collection of handwritten digit data and recognition of handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a deep learning model.(4)Machine learning with a dataset related to Iris flower classification, followed by model building, training, and direct classification of Iris species based on four distinctive flower features.(5)Collection of object data, feature extraction, and deep learning training for object recognition, illustrated with gesture recognition as an example. The platform assists students in grasping fundamental programming principles and the core concepts of artificial intelligence, thereby sparking their interest in AI, and encouraging them to delve deeper into research and learning.},

abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention, especially in AI-powered autonomous and adaptive systems (AASs). However, a discernible disconnect exists among research efforts across different communities. The machine learning community often overlooks “explaining to whom,” while the human-computer interaction community has examined various stakeholders with diverse explanation needs without addressing which XAI methods meet these requirements. Currently, no clear guidance exists on which XAI methods suit which specific stakeholders and their distinct needs. This hinders the achievement of the goal of XAI: providing human users with understandable interpretations. To bridge this gap, this article presents a comprehensive XAI roadmap. Based on an extensive literature review, the roadmap summarizes different stakeholders, their explanation needs at different stages of the AI system lifecycle, the questions they may pose, and existing XAI methods. Then, by utilizing stakeholders’ inquiries as a conduit, the roadmap connects their needs to prevailing XAI methods, providing a guideline to assist researchers and practitioners to determine more easily which XAI methodologies can meet the specific needs of stakeholders in AASs. Finally, the roadmap discusses the limitations of existing XAI methods and outlines directions for future research.},

While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

Following that, we will collect additional details for future diagnostics. Patients with mild allergic reactions do not need to be hospitalized. Chatbot systems can help with the initial drug allergy screen and can follow instructions. This study investigates the design of an efficient chatbot and uses convolutional neural networks for image classification. The results show that the investigators' new set-up procedure for initial drug allergy screening and CNN model validation works, which means that this work could be used as a model for future research and development. Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly significant in medical technology. However, there are recommendations to further enhance data set preparation and bot responses.

This research explores the application of AI techniques like neural networks and genetic algorithms for multiphysics modeling, using an aerospace case example for educational purposes. A literature review examines existing physics-based and empirical modeling approaches in this domain. Subsequently, a multiphysics control model incorporating thermal, structural, and fluid dynamics interactions is developed. Neural networks can be trained on simulation data to learn these multiphysics relationships, with the potential to augment robotic assembly. Additionally, genetic algorithms optimize system designs by evolving populations of models based on performance objectives. This enables rapid virtual testing and discovery of optimal configurations. The integrated AI modeling framework builds on a systematic literature review, providing a reference architecture for multiphysics modeling and simulation. Literature findings facilitate developing an optimal methodology for a model example. The research demonstrates advancing complex engineering models via a sample pseudocode algorithm for electronic systems control.

They engaged in hands-on activities, including using traditional sensemaking practices in conjunction with sensor technology to collect contextual data. They then used a tangible educational tool: a corkboard with push pins and images to build tactile AI models based on their farm data. Throughout this process, they discussed their hopes and desires regarding AI in farming, and their concerns about AI technologies. The perspectives of the urban farmers reveal their preference for AI systems that are contextual, integrate community values, Indigenous knowledge, and environmental concerns, and are rooted in community ownership of data. Our report provides a starting point for conducting future workshops that involve 'critical participatory design' of AI technologies to promote AI literacies rooted in the community.},

abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence in the field of education has gone through several stages, initially using machine learning technology to optimize the teaching process to achieve automation of the "storage and calculation" function. Subsequently, through deep learning technology, the education has been able to realize the "visual and auditory" perceptual function. Nowadays, with the application of generalized big model, the education field is moving towards the cognitive stage of "understanding and creation". The purpose of this paper is to deeply analyze the challenges and dilemmas brought to programming education by the Generalized Big Model of Artificial Intelligence, and put forward the thinking of adjusting the educational objectives and programming content output under the ChatGPT Big Model for specific teaching.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to online and hybrid learning models, presenting unique challenges and opportunities in the educational sector. This study, conducted at Sultan Moulay Slimane University (USMS) in Morocco, explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance distance learning through the automatic generation of assessment questions from video content. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, the research aims to address the limitations of passive video watching and promote active learning and self-regulated learning skills. The methodology encompasses the use of speech recognition to transcribe video content, summarization techniques to distill core concepts, and a Text2Text generation model for creating relevant assessment questions. The study's findings demonstrate that the AI-driven question generation system can match the quality, diversity, and relevance of human-authored questions, thereby reducing instructor workload and fostering personalization and engagement in hybrid learning contexts. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on applying AI in education, offering insights and frameworks for adopting AI-driven methodologies to improve online pedagogies, assessments, and learning experiences in the post-pandemic era.},

abstract = {Promoting the integration and innovation of information technology within education is a key initiative in China's higher education reform. Dynamic monitoring of college students' academic performance provides a fundamental guarantee for improving the quality of talent cultivation. Leveraging artificial intelligence technology, this paper aims to reform and innovate the monitoring of academic quality among college students. By comprehensively collecting multidimensional academic data for in-depth mining, model analysis, and accurate prediction, the study seeks to uncover the complex relationships and scientific value behind the data, thus enabling effective monitoring and early warning of students' academic progress. This approach addresses the shortcomings of traditional academic monitoring methods, such as manual processing, long feedback cycles, and high subjectivity, which hinder scientific decision-making. The implementation of AI-based monitoring allows for a timely understanding of students' academic status at the institutional level and assists students in identifying and addressing their own learning deficiencies. Ultimately, this promotes the modernization of academic quality monitoring and enhances the overall quality of talent cultivation in higher education.},

abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence serves as an extension and expansion of human senses, surpassing human intelligence in areas such as data processing and data storage, while remaining weak in emotional awareness. By leveraging the strengths of both, a synergy between the two can achieve integrated intelligence. The collaboration between AI and teachers in teaching addresses the shortcomings of relying solely on either AI or human teachers, forming a complex system that combines their respective advantages. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the futures of AI and teacher for collaborative teaching. Additionally, it discusses four types of collaborative processes supported by AI-teacher teaching systems, analyzing how data circulation and utilization can be enhanced through the four stages of data production, data transformation, data application, and data feedback. Finally, a Chinese language class supported by AI-teacher collaboration was conducted and implemented in a base school in a certain city for sixth-grade students, to analyze the key elements and operational mechanisms in the human-machine collaborative classroom, providing theoretical and practical references for AI-teacher collaborative teaching.},

abstract = {The rapid development of Internet technology has made learning in the Internet environment gradually become a new trend. Traditional learning resources cannot meet people's needs for rich and diverse resources. The application of the Internet has brought real-time and diverse characteristics to learning resources. The online learning environment provides people with a more flexible and convenient learning method. However, as learning resources continue to increase, how to effectively allocate and schedule these resources has become an urgent problem to be solved. Traditional resource scheduling methods rely on manual intervention and cannot be real-time and automated. This article believes that intelligent algorithms have the characteristics of adaptability and strong self-learning ability, so applying this method can effectively optimize and schedule resources. In order to verify the advantages of the algorithm, this article compares the performance of traditional scheduling methods with genetic algorithms, artificial neural network algorithms and particle swarm optimization algorithms, and conducts quantitative analysis based on the real-time nature of learning resources and scheduling results. Experimental results show that the particle swarm algorithm has the shortest response time and the highest utilization rate (89%).},

In this project, we try to combine the existing AI technology with online game design, and study a feasible online game design road based on AI algorithm. A decision-making model of game AI behavior is designed, and the proposed genetic SASarsa algorithm takes the value of exploration rate as the solution of chromosomes in the genetic process, and also represents the state in the annealing process. In the design of game AI engine, multithreading mechanism and the design pattern of producers and consumers are introduced, and the near-end strategy optimization algorithm is used to improve the search efficiency. Experiments show that reinforcement learning method can use the same reward function for similar intelligent agents, so as to achieve action decisions that conform to the game world view and set after training. It can complete the construction of game AI without reorganizing the decision structure, and improve the intelligence level of intelligent agents in the game.},

This paper investigates faculty members' perceptions of using artificial intelligence, chatbots, and generative AI in teaching and learning in Uzbeki's higher education contexts. The researchers employed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to collect the data. Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants in this study, and the interviews were conducted face-to-face at the university campus. The study's underlying theory is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which were employed as a lens to direct the research. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the deductive approach for the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that lecturers have a positive attitude to adopt and use AI for content creation, assessment and feedback, and doing research in their institution. Some instructors may see it as a valuable tool for generating creative content and aiding student learning. In contrast, others may have concerns about its potential to replace human creativity or biases in generated materials. Lecturers also view AI as a technology to achieve accessibility and equity after overcoming the challenges. Findings revealed that some measurements should be taken about the facilitating conditions and the perceived risks of using AI.},

abstract = {Generative AI changes the paradigm of natural language processing research, sets off a new trend of research in computational humanities and computational social sciences, and provides unique perspectives on digital intelligence-enabled ancient book revitalization and intelligent applications. The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.},

abstract = {To discuss the application of artificial intelligence (AI) speech synthesis technology and wireless network technology in English listening teaching, firstly, the present situation of English listening teaching is analyzed. Secondly, a questionnaire is designed to investigate the feasibility of AI speech synthesis technology in English listening teaching. Finally, the control group (a traditional mode of English listening teaching) and experimental group (AI speech synthesis technology) are set up, compared, and analyzed. The survey shows that for natural fluency, speech synthesis has the lowest score. The textbook audio score is the highest, with an average score of 4.23. According to the mean opinion score (MOS), the AI speech synthesis technology belongs to high-quality speech coding. Therefore, the English audio generated by combining AI speech synthesis technology under wireless network technology also has high quality. Meanwhile, 113 people in the survey consider that the clear articulation of the synthesized audio is full marks, which is clearer than the English audio matching the textbook, indicating that students think the English audio of the supporting textbook is poor in the clear articulation, which affects students’ listening. Moreover, the English listening scores of the experimental group are notably better than those of the control group. It is hoped that the traditional teaching mode can be better integrated with wireless networks and AI technology, thereby improving the clarity of English listening, providing mobile learning, and advancing students' English performance and learning efficiency.},

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may reshape how participatory design is conducted. To explore the emerging implications of supporting stakeholders with AI, we conducted a systematic review (n = 14) of empirical studies. The literature suggests that AI can improve the accessibility and quality of participatory design by lowering the participatory threshold, and facilitating process execution, collaboration, and creation. Stakeholders’ use of AI also poses risks of relying on biased models, causing cognitive overload, and leading stakeholders to uncritically fixate on AI input, potentially diminishing the quality of design outcomes. Based on these findings, we explore the evolving role of AI in participatory design—and call for future research on its fallibility, participatory nature, and potential for exacerbating stakeholder vulnerabilities. Herewith, this review contributes to our understanding of how AI can support stakeholders in participatory design.},

In this paper, we explore the applicability of approval regulation - that is, regulation of a product that combines experimental minima with government licensure conditioned partially or fully upon that experimentation - to the regulation of frontier AI. There are a number of reasons to believe that approval regulation, simplistically applied, would be inapposite for frontier AI risks. Domains of weak fit include the difficulty of defining the regulated product, the presence of Knightian uncertainty or deep ambiguity about harms from AI, the potentially transmissible nature of risks, and distributed activities among actors involved in the AI lifecycle. We conclude by highlighting the role of policy learning and experimentation in regulatory development, describing how learning from other forms of AI regulation and improvements in evaluation and testing methods can help to overcome some of the challenges we identify.},

These technologies have not only reshaped the teaching environment, but also increased the capacity requirements for teachers. However, the actual deployment of AI education still faces many challenges. Despite this, the effectiveness of AI technology in university teaching has begun to appear. Looking to the future, the application of AI will not only not weaken the role of teachers, but will also promote their professional development. To achieve this, teachers need to actively improve their digital literacy and master new technologies. At the same time, it is crucial to ensure the fair use of AI in education, and algorithmic regulation needs to be strengthened to avoid exacerbating inequalities. In addition, we should pay attention to the environmental and social impacts of technology to ensure that it promotes an equitable, inclusive and sustainable education ecosystem.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.},

Implementing AI models at scale and ensuring cost-effective production of AI-based technologies through entirely in-house capabilities is a challenge. The success of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Computing models can be leveraged to facilitate a cost-effective and scalable AI service paradigm, namely, “AI as a Service” (AIaaS). We summarize current state-of-the-art solutions for AIaaS, and we discuss its prospects for growth and opportunities to advance the concept. To this end, we perform a thorough review of recent research on AI and various deployment strategies for emerging domains considering both technical as well as survey articles. Next, we identify various characteristics and capabilities that need to be met before an AIaaS model can be successfully designed and deployed. Based on this, we present a general framework of an AIaaS architecture that integrates the required aaS characteristics with the capabilities of AI. We also compare various approaches for offering AIaaS to end users. Finally, we illustrate several real-world use cases for AIaaS models, followed by a discussion of some of the challenges that must be addressed to enable AIaaS adoption.},

Currently, only generic standards exist and they are difficult to put into operation due to the lack of the required skills and knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents a vision model based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence that supports developers' decisions to integrate concrete design methods in the automotive development life-cycle. Organizations need to develop their process for developing vehicle components that comply with the new automotive standards.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic further amplified the utilization of these systems, which necessitated their integration into educational curricula for both lecturers and students. However, adopting LMSs within SE education has presented distinctive challenges impeding their seamless incorporation into the courses. This paper aims to scrutinize the challenges and requirements encountered by professors, lecturers, and students in the domain of SE education when using LMSs. We conducted an empirical study that included (i) a survey with 47 professors/lecturers and 133 students, (ii) an analysis of the ensuing data, and (iii) 18 additional interviews conducted with professors and lecturers to delve into nuanced variations in viewpoints. The findings derived from our study reveal that the challenges and requirements pertaining to LMSs are rather specific depending on the scope and size of the respective courses. Nevertheless, many participants have a consensus on numerous challenges and requirements for improving certain features of LMSs in order to improve their usage in SE education. The findings are valuable for advancing research and development in the field of LMSs and provide guidance for lecturers in SE education.},

Drawing on the Data Feminism framework, we explored the perspectives of community organization members on their partnerships with AI teams through 16 semi-structured interviews. Our study highlights the pervasive influence of funding agendas and the optimism surrounding AI's potential. Despite the significant intellectual contributions and labor provided by community organization members, their goals were frequently sidelined in favor of other stakeholders, including AI teams. While many community organization members expected tangible project deployment, only two out of 14 projects we studied reached the deployment stage. However, community organization members sustained their belief in the potential of the projects, still seeing diminished goals as valuable. To enhance the efficacy of future collaborations, our participants shared their aspirations for success, calling for co-leadership starting from the early stages of projects. We propose data co-liberation as a grounding principle for approaching AI4SG moving forward, positing that community organizations' co-leadership is essential for fostering more effective, sustainable, and ethical development of AI.},

abstract = {The ongoing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within higher education (HE) signifies a pivotal shift in pedagogical paradigms, demanding comprehensive theoretical and practical considerations. This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

abstract = {With the development of exploration and trade, the coffee industry blossomed, and coffee gradually became an essential social drink for its unique taste and captivating aroma. Among various industrial coffee-producing processes, coffee bean classification is of great importance, which involves classifying beans into different qualities as multiple kinds of beans contain distinct characteristics, such as fermentation, sucrose, and sour degrees, influencing coffee beverage quality control, price setting, and even consumers` health. To the best of our knowledge, a prevailing approach for classification is machine learning based on neural networks. Unfortunately, even though high accuracy could be accomplished, it is hard to convey convincing results to researchers or industry personnel due to the ‘black-box’ property of the neural network, which indicates that we have little information about the inner mechanism in the neural network except for its inputs and outputs, jeopardizing the transparency and reliability of the neural network. Excellent interpretability is meaningful for retailers and consumers to know why the outputs are reliable. To begin with, in this paper, we will stress the importance of the high-accuracy classified coffee bean. Secondly, we will introduce the deep neural network technique to improve its high-accuracy classification. Last, we will demonstrate the XAI technique (GradCAM, etc.) to enhance explainability and interpretability. We improved the interpretability of the heatmap results produced by GradCAM and GradCAM++, and we also found out that they are presented differently. As XAI approaches, the versatile GradCAM provides high-resolution heatmaps to assist in understanding the regions of pictures that contribute much to the classification results, and the GradCAM++ produces much more precise results on accurately locating the contributing regions, including a better presentation of the unique distinct features of each class.},

abstract = {Understanding binary code is an essential but complex software engineering task for reverse engineering, malware analysis, and compiler optimization. Unlike source code, binary code has limited semantic information, which makes it challenging for human comprehension. At the same time, compiling source to binary code, or transpiling among different programming languages (PLs) can provide a way to introduce external knowledge into binary comprehension. We propose to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that aid human comprehension of binary code. Specifically, we propose to incorporate domain knowledge from large corpora of source code (e.g., variable names, comments) to build AI models that capture a generalizable representation of binary code. Lastly, we will investigate metrics to assess the performance of models that apply to binary code by using human studies of comprehension.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning, a branch of AI that has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this article, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this article can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.},

An understanding of people's perceptions of AI can be leveraged to design and deploy AI systems toward human needs and values. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals in the general public and 20 AI experts in the United States (U.S.) to assess perceptions of AI across levels of expertise. Qualitative analysis revealed that ideas about humanness and ethics were central to perceptions of AI in both groups. Humanness, the set of traits considered to distinguish humans from other intelligent actors, was used to articulate beliefs about AI's characteristics. Ethics arose in discussions of the role of technology in society and centered around views of AI as made and used by people. General public and expert participants expressed similar perceptions of AI, but articulated beliefs slightly differently. We discuss the implications of humanness-related beliefs and ethical concerns for AI development and deployment.},

Using these working definitions and data from municipal governments in Mexico, we develop a system dynamics model to explore some potential tradeoffs in the process of developing an enterprise view of information systems and data to create capability to develop AI applications in government.

abstract = {Scholars and industry practitioners have debated how to best develop interventions for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of "AI" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.},

For a given privacy policy, CompA\i{} semantically analyzes its textual content against a comprehensive conceptual model which captures all information types that might appear in any policy. Based on this analysis, alongside some input from the end user, CompA\i{} can determine the potential incompleteness violations in the input policy with an accuracy of ≈96%. CompA\i{} generates a detailed report that can be easily reviewed and validated by experts.

abstract = {Digital twin (DT) can improve the efficiency of data processing, simulation, prediction, and strategy formulation, instrumental in enhancing the performance of aquatic product supply chains in data perception, real-time analysis, intelligent decision-making, and precise execution. The DT-based aquatic product supply chain model encompasses 5 layers: perception, data, operation, function, and application. When constructing the supply chain for aquatic products, the artificial intelligence technologies have to be integrated, and object twinning, process twinning, system twinning, and value chain twinning as 4 stages should be facilitated sequentially to make the supply chain more adaptable and resilient.},

abstract = {With the popularity of online learning and the development of generative artificial intelligence technology, a significant scale of dishonest behaviors have emerged in the online learning environment, directly harming the construction and development of online learning ecology. Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

abstract = {Problem: The problem of the finalized exploration revolved around the inadequacy of current traffic forecasting models. Despite decades of examination in many fields, existing approaches, often relying on linear models and stationary time series assumptions, struggle to accurately predict traffic under chaotic events. The identified limitation has profound consequences, evident in the significant economic losses and time inefficiencies incurred due to traffic congestion, as exemplified by the $144 billion in losses and the 34% increase in travel time for drivers in Los Angeles County in 2013. The challenge lies in the inherently unpredictable nature of traffic events, ranging from regular rush hours causing sharp declines in traffic speed to unpredictable accidents leading to unforeseen delays. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a more effective and adaptive traffic forecasting model that can reliably operate under both normal and abnormal traffic conditions, addressing the shortcomings of traditional linear models and stationary time series assumptions. Purpose: The purpose of the completed investigation was to determine whether a traffic forecasting model that incorporates machine learning and deep learning technologies can yield effective traffic forecasts based on real-time weather and traffic data. Method: The study involved the development of a traffic forecasting model as informed by existing literature. Data collection was done through simulating data similar to the traffic data from Los Angeles County that was utilized in Yu et al.’s research on deep learning and traffic prediction in extreme weather scenarios [1]. Data analysis was done through MAE and t-test. Results: The findings demonstrated that the created traffic forecasting model outperformed the current methods in its ability to provide traffic forecasts with a better degree of accuracy. Conclusion: Regardless of the traffic volume, weather, or time of day, the developed traffic forecasting algorithm can give precise real-time traffic predictions.},

abstract = {This study delves into the impact of artificial intelligence on students’ learning.The paper pioneers the use of k-means classification to reduce the dimensionality of features before the classification process, which minimizes redundant information and computational overhead. This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with “whether AI assistance was used to complete the paper” as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students’ use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories. The results indicate that the majority of students support the use of AI technology to enhance their abilities, although some students may only intend to use AI to cope with exams and similar tasks.},

abstract = {Online or distance learning presents the cortical asset for equality, engagement and inclusion. However, these concepts do not guarantee success. There are still some challenges in choosing methods of how to use and combine online tools successfully as well as on the tool design. For instance, low engagement with online learning environments is frequent and diverse. This issue may be because there is no careful thoughtfulness of practices or the tools used themself are too awkward or do not support well the contextual needs of the learners. Simple issues such as internet connection, tool ecology mismatch and choice of practices are also crucial for design consideration. Our framework follows cognitive brain research as it provides a clear starting point of combining design and practices for better online learning. Some of the brain research findings fit design and learning and are known to all but demonstrate to be true by brain research recently (For example, issues such as physical activity as well as active self-controlled thinking help learning. Similarly, sleeping enough boosts learning, constructive and timely feedback enhance learning, and having and keeping attention is crucial, but dependent on working memory and meaning-making also provides the long term memory and transferability. These points are basic elements of good design.},

abstract = {TRE (teaching reflection evaluation) is a continuous process, which helps to improve teaching quality, stimulate students' interest, meet their needs, and support the mission and objectives of educational institutions. Intelligent assessment of teachers' teaching reflection is a method to support and enhance teachers' reflection and self-evaluation by using AI (artificial intelligence) technology. Based on the index system of teaching reflection of university teachers, this paper studies the design of intelligent evaluation system of teaching reflection of university teachers with AI as technical support and Matlab programming. The mathematical model is established by using BPNN (BP neural network) model structure, and the neural network is trained by using expert samples. According to the scores of online students on various evaluation indexes of teachers' classroom teaching, the trained neural network is used for data processing, so as to obtain the final evaluation result. The experimental data show that the training and prediction accuracy of teacher TRE model based on BPNN is completely within the acceptable range, which is a reasonable and feasible prediction model and can objectively and fairly evaluate teachers' teaching reflection.},

Through these interviews, we identify and discuss key issues in the infusion of AI into cities. These interviewees were key players in their respective cities’ response to the challenge and opportunity of novel technologies, including AI. As such, while our sampling is small, these interviewees are a good representation of the relevant individuals who hold sway over the thoughts, visions, ideas and challenges that are recognized in their respective organizations. We ask, how do these individuals understand AI and gauged through their views, how are these cities prepared for the increasing and continuous infusion of artificial intelligence technologies in these cities’ agendas, practices and projects?},

abstract = {Objectives This study investigates gender biases in Artificial Intelligence (AI) perceptions among university students. It focuses on assessing self-perceptions regarding knowledge, impact, and support, with a specific emphasis on identifying any significant gender differences. The main hypotheses are focused on the existence of gender disparities in AI awareness, perceptions, and attitudes among higher education students.Participants The study involves 380 participants, enrolled in undergraduate courses across various academic disciplines. Participants are university students with diverse backgrounds in terms of age, academic majors, and prior exposure to AI technologies.Study Methods This research employs an observational study design. The sample size includes 380 participants. The study utilises a structured questionnaire as the primary instrument for data collection. Outcome measures focus on variables such as perceived knowledge of AI, perceived impact of AI, and levels of support or apprehension towards AI technologies.Findings The findings reveal significant gender differences, with females exhibiting lower levels than their male counterparts in the level of perceived knowledge about AI ( (p&lt;0.005) ), exposure awareness ( (p=0.001) ), perceived ability to apply AI ( (p=0.004) ), sensitivity towards AI use of private data ( (p=0.004) ), positive impact on society ( (p=0.002) ), support for AI development ( (p&lt;0.005) ), and positive expectations towards AI ( (p&lt;0.005) ). Statistical analysis, including non-parametric tests, was used to validate these observations.Conclusions There are notable gender biases in the knowledge and perception of AI among university students. These biases have implications for the future development and adoption of AI technologies, suggesting a need for more gender-inclusive educational strategies in AI. The findings underscore the importance of addressing gender disparities in AI education to ensure equitable access and understanding of these technologies. It is important to integrate gender perspectives in AI curriculum and policy-making to mitigate potential biases and enhance inclusivity in the field of AI.},

Designers, as a special user group interacting with AI, have received more attention in the Human-Computer Interaction community. Prior work has discussed emerging challenges that persist in designing for AI. However, few systematic reviews focus on AI for design to understand how designers and AI can augment each other's complementary strengths in design collaboration. In this work, we conducted a landscape analysis of AI for design, via a systematic literature review of 93 papers. The analysis first provides a bird's eye view of overall patterns in this area. The analysis also reveals three themes interpreted from the paper corpus associated with AI for design, including AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and characterizing designer-AI collaboration. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggested methodological proposals to guide HCI toward research and practices that center on collaborative creativity.},

abstract = {Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical decision support systems (CDSS) poses a socio-technological challenge that is impacted by usability, trust, and human-computer interaction (HCI). AI-CDSS interventions have shown limited benefit in clinical outcomes, which may be due to insufficient understanding of how health-care providers interact with AI systems. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance AI-CDSS, but haven’t been studied in either simulated or real-world clinical scenarios. We present findings from a randomized controlled trial deploying AI-CDSS for the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with and without an LLM interface within realistic clinical simulations for physician and medical student participants. We find evidence that LLM augmentation improves ease-of-use, that LLM-generated responses with citations improve trust, and HCI varies based on clinical expertise. Qualitative themes from interviews suggest the perception of LLM-augmented AI-CDSS as a team-member used to confirm initial clinical intuitions and help evaluate borderline decisions.},

abstract = {Machine intelligence relies on Al (artificial intelligence) trainers, workers who perform labor such as data annotation and algorithm optimization. However, the promise of Al does not often benefit workers equally; instead, it puts them in precarious situations, such as low wages and subordination to machines. My dissertation takes an interdisciplinary approach to draw attention to these pressing issues by exploring the sociotechnical, cultural, and economic dimensions of this emergent technology-mediated labor in the context of large data infrastructures. My arguments and proposed concepts (e.g., sociotechnical/algorithmic mobility) respond directly to the under-theorization of mobility research and ecologically unequal exchange theory in HCI. In my dissertation, I argue that the Al trainers, who often work in developing regions of western China, are shouldering the burdens of (1) alleviating China’s poverty through Al for development programs, (2) sustaining Eastern China’s platform economy as key participants in large-scale data infrastructure projects, and (3) promoting global Al advancement by providing disembodied labor on products such as high-quality training datasets through repetitive and low-paying work. Using multi-sited ethnography and participatory design methods, my dissertation describes the experiences of under-resourced and under-studied Al trainer communities and the effects of AI on them. It will also offer context-sensitive design recommendations for supporting emergent technology-mediated labor and policy interventions for ethical and sustainable Al training practices.},

While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

AI interference into education, especially into language teaching has enabled educators to carry out a number of administrative tasks, such as reviewing and grading students’ assignments, preparing different activities for lessons more effectively and within short time. In addition, AI has been embedded into miscellaneous chatbots and online learning platforms, offering wide range of study materials and making learners be more autonomous as well as self-confident.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence has become an important force driving the development of today's era. In recent years, artificial intelligence education has gradually been promoted and popularized in primary and secondary schools across the country and has become a key focus of educational researchers. However, the popularization of artificial intelligence education in primary and secondary schools is currently in the initial exploration stage, and research related to artificial intelligence classrooms is relatively lacking. Therefore, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the artificial intelligence classroom in primary schools, this study starts from the perspective of interactive behavior in artificial intelligence classroom teaching in primary schools. Based on the improved Flanders Interaction Analysis System (iFIAS), video analysis method is adopted, and actual teaching videos of primary school artificial intelligence classroom are selected as the research object. The analysis is conducted from aspects such as the interactive structure of artificial intelligence classroom teaching and the tendency of teacher interaction style, In order to explore the interactive behavior patterns of teaching in artificial intelligence classrooms in primary schools, and lay the foundation for subsequent practical research on artificial intelligence classroom teaching.},

abstract = {With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence in General Chat (AIGC), represented by ChatGPT, collaborative learning tasks between university students and machines have become a new norm in higher education. Simply prohibiting this new wave of technology cannot fundamentally address its challenges. This article presents the results of a survey investigating Chinese university students' perspectives on generative artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, in supporting their learning. It analyzes the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology. Universities need to adapt to this transformation by altering the nature of student assignments and the methods of assessment. Additionally, they must effectively leverage the advantages of students conveniently acquiring knowledge through AIGC and the opportunity for personalized tutoring across various subjects. Striking the right balance between opportunities and challenges is crucial for creating a more productive and beneficial learning environment. Ultimately, this adaptation will better prepare education for the developments and changes in the era of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Children with high-functioning autism (HFA) often face challenges in emotional recognition and expression, leading to emotional distress and social difficulties. Conversational agents developed for HFA children in previous studies show limitations in children's learning effectiveness due to the conversational agents’ inability to dynamically generate personalized and contextual content. Recent advanced generative Artificial Intelligence techniques, with the capability to generate substantial diverse and high-quality texts and visual content, offer an opportunity for personalized assistance in emotional learning for HFA children. Based on the findings of our formative study, we integrated large language models and text-to-image models to develop a tool named EmoEden supporting children with HFA. Over a 22-day study involving six HFA children, it is observed that EmoEden effectively engaged children and improved their emotional recognition and expression abilities. Additionally, we identified the advantages and potential risks of applying generative AI to assist HFA children in emotional learning.},

abstract = {This article proposes an innovative lifelong learning method designed specifically for vehicle trajectory prediction, aiming to address the limitations of traditional prediction models when facing dynamic traffic environments and data timeliness issues. With the development of intelligent transportation systems, accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories is of great significance for traffic management, route planning, autonomous driving safety, and other aspects. However, existing models often require retraining when new data is introduced, which is not only time-consuming but may also lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. This study designed a vehicle trajectory prediction framework that can continuously learn and adapt to changes in the traffic environment by introducing a lifelong learning mechanism. The core of this framework lies in combining deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques, while introducing incremental learning and regularization strategies to balance the learning of new knowledge with the retention of old knowledge. In addition, we have incorporated attention mechanisms to enable the model to dynamically focus on the most critical information segments for prediction, further improving prediction accuracy.},

Three principal modeling strategies are examined: cognitive mind modeling, assignation mind modeling, and intelligent body mind modeling. In the article, he explores a few theories, such as symbol systems and the ACT-R framework. It further argues that learning seems limited in encoding models of the mind, citing its successes in language-oriented tasks and its limitations in translating basic mechanisms like reward to model-level language and data from neuroscience. Additionally, it investigates ways of assessing and enhancing learning theory of mind abilities based on tasks that utilize end-to-end function. The review reiterates the need for an improved understanding of human-level thought processing to develop intelligent systems that can better discern intentions and feelings. It provides some ideas on evaluating this based on deep learning approaches. The review argues that viewing learning through the lens of systems yields new insights into human thought and social behavior that could enable the development of novel and more adaptive AI technologies.},

With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence technology and its deep integration with the media industry, intelligent algorithms are increasingly being integrated into social life and development processes, thereby becoming a significant determinant influencing human production and livelihood. In the context of the rapid advancement of digital technology, a series of derived risks associated with the "Social Embedding" process of artificial intelligence algorithms have been overlooked by both academia and industry. The paper elaborates on the fundamental structure of embedded in the society in artificial intelligence algorithms, examining them from several perspectives. It identifies various derived risks associated with embedded in the society and proposes a novel model for embedded in the society based on the concept of building a community for social governance. Furthermore, it presents an innovative model for governing AI algorithms within this "Social Governance Community" framework to enhance algorithm governance effectiveness and address derived risks arising from their embedded in the society.},

Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.},

abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

The hardware configuration of the advertisement animation design system is optimized by using IE9 - Chromel mainstream controller, image encoder and AEMS870F1451 processing chip, and the remote design processing port of the advertisement animation is improved to ensure the stability of the system operation. At the same time, we simplify the steps of advertisement animation design by combining the visual communication principle and calculate the three-dimensional coordinates of advertisement animation, so as to realize the effective design of advertisement animation. Finally, the experiment confirms that the visual communication-based advertising animation design system runs with relatively higher smoothness and fully meets the research requirements.},

abstract = {The native language of an individual is the language acquired naturally in early childhood, typically from their family and immediate community. Native language acquisition intrinsically involves several linguistic components that help individuals develop their language skills, such as morphology, pragmatics, syntax, and semantics. In this work the goal is to predict Spanish language fluency by quantification of these linguistic components using an artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline. The pipeline includes a novel Spanish language question-answer dataset, automatic question text generation, data augmentation, preprocessing using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and a Transformer model that integrates the components to quantify and provide a prediction of fluency. We found that our model is able to predict language fluency with high accuracy using the components: morphology, syntax and pragmatics with higher scores for syntax. The results of this study show the possibility of the use of AI to verify if an individual is fluent in a particular language.},

Despite the prevalence of AI applications, the general public are not necessarily equipped with the ability to understand how the black-box algorithms work and how to deal with biases. To inform designs for explainable AI (XAI), we conducted in-depth interviews with major stakeholders, both end-users (n = 24) and engineers (n = 15), to investigate how they made sense of AI applications and the associated biases according to situations of high and low stakes. We discussed users’ perceptions and attributions about AI biases and their desired levels and types of explainability. We found that personal relevance and boundaries as well as the level of stake are two major dimensions for developing user trust especially during biased situations and informing XAI designs.},

abstract = {This study proposes a theoretical architecture model of an AI-driven in-vehicle interactive system, optimizing and adjusting key aspects such as target group selection, driving stages, consumer needs, interaction modes, and interface design through detailed demonstration. It emphasizes the personalization factor and proposes a model more aligned with the user's personalized needs by subdividing the driving stages and analyzing consumer needs. In terms of interaction modes, attention is paid to the integration of clicks, voice control, gestures, sliding, and other interaction methods to improve the flexibility of the user's operating experience. In terms of interface design, through elements such as colour, icons, typography, and fonts, combined with the automatic optimization of AI, personalized design is achieved to adapt better to the user's driving situation and preferences. Overall, this model aims to improve in-vehicle interactive systems' performance and user experience and provide a valuable reference for the future intelligent driving field. The study also profoundly explores the application of AI in the personalized design of vehicle interactive interfaces through a literature review and empirical cases, providing critical insights into achieving personalization and intelligence for future vehicle interaction design.},

The impacts of AI components on the design and use of application systems are evolving rapidly as improved deep learning techniques and fresh big data sources afford effective and efficient solutions for broad ranges of applications. New goals and requirements for Human-AI System (HAIS) functions and qualities are emerging, whereas the boundaries between human and machine behaviors continue to blur. This research commentary identifies and addresses the design science research (DSR) challenges facing the field of Information Systems as the demand for human-machine synergies in Human-Artificial Intelligence Systems surges in all application areas. The design challenges of HAIS are characterized by a taxonomy of eight C's - composition, complexity, creativity, confidence, controls, conscience, certification, and contribution. By applying a design science research frame to structure and investigate HAIS design, implementation, use, and evolution, we propose a forward-thinking agenda for relevant and rigorous information systems research contributions.},

To stimulate further research on data provenance that enables responsible AI, this study outlines existing biases and discusses possible implementations of data provenance to mitigate them. We first review biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing. We then discuss the current state of practice, the challenges it presents, and corresponding recommendations to address them. We present a summary highlighting how our recommendations can help establish data provenance and thereby mitigate biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing to realize responsible AI-based systems.

Thus, to fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of these methods. In this review, we apply a methodology proposed in the literature that locates existing studies, selects and evaluates contributions, analyses, and synthesizes data. We used Google Scholar and databases such as Elsevier's Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select documents. The results showed that when AI methods are used in VR applications, the main advantages are high efficiency and precision of algorithms. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is the most applied AI scientific technique in VR applications. In conclusion, this paper showed that the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends, opportunities, and applications for human-machine interactive devices, education, agriculture, transport, 3D image reconstruction, and health. We also concluded that the usage of AI in VR provides potential benefits in other fields of the real world such as teleconferencing, emotion interaction, tourist services, and image data extraction.},

abstract = {Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

abstract = {With the intensifying demographic shift towards aging and the dawn of the intelligent society, vocational colleges have emerged as pivotal players in serving societal needs, rendering the promotion of profound integration between artificial intelligence (AI) and geriatric education an inevitable trend of our times. However, current challenges in vocational colleges include a scarcity of proficient educators specialized in elderly education, necessitating enhancement of professional competencies; a mismatch in resource supply and demand, coupled with low resource utilization efficiency; inadequate technical support, demanding optimization of service quality; simplistic teaching methodologies devoid of modern instructional tools; and an unreasonable curriculum evaluation standard, lacking a dynamic assessment mechanism.In response to these issues, this study meticulously delineates the implementation roadmap for the "Artificial Intelligence + Elderly Education" teaching model, encompassing five core dimensions: defining learning objectives, designing instructional content, innovating teaching methodologies and learning processes, integrating teaching resources, and establishing evaluation and feedback mechanisms. Furthermore, it endeavors to explore practical strategies for leveraging AI to address existing challenges in vocational colleges' endeavors to educate the elderly, thereby offering valuable insights for the sustainable development of geriatric education.},

We conducted four focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews with 26 UX practitioners to investigate how AIGC tools influence social dynamics in UX collaboration. Our findings indicated that AIGC tools not only mitigated conflicts but also introduced potential new conflicts. AIGC tools expanded the roles of UX practitioners and fostered a team culture characterized by exploring and discussing. Participants have higher expectations for AI-assisted design in user understanding and prototype evaluation, and team-motivated AI tools learning. Based on these findings, we discussed the benefits and concerns of conflict resolution through AIGC and the importance of teams in AI learning. Finally, we proposed several suggestions for future AI design research.},

abstract = {The rise of AI stems from the combined progress of big data, algorithms, and computing power. At present, the rapid development of global rail transit, whether subway, light rail or high-speed rail, are experiencing unprecedented growth rate development. This is due to the acceleration of urbanization on the one hand, but also due to technological progress on the other hand. Rail transit systems are deeply integrated with the latest communication, sensor and artificial intelligence technologies to achieve intelligent operations. Failures caused by aging and improper maintenance of equipment occur from time to time, affecting operational efficiency and even passenger safety. As the rail transit system is usually very complex, it is difficult to achieve accurate prediction and preventive maintenance, in this context, the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of rail transit vehicle equipment becomes particularly important. In this paper, artificial intelligence is introduced into the equipment monitoring and maintenance system of rail transit, which is conducive to optimizing the system capacity and improving the data processing efficiency. In this paper, experimental method and comparison method are used to analyze the fault detection in the condition monitoring and maintenance of vehicle equipment, and the performance of different fault types, active semi-supervised learning and random sampling methods are compared and described. The experimental results show that random sampling is 0.01 higher than active semi-supervised learning only when the amount of data annotation is 2000.},

abstract = {The law and ethics of Western democratic states have their basis in liberalism. This extends to regulation and ethical discussion of technology and businesses doing data processing. Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes. An attention cooperative, that prioritizes its incoming and outgoing data flows, is one model of a social system that could form and maintain its own autonomous purpose.},

Recently, there have been several architectural innovations for AI using emerging nanotechnology. These architectures implement mathematical computations of AI with circuits that utilize physical behavior of nanodevices purpose-built for such computations. This approach leads to a much greater efficiency vs. software algorithms running on von Neumann processors or CMOS architectures, which emulate the operations with transistor circuits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these architectural directions and categorize them based on their contributions.

Expanded reality innovation is a sort of mixture picture handling innovation, which is one of the significant innovations that would influence the improvement of fundamental schooling in the following five years. It can seamlessly output virtual objects to the real environment, which is convenient for this paper to obtain and absorb information. It can also help students to participate in exploration and cultivate their creativity and imagination. It can strengthen the cooperation between students and teachers and create various learning environments. It has an immeasurable prospect of development in the field of education. The primary school English teaching resources based on augmented reality create a realistic learning situation from two-dimensional plane to three-dimensional three-dimensional display, and enrich the presentation of primary school English teaching content. It can stimulate students’ interest in learning English and promote the transformation of English teaching methods. It is a useful attempt in the field of education. This paper made statistics on the test results of the experimental class and the control class. Most of the scores of the experimental group were between 71 and 100, a total of 27, accounting for 67.5%. The score distribution of the control class was relatively balanced, with the highest number between 61-70, and the number was 10, accounting for 25%. Therefore, it can be seen that hybrid image processing technology is important for interactive English teaching.},

The control system of a Pressure Oxidation facility was evaluated to determine potential opportunities for the integration of Artificial Intelligence. Several challenges were identified during the start-up operations of the Autoclave including typographical errors, possible non-compliance with Standard Operating Procedures, and the need for expertise to manage the operations. These conditions satisfy the need to explore an AI system that can potentially minimize human intervention. Through related reviews, this study suggested a hybrid approach through incorporation of safe oxygen operation limits as part of supervised learning and to develop predictive models using historical data to predict the optimal oxygen requirement to achieve maximum oxidation results thereby making the POX process an ideal candidate for Artificial Intelligence system integration. A data flow diagram and user interface prototype were developed to illustrate the role of the proposed Artificial Intelligence system in controlling the Autoclave, which can significantly minimize human errors that can potentially improve safety and boost productivity.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, have performed interestingly well when assisting developers on computer programming tasks, a.k.a., coding, thus potentially resulting in convenient and faster software constructions. This new approach significantly enhances efficiency but also presents challenges in unsupervised code construction with limited security guarantees. LLMs excel in producing code with accurate grammar, yet they are not specifically trained to guarantee the security of the code. In this paper, we provide an initial exploration into using formal software specifications as a starting point for software construction, allowing developers to translate descriptions of security-related behavior into natural language instructions for LLMs, a.k.a., prompts. In addition, we leveraged automated verification tools to evaluate the code produced against the aforementioned specifications , following a modular, step-by-step software construction process. For our study, we leveraged Role-based Access Control (RBAC), a mature security model, and the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral specification language for Java. We test our approach on different publicly-available LLMs, namely, OpenAI ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and Microsoft CoPilot. We provide a description of two applications-a security-sensitive Banking application employing RBAC and an RBAC API module itself-, the corresponding JML specifications, as well as a description of the prompts, the generated code, the verification results, as well as a series of interesting insights for practitioners interested in further exploring the use of LLMs for securely constructing applications.},

We then revisit human augmentation as an alternative to user friendliness that seems particularly relevant in the areas of inclusive design and artificial intelligence. Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.},

This study explores the potential applications of AI in practical teaching, particularly in multi-camera switching, real-time image processing, and automated editing. In parallel, the evolution of online live broadcasting, accelerated by post-pandemic media dynamics and heightened viewer expectations, necessitates a sophisticated skill set for TV directors. As crucial figures in live broadcasts, TV directors must navigate these technological advancements and the changing aesthetic landscape.

abstract = {Biased information (recently termed bisinformation) continues to be taught in medical curricula, often long after having been debunked. In this paper, we introduce Bricc, a first-in-class initiative that seeks to mitigate medical bisinformation using machine learning to systematically identify and flag text with potential biases, for subsequent review in an expert-in-the-loop fashion, thus greatly accelerating an otherwise labor-intensive process. We have developed a goldstandard Bricc dataset throughout several years containing over 12K pages of instructional materials. Medical experts meticulously annotated these documents for bias according to comprehensive coding guidelines, emphasizing gender, sex, age, geography, ethnicity, and race. Using this labeled dataset, we trained, validated, and tested medical bias classifiers. We test three classifier approaches: a binary type-specific classifier, a general bias classifier; an ensemble combining bias type-specific classifiers independently-trained; and a multitask learning (MTL) model tasked with predicting both general and type-specific biases. While MTL led to some improvement on race bias detection in terms of F1-score, it did not outperform binary classifiers trained specifically on each task. On general bias detection, the binary classifier achieves up to 0.923 of AUC, a 27.8% improvement over the baseline. This work lays the foundations for debiasing medical curricula by exploring a novel dataset and evaluating different training model strategies. Hence, it offers new pathways for more nuanced and effective mitigation of bisinformation.},

For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the e-learning platforms. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between any pair of robots was calculated for each platform. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all platforms. Finally, a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each of the six dimensions between all the three robots across all the e-learning platforms. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots accorded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the platforms and whether there was consistency between the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the platforms. Among some auxiliary results, it was found that the evaluation by the three robots was severely inconsistent for the two dimensions cost and security, inconsistent to a lesser extent for the dimension scalability, and consistent for the remaining three dimensions.},

abstract = {Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach. Finally, we present a practical strategy to manage the enrollment of users in such a proposed system.},

abstract = {Strategic Decision-Making is always challenging because it is inherently uncertain, ambiguous, risky, and complex. By contrast to tactical and operational decisions, strategic decisions are decisive, pivotal, and often irreversible, which may result in long-term and significant consequences. A strategic decision-making process usually involves many aspects of inquiry, including sensory perception, deliberative thinking, inquiry-based analysis, meta-learning, and constant interaction with the external world. Many unknowns, unpredictabilities, and environmental constraints will shape every aspect of a strategic decision. Traditionally, this task often relies on intuition, reflective thinking, visionary insights, approximate estimates, and practical wisdom. With recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) technologies, we can leverage AI/ML to support strategic decision-making. However, there is still a substantial gap from an AI perspective due to inadequate models, despite the tremendous progress made. We argue that creating a comprehensive taxonomy of decision frames as a representation space is essential for AI because it could offer surprising insights beyond anyone's imaginary boundary today. Strategic decision-making is the art of possibility. This study develops a systematic taxonomy of decision-making frames that consists of six bases, 18 categorical, and 54 elementary frames. We formulate the model using the inquiry method based on Bloom's taxonomy approach. We aim to lay out the computational foundation that is possible to capture a comprehensive landscape view of a strategic problem. Compared with many traditional models, this novel taxonomy covers irrational, non-rational and rational frames capable of dealing with certainty, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity, chaos, and ignorance.},

abstract = {Recently, consumer demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications using deep neural network (DNN) model such as large language model (LLM), miXed Reality (XR), and AI assistants has been steadily increasing. Hitherto, on-device AI and offloaded analytics with the help of mobile edge computing (MEC) have been extensively studied to realize AI services on top of mobile devices. However, both technologies suffer from the limited resources of mobile devices, such as thermal resilience, battery capacity, and memory size. To tackle this problem, we first extensively examine the impact of heat and memory constraints of a mobile device when networking and processing resources and multi-dimensional DNN model sizes are dynamically managed for AI applications via motivating measurement. From the experimental results, we conjecture that the threshold-based approach for joint consideration of heat and memory constraints would increase the performance of AI applications in terms of energy, frames per second (FPS), and inference accuracy. Hence, we propose a threshold-based H&amp;M algorithm that jointly adjusts offloading, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), and DNN model size, aiming to maximize inference accuracy while keeping target FPS with memory and heat constraints in various environments. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme on a mobile device and an MEC server and evaluate its performance and adaptability via extensive experiments.},

The combination of drones and autonomous wheelchairs provides an innovative solution for enhancing mobility and independence of motion-impaired people. However, safety is a critical concern when deploying such systems in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, probabilistic models can be used to capture uncertainty and non-stationarity in the environment and sensory system, enabling the device to make informed decisions while ensuring safe autonomy. The approach is being developed in the context of a recently started European project named REXASI-PRO, which addresses the modelling methodology, tools, reference architecture, design and implementation guidelines. In the project, relevant indoor and outdoor navigation use cases are addressed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing trustworthy autonomous wheelchairs in real-world environments.},

Since then, the evolution of human civilization has been initiated, with curiosity driving science and the desire for control driving technology. The development of science and technology has unfolded in two dimensions of outward and inward, the outward from the solar system, the galaxy to the universe; the inward pointing to human itself, from the movement of life to the movement of consciousness, giving rise to artificial intelligence (AI). For the first time, the "human-like" nature of AI has shaken the social activity in which the world is the stage and humans are the main actors, leading to the ethical issues of AI, of course, including the ethical issues of AI in education(AIEd). The ethical issue of AIEd is the problem caused by the transformation of the actors by implanting humanoids into the human educational community. The main issues include the ethical problem of AI, the adaption of new human and new norms of human behaviors, and the stage for the activities of the actors—the field of AIEd. The regulations of ethical issues of AIEd should aim at the pursuit of human well-being and focus on practice, mainly from the aspects of customs transfer, norms construction and legislation constraints.},

This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students’ experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields.

abstract = {The implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, and academic research has generated considerable discussion and debate. Currently, AI systems attempt to address student learning by helping with obstacle alleviation that students face. With a full grasp of the technical systems involved, students ensure the optimal utilization of AI-assisted personalized learning. However, despite numerous empirical studies on its functionality and capabilities, there is a lack of understanding about AI's place in providing a personalized learning environment while assisting students, especially in the Philippines. This review aims to explore literature regarding the incorporation of AI systems for personalized learning that can be used by Senior High School (SHS) students, specifically in the Philippines. A multi-phase approach was employed, starting with a systematic literature review based on the PRISMA method, carried out in three phases to explore AI-assisted personalized learning's implementation, benefits, and challenges. Data from N=34 studies published from 2019 to 2024 were gathered and analyzed to explore the feasibility and impact of AI-assisted personalized learning. Overall findings show the positive impact of AI-assisted personalized learning, emphasizing improved learning outcomes and student motivation in various nations especially in Asia, Africa, and North America. Our findings show that AI personal learning systems, while promising, face challenges such as the need for empathetic AI systems, comprehensive teacher training, and underscores areas for further research and consideration to realize the full potential of AI personalized learning interventions.},

abstract = {Research on Extended Reality (XR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is booming, which has led to an emerging body of literature in their intersection. However, the main topics in this intersection are unclear, as are the benefits of combining XR and AI. This paper presents a scoping review that highlights how XR is applied in AI research and vice versa. We screened 2619 publications from 203 international venues published between 2017 and 2021, followed by an in-depth review of 311 papers. Based on our review, we identify five main topics at the intersection of XR and AI, showing how research at the intersection can benefit each other. Furthermore, we present a list of commonly used datasets, software, libraries, and models to help researchers interested in this intersection. Finally, we present 13 research opportunities and recommendations for future work in XR and AI research.},

abstract = {The advent of Artificial Intelligence-generated Content(AIGC) has revolutionized the traditional creative activities in the design field, the workflow of which includes idea generation, sketching, solution determination, low-fidelity prototype interaction, detail tuning, high-fidelity prototyping, front-end slicing, and deployment. By contrast, AIGC streamlines the process of design into idea generation, design model prompting, image dataset collection, AIGC tool use, model fine-tuning, and tool optimization. The designer's focus, the subject, and the object of attention have been changed accordingly. Traditional design activities without AIGC focus on realizing individual and team creativity; the ones with AIGC introduce AI models, algorithms, and AI-HMIs as collaborators in the creative process. The quality of the created content is no longer determined by the designer alone due to the involvement of Artificial Intelligence(AI) of in the prediction and decision-making of the created content. There is also a growing need for designers to have a self-explanatory and responsible intelligent system. This study investigates the role of explainability in four AIGC tools and its impact on creative design. It aims to assess how explainability influences user satisfaction and computer vision metrics in the context of style transfer for iOS mobile interface design. The results demonstrate the adaptations and limitations of these AIGC tools. As observed in CycleGAN, a high level of explainability involves various factors, including superior model performance, manageable datasets, extensive fine-tuning of model parameters, user-centered human-computer interaction, explainability results presentation, and input methods. This high degree of explainability leads to the highest levels of user satisfaction and computer vision evaluation. However, it has drawbacks, as it has limited control over design details.AIGC tools with a medium level of explainability, such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, rely on text-to-image cues for user interaction. They scored in the medium range for user satisfaction and computer vision evaluation. These tools rely on system scalability and functional control for explainability. In contrast, the low level of explainability of "Sense of Everything" stems from single dataset control and simple user interaction. As a result, it scored low on user satisfaction and computer vision assessments, indicating a need for more controllability and poor-quality content generation. The study also analyzes the impact of computer vision assessment metrics, where SSIM aligns more with users' subjective evaluations than VGG19. The study highlights areas for improving explainability to meet user expectations for higher performance and ease of use of AIGC tools.},

In order to enhance the learning quality and experience of students, it is important to develop an effective instructional design, particularly in defining the goals and strategies, solving individual needs, and enhancing learning performance. However, the impact of implementing GAI in student learning and performance enhancement considerations is still lacking. Therefore, this study proposes an experimental framework for evaluating the effectiveness of GAI-based learning for students. By scrutinizing instructional goals and design strategies to achieve desirable learning outcomes, it provides guidelines on coverage design and development in GAI-based learning environments. Experiment with case studies on supply chain and cold chain management is adopted to analyze the effectiveness and facilitate instructional design in GAI-based learning to enhance the student learning experience. The result indicates that the treatment group outperformed the control group. This study is expected to provide insights into academic development and future education on GAI-based learning.},

abstract = {Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain (BCT), and the Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to accelerate the economic transformation of developing countries. Most developed economies are already taking initiatives for “responsible” implementation of these technologies, such as capacity development, infrastructure enhancement, and establishing governance standards. Similar initiatives in Africa are little known. The literature highlights the potential and opportunities/challenges of implementing emerging technologies. However, the research rarely addresses how to implement such technologies in Africa for sustainable development, and the associated challenges often lead to abandoned solutions in the early stages. This paper explores the application of emerging technologies in Africa to determine the challenges associated with the implementation and derive recommendations for responsible designs. We used the PESTEL-O framework to categorise the identified challenges and risks. The findings reveal a status quo in adopting emerging technology in Africa and provide recommendations for a responsible design of such solutions.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) to handle the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.},

That is, the only way of changing their internal data models is to retrain these models using different inputs. This is ineffective in dynamic systems that are prone to changes, like concept drift. A new promising solution is transparent artificial intelligence, based on the notions of interpretation and explanation, whose objective is to correlate the internal data models with predictions. The research question being addressed is whether we can have a self-adaptive machine learning system that is able to interpret and explain its data model in order for it to be controlled.

We follow this with outlining what we consider to be the typical steps for developing an AI-based technology, which we've broken down into 6 stages: identifying a problem, development process and management tool selection, dataset development and data processing, model development, deployment and risk assessment, and integration and monitoring. The goal of this paper is to better understand how Wynter's biocentric Man is being represented and reinforced by the technologies we are producing in the AI lifecycle and by the lifecycle itself; we hope to identify ways in which the distinction of Blackness from the ‘ideal’ human leads to perpetual punishment at the hands of these technologies. By deconstructing this development process, we can potentially identify ways in which humans in general have not been prioritized and how those affects are disproportionately affecting marginalized people. We hope to offer solutions that will encourage changes in the AI development cycle.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence is driving new industrial solutions for challenging problems once considered impossible. Many large-scale companies use AI to identify opportunities to improve business processes and products. Despite the promise and perils of AI, many traditional software systems (e.g., taxation or reporting) are implemented without AI in mind. Adopting AI-based capabilities in such software can be challenging due to a lack of resources and uncertainties in requirements. This paper documents our experience working with our industry partner on adopting AI capabilities in enterprise software. The enterprise software receives and processes thousands of user inputs with different configuration settings daily, which makes manual user input verification infeasible. To assist our industry partner, we design and integrate an AI-based input verification framework into the software. However, during the design and integration of the framework, we encounter many challenges that range from the requirement engineering process to the development, adoption, and verification process. We discuss the challenges we encountered and their corresponding solutions while working with our industrial partner to integrate the AI-based input verification framework into their non-AI software. Our experience report may provide valuable insight to practitioners and researchers on better integrating AI-based capabilities with existing software systems.},

abstract = {Medical progress notes have recently become available to patients at an unprecedented scale. Progress notes offer patients insight into their care that they cannot find elsewhere. That said, reading a note requires patients to contend with the language, unspoken assumptions, and clutter common to clinical documentation. As the health system reinvents many of its interfaces to incorporate AI assistance, this paper examines what intelligent interfaces could do to help patients read their progress notes. In a qualitative study, we examine the needs of patients as they read a progress note. We then formulate a vision for the explainable note, an augmented progress note that provides support for directing attention, phrase-level understanding, and tracing lines of reasoning. This vision manifests in a set of patient-inspired opportunities for advancing intelligent interfaces for writing and reading progress notes.},

abstract = {From the creation of writing robot by Tencent Finance in 2015 to the "Creative Brain" published by People's Daily in 2020, the model of "Artificial Intelligence + News Production" has entered most mainstream media in China. This paper studies the use of artificial intelligence in news production, focusing on three aspects of robot writing, AI virtual news anchor and news distribution system, in order to observe the application of artificial intelligence in Chinese news media. The investigation found that the application of artificial intelligence in Chinese news media started late and lacked intelligence. The development of artificial intelligence was restricted due to the limitation of Chinese language and the inconsistency of technical standards. However, the Chinese news media has high acceptance of artificial intelligence, and has also creatively developed news products such as AI virtual anchor, which will develop rapidly in the future under the push of policy and market in the news field.},

abstract = {In the process of oral English learning, oral assessment can make students understand their oral problems and correct them. The traditional manual assessment is low in efficiency, high in cost, and has many limitations. However, the automatic assessment of spoken English can be realized with the help of artificial intelligence technology, which is an important reform direction for the future oral English teaching and evaluation. This article introduces the principle of automatic oral English assessment based on artificial intelligence technology, and discusses the feasibility of using artificial intelligence technology to partially replace manual scoring in oral English assessment, exploring the way to improve the stability and objectivity of assessment by using artificial intelligence technology, discussing the application of artificial intelligence technology in oral English autonomous learning, and also putting forward some suggestions on how to further improve the accuracy of artificial intelligence scoring in oral English assessment.},

It starts by outlining the potential consequences of AI-assisted cheating, including the risks posed to education quality, fairness, and the credibility of academic institutions. After reviewing an array of strategies reported in the literature to counteract such cheating, this paper calls for rigorous research to assess the effectiveness of those strategies. It further suggests a range of research topics in detecting AI-generated content and highlights a promising research direction focusing on motivating students’ interest in learning through innovative AI applications that divert their efforts away from misuse of technology. Lastly, the paper suggests that addressing AI cheating requires ethical education, academia-industry collaboration, integration into AI ethics, and an international consortium. One of the unique contributions of this paper is outlining a range of potential research directions, both technical and non-technical, in this area where AI meets AI.},

Although AI has the ability to provide individualized learning experiences, there are unknowns when it comes to data that is outside of its training set. The review highlights the need for more thorough research by exposing a lack of high-quality evidence on the results of AI integration. While AI is recognized for its ability to track student progress and provide feedback, the effectiveness of these efforts depends on the choice of suitable AI-driven learning models.

abstract = {Since the concept of "artificial intelligence" was put forward in 1956, it has been very successful both in application and promotion, and gradually changed its name to engineering technology. So far, it has been used for automatic translation, remote control, robot design and manufacturing, language and image analysis, genetic programming, automated factories, automated programming, aviation and aerospace applications, a large amount of information processing, information storage. The management and execution of complex or large-scale tasks that the human body can complete has great research value for artificial intelligence in these areas. The purpose of this article is to study the construction of a mechanical control system based on artificial intelligence technology. In this document, the motion and rotation equation models of the robotic arm are defined. According to the case in the report, calculate the maximum torque that each arm joint can bear, and use the calculated specific data parameters in the experiment and compare it in the literature. The experimental results are compared with the experimental results of this article. Through the research of the engine control system, based on a large amount of research and practice, this paper examines the threats and loopholes of the system in detail, and designs a system based on WINdow7. This paper uses the data obtained in the actual evaluation and practice of the system and the calculation results of the actual operation method to verify the rationality, feasibility and value of the artificial intelligence-based mechanical operating system. Experimental research shows that based on the artificial intelligence technology proposed in this paper, the specific rotation value of each joint is determined to be as high as 300 degrees through actual observation and practice. The data and the related formulas are calculated, and the results obtained are more reliable and true. It proved the feasibility and value of the mechanical control system specified in this article.},

abstract = {The software engineering industry is an everchanging domain requiring professionals to have a good knowledge base and adaptability skills.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved substantial success in enhancing program analysis techniques and applications, including bug prediction. It is a promising direction by applying advanced Machine Learning techniques into suitable software engineering tasks.  

The main goal of this paper is to propose a pedagogical interdisciplinary approach that pave the path for developing an e-learning platform serving to check the quality of the source code that students wrote by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. By putting into practice this proposal, we are planning to show the students how to combine concepts learned from two different courses. The first step of this approach would be part of the Advanced Programming Methods, a Software Engineering related course, where students learn about the importance of writing good quality code and use software metrics as a mean of software quality assessment. Then, the following steps will be integrated into the Artificial Intelligence course, where students learn about different Machine Learning algorithms and how to apply them to solve practical problems. Thus, as an applicability in this respect, students use the metric values calculated for their projects developed at Advanced Programming Methods course as lab assignments and also to train (at Artificial Intelligence class) a bug detection model able to estimate the quality of new codebases.  

The proposed approach is helpful for both students and teachers. On one side, it helps the students understand the importance of writing clean, high-quality code. And on the other side, it helps teachers in their evaluation process by giving them time to focus on different aspects of homework than the code quality.},

abstract = {Objectives. This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies.Participants. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article.Study Method. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers’ readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers’ self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach.Findings. This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers’ self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers’ self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers’ own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum.Conclusions. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government’s teacher training initiatives.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI, including through their work, advocacy, and choice of employment. Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace et al., 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang &amp; Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

Within this dissertation, I aim to explore the potential of adaptive argumentation skill learning based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) by designing, implementing, and evaluating new technology-enhanced pedagogical concepts to actively support students in developing the ability to argue in a structured, logical, and reflective way. I develop new student-centered pedagogical scenarios with empirically evaluated design principles, linguistic corpora, ML algorithms, and innovative learning tools based on an adaptive writing support system and a pedagogical conversational agent. My results indicate that adaptive learning tools based on ML algorithms and user-centered design patterns help students to develop better argumentation writing skills. Thereby, I contribute to research by bridging the boundaries of argumentation learning and argumentation mining and by examining pedagogical scenarios for adaptive argumentation learning from a user-centered perspective.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly used in several fields to improve performance and the level of automation. In recent years, this use has exponentially increased due to the advancement of high-performance computing and the ever increasing size of data. One of such fields is that of hardware design—specifically the design of digital and analog integrated circuits, where AI/ ML techniques have been extensively used to address ever-increasing design complexity, aggressive time to market, and the growing number of ubiquitous interconnected devices. However, the security concerns and issues related to integrated circuit design have been highly overlooked. In this article, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AI/ML for circuit design/optimization, security and engineering challenges, research in security-aware computer-aided design/electronic design automation, and future research directions and needs for using AI/ML for security-aware circuit design.},

abstract = {This study focuses on exploring the key factors influencing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) by university teachers in the context of digital education, particularly in the backdrop of human-computer interaction. Considering the challenges posed by small-sample data, we employed various machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression (SVR), and optimized model parameters through grid search and cross-validation techniques. The optimized models exhibited significantly improved performance, with the linear regression model showing a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.1239 and an R² score of 0.6362, indicating its good predictive accuracy and generalization ability on the small-sample dataset. The study results emphasize performance expectations, perceived value, and community influence as primary influencing factors for university teachers' use of generative AI, especially in the context of human-computer interaction. This is crucial for understanding and promoting the acceptance and use of educational technology. This research provides valuable insights for education policymakers and technology developers and offers important methodological guidance for machine learning applications dealing with small-sample data.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which "intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity" [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey.},

The IoT are widely used in numerous sectors including medical services and have become the rise of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). One of the implementations is the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Previously the health records were used in traditional manner such as print-out health record of a patient and stored to an archive room. With the innovation of EHR, patients’ health records are digitalized which provides advantages from space efficiency and paperless forms. EHR helps medical service management to provide better healthcare services. With the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analysis in EHR, healthcare services provide more accurate and reliable diagnosis.},

However, not everyone understands how these technologies work. There are many misconceptions surrounding what they can and cannot do, and what are the risks and benefits. Thus, there is a need to educate the general public about everyday AI, upscaling their algorithmic literacy and helping them become more informed, responsible users. We describe the development and evaluation of an eight-week course open to the public, AI in Everyday Life. Pre- and post-course questionnaires were used to evaluate the impact of the course and participants' attitudes towards AI applications. The results suggest that more targeted educational approaches are needed for the general public to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of the use of AI-enabled technologies.},

abstract = {The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.},

Whether an enterprise chooses to advance or be eliminated depends on whether the enterprise can break the old management model and complete digital transformation. Therefore, based on the review of the concept and development of AI, this article analyzes the positive impacts of AI on the functional modules of HRM, such as improving the quality of employee recruitment, optimizing the allocation of human resources, etc., and a series of ethical issues such as information leakage and technical unemployment caused by AI. Finally, we construct a four-stage model of HRM reform in the era of AI and propose a series of targeted strategies to achieve the coordinated development of HRM and AI.

There are nearly 50 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease, and that number is expected to exceed 130 million by 2050, according to the International Dementia Association. Lack of engagement in mental and physical activities will lead to cognitive decline and various health problems in older adults. To address these challenges, this study proposes the use of an artificial intelligence model to develop a personalized game that analyzes users' activity data and provides timely feedback on appropriate health-promoting activities. By following the suggestions provided by the game, users can engage in health-promoting activities that are appropriate to their needs, ensuring that the intensity of the activity is not too high or too low. The artificial intelligence dynamically adjusts the game content according to the user's current state to achieve a progressive and targeted health promotion effect. The experimental results show that the system developed in this study is effective in promoting the health of the elderly.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of society, the energy consumption of buildings in our country is also growing. Excessive energy consumption will lead to environmental problems such as the increase of greenhouse gas emissions, so it is necessary to promote building energy conservation and emission reduction to reduce the problem of excessive energy consumption. The key to building energy conservation and emission reduction is to predict the future trend of building energy consumption and achieve accurate prediction of building energy consumption, which can assist in guiding building energy conservation planning and energy use strategies. However, the existing building energy consumption forecasting methods are difficult to model the highly complex and nonlinear building energy consumption data, and it is difficult to capture the time-dependent relationship of energy consumption data. For the non-stationary and mutational multi-variable building energy consumption series, how to consider the relationship between each variable on energy consumption and capture the abrupt trend of energy consumption data is still a major challenge in building energy consumption prediction. Therefore, this paper will use neural network to study the above problems. In view of the characteristics that building energy consumption is affected by various factors and building energy consumption data is highly complex, this paper proposes a building energy consumption prediction model based on neural network, and uses the antagonistic mechanism of neural network to learn the hidden layer relationship between building energy consumption and its influencing factors. By designing suitable objective function and network structure for the neural network, the neural network is applied to the prediction of building energy consumption, and the experimental results show that the prediction performance is good.},

abstract = {Deep learning models for learning analytics have become increasingly popular over the last few years; however, these approaches are still not widely adopted in real-world settings, likely due to a lack of trust and transparency. In this paper, we tackle this issue by implementing explainable AI methods for black-box neural networks. This work focuses on the context of online and blended learning and the use case of student success prediction models. We use a pairwise study design, enabling us to investigate controlled differences between pairs of courses. Our analyses cover five course pairs that differ in one educationally relevant aspect and two popular instance-based explainable AI methods (LIME and SHAP). We quantitatively compare the distances between the explanations across courses and methods. We then validate the explanations of LIME and SHAP with 26 semi-structured interviews of university-level educators regarding which features they believe contribute most to student success, which explanations they trust most, and how they could transform these insights into actionable course design decisions. Our results show that quantitatively, explainers significantly disagree with each other about what is important, and qualitatively, experts themselves do not agree on which explanations are most trustworthy. All code, extended results, and the interview protocol are provided at https://github.com/epfl-ml4ed/trusting-explainers.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and its sub-disciplines are becoming increasingly relevant in numerous areas of academia as well as industry and can now be considered a core area of Computer Science [84]. The Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge. We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions, with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This article shares the insights from both students and lecturers with experience in the field of AI and machine learning education, with the aim to inform prospective pedagogies and studies within this domain and move toward a framework for best practice in teaching and learning of these topics.},

abstract = {In this knowledge-based society, the increasing need of gaining knowledge has forced universities into the effective adaptation of distance learning technologies in their educational program so that they can satisfy a huge number of students who prefer to attend in distance learning mode. Advances in artificial intelligence technologies have also contributed to the development of distance learning programs as support tools in teaching and learning processes, closing the educational and organizational gap between students and teachers such as performing time-intensive tasks, providing constant feedback, and reducing disqualifications and dropouts in distance learning courses. In this contribution, this paper presents the state-of-the-art applications of artificial intelligence in distance education by using a systematic mapping approach that aims to identify, analyze, and classify the relevant literature about different artificial intelligence technologies applied in distance education environments. Based on research questions, and search and selection strategies, 60 candidate studies are identified and retrieved from four academic repositories. Afterward, they are further filtered through selection criteria and discussed to reach a consensus, leading to exclusion of 23 documents. The resulting 37 studies constitute the final pool of key publications that are classified and analyzed to build content taxonomy and provide the state of the art in artificial intelligence-supported remote education. This paper also identified research interest clusters with highlights for the term analysis of the textual &amp; behavioral patterns of students, face recognition, and emotion recognition. The study concludes the paper with implications, limitations of the study, and future research agenda.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs. We conclude this article with an introduction of the articles included in this special issue.},

The survey was addressed at practitioners of public administrations at central, regional, and local level and aimed to compile a collection of cases of AI-enabled solutions used by public sector administrations. It analyses the drivers, obstacles, opportunities, and influencing factors of AI adoption and use by European public sector administrations, and identifies the perceived impacts of AI-enabled solutions on the different beneficiaries/users of services provided by public sector administrations. Findings from 62 respondents show that there is a wide array of AI initiatives in the public sector in European Member States moving beyond the pilot stage, that there is lack of citizen involvement in the design of AI services, low digital literacy of employees using AI systems, and that the disrupting effect that AI is expected to have in the public sector is still not mirrored in concrete large-scale AI projects with wide impact on public affairs.},

abstract = {Recently, scholars across disciplines raised questions and concerns about the notion of human intervention [1], control, and oversight over AI systems [2]. This observation becomes particularly important in the age of ubiquitous computing and the increasing adoption of AI in everyday technological infrastructure. This paper proposes a conceptual interpretation and future research agenda for the concept of human agency in times of ubiquitous AI. Building on Nicholas Garnham's theoretical framework in 2000 [3], this paper explains the concept of mediation through human agents, technological tools and systems of symbolic representation. As AI-enabled mediation becomes ever more prominent in different sectors, this paper reconsiders Garnham's mediation framework and the role of human agents in 2020, twenty years ahead. This paper proposes distinguishing between passive and active human agency and calls for theoretical and empirical research on individual AI redress. Ultimately, this paper argues to empower active human agency in times of ubiquitous AI},

abstract = {Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated/human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.},

abstract = {Starting from the concepts of artificial intelligence and management accounting, this paper analyzes the application of artificial intelligence technology in management accounting, expounds the past and present life of intelligent accounting, and constructs the framework of intelligent accounting system. Human society is unprecedented in two worlds at the same time: the real world and the virtual (digital) world. In the past, accounting was basically a mirror system that reflected objective things with information. It was a monetization mapping of economic activities in the real world, that is, using information system to project the real world. The future intelligent accounting is a cognitive system based on computing power, algorithm and data, which is embedded in the real and virtual world and integrated with this digital virtual world, harmonious symbiosis and resonance with the same frequency. Through the high-level grafting and integration of accounting rules and emerging technologies, that is, the seamless connection between "borrowing" and "lending" accounting language and computer coding language, it realizes the digital substitution of business activities or transactions in the macro and micro economic and social fields of the real and virtual world. On this basis, based on accounting Big data or full sample data integrated in real time by business, industry or social information, using big data technology and intelligent decision-making tools, provide information services for value feedback and value creation of macro and micro economic subjects. Therefore, intelligent accounting is essentially a basic management activity, which plays the role of big data analysis and auxiliary decision support. It belongs to the interdisciplinary category and has the attribute of computational social science.},

abstract = {There is an enormous disadvantage for students who, due to different situations, have decided to return to higher education after a prolonged period of time, in the face of an educational system designed for optimal conditions for students. The disadvantage deepens when already in their adult stage, the time for academic dedication decreases due to their work occupations. This proposal aims to adapt the pedagogical model to their needs, specific needs in logic and mathematical operability, time, mobility, and location. Achieving this requires the design of a hybrid application based primarily on artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeking to achieve the adaptation to the student through the correct training of neural networks, resulting in the identification of the specific requirements of each user and the selection and application of strategies, teaching techniques and content of the mathematics program to be learned and apprehended by the person who must remedy the shortcomings caused by the cessation and in many cases by a poor academic process. The following is a tour through the different aspects that support the proposal; from the need presented by students with academic cessation to the approach of a technological and specific solution for each individual starting from the generality of the causes to the possibility of giving a unique result thanks to the developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have transformed digital banking by offering services such as personalized recommendations and interactive chatbots. However, only some AI systems target older adult users, given their relatively low usage of digital banking. Conversely, older adults may benefit the most from AI as handling finances becomes increasingly crucial after retirement. Our paper aims to fill this gap by 1) understanding the everyday financial concerns of older adults near retirement age and 2) exploring interests and needs in AI supporting their financial concerns. To understand the perspectives of older adults regarding the support of financial needs with AI, we conducted co-design workshops with 14 older adults. Our findings revealed three key concerns: retirement planning, grown children’s education and marriage expenses, and family healthcare costs. Also, participants were willing to use AI to glean the financial information they lacked and grow self-efficacy. Finally, we discuss the design opportunities of using AI to support older adults’ financial decisions.},

abstract = {Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI advocate for AI technology that is, among other things, more inclusive. Explainable AI (XAI) aims at making state of the art opaque models more transparent, and defends AI-based outcomes endorsed with a rationale explanation, i.e., an explanation that has as target the non-technical users. XAI and Responsible AI principles defend the fact that the audience expertise should be included in the evaluation of explainable AI systems. However, AI has not yet reached all public and audiences, some of which may need it the most. One example of domain where accessibility has not much been influenced by the latest AI advances is cultural heritage. We propose including minorities as special user and evaluator of the latest XAI techniques. In order to define catalytic scenarios for collaboration and improved user experience, we pose some challenges and research questions yet to address by the latest AI models likely to be involved in such synergy.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced more than 60 years of development and accumulated a strong technical foundation. In the past ten years, AI has gone through computational intelligence and perceptual intelligence, and is rapidly moving towards cognitive intelligence. AI has stepped from the 1.0 era, which is only recognized and used by elite minority groups, to the 2.0 era, which is widely used by all walks of life. With the rapid development and application of natural language understanding, facial expression recognition, educational data, virtual reality and robotics, the new intelligent teaching system after introducing these technologies is carrying out intelligent transformation and reconstruction of knowledge representation and learning process, and capturing and perceiving and analyzing learners' knowledge in real time. Learning state, automatic assessment, learning analysis, emotional perception, simulation teaching and intelligent companionship become the proper functions of intelligent teaching system. AI 2.0 will bring about great changes in the field of education. Teaching and learning are undergoing a series of changes, ranging from the generation and flow of knowledge, the form and interaction of learning, the form and construction of learning resources, the organization and implementation of teaching content, expert system, ubiquitous learning to the evaluation and management of teaching performance.},

abstract = {A learning strategy that involves students in the construction of knowledge is the peer assessment, which allows the development of abilities in the base of the rubrics. This research developed a literature review of using artificial intelligence - AI techniques in the processes of selection and design of rubrics in the context of learning evaluation. The classification of information has considered the electronic databases, using the Zott's focus as the research methodology. The preliminary results prove that there are different manners of rubrics designs. These results reveal that the use of rubrics in the peer assessment processes is strongly related to technology involved within AI for support in a better way the teaching-learning processes. The outcomes presented in this paper could become a reference framework for scholars in order to support their rubrics design with AI techniques.

This article mainly studies the application of artificial intelligence technology in the video production of the course "Horse Anatomy and Physiology". The questionnaire is mainly distributed on the spot. In order to further investigate students’ views on the application of artificial intelligence technology in the video production of the "Horse Anatomy and Physiology" course, the corresponding interview outline is designed, mainly from "students' understanding of this course" and "students' acceptance of the course content" Interviews and exchanges from multiple aspects and perspectives such as "students' teaching methods for courses". And take notes, according to the feedback from the students, make corresponding adjustments to the content and teaching methods of the course. Regarding extended resources, on the whole, 72.5% of learners participated in the learning of extended resources, and 81.2% of learners hope to obtain some knowledge that is not in the book through extended resources, but only 32.5% of learners think that the extension in the course resources are helpful to learning. It can be seen that the course needs to be improved in terms of expanding resources. The resources should be enriched and novel to meet the needs of learners. The results show that artificial intelligence technology has a certain promoting effect on the engineering of "Horse Anatomy and Physiology" course video production.},

A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.},

abstract = {The rising adoption of learning analytics and academic performance prediction technologies in higher education highlights the urgent need for transparency and explainability. This demand, rooted in ethical concerns and fairness considerations, converges with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) principles. Despite the recognized importance of transparency and fairness in learning analytics, empirical studies examining student fairness perceptions, particularly within academic performance prediction, remain limited. We conducted a pre-registered factorial survey experiment involving 1,047 German students to investigate how decision tree features (simplicity and accuracy) influence perceived distributive and informational fairness, mediated by causability (i.e., the self-assessed understandability of a machine learning model’s cause-effect linkages). Additionally, we examined the moderating role of institutional trust in these relationships. Our results indicate that decision tree simplicity positively affects fairness perceptions, mediated by causability. In contrast, prediction accuracy neither directly nor indirectly influences these perceptions. Even if the hypothesized effects of interest are either minor or non-existent, results show that the medium positive effect of causability on the distributive fairness assessment depends on institutional trust. These findings substantially impact the crafting of transparent machine learning models in educational settings. We discuss important implications for fairness and transparency in implementing academic performance prediction systems.},

The literature on polyp detection shows widely varying miss rates among clinicians, with averages ranging around 22%--27%. While recent work has considered the use of AI support systems for polyp detection, how to visualise and integrate these systems into clinical practice is an open question. In this work, we explore the design of visual markers as used in an AI support system for colonoscopy. Supported by the gastroenterologists in our team, we designed seven unique visual markers and rendered them on real-life patient video footage. Through an online survey targeting relevant clinical staff (N = 36), we evaluated these designs and obtained initial insights and understanding into the way in which clinical staff envision AI to integrate in their daily work-environment. Our results provide concrete recommendations for the future deployment of AI support systems in continuous, adaptive scenarios.},

abstract = {We argue that the phenomena of distributed responsibility, induced acceptance, and acceptance through ignorance constitute instances of imperfect delegation when tasks are delegated to computationally-driven systems. Imperfect delegation challenges human accountability. We hold that both direct public accountability via public transparency and indirect public accountability via transparency to auditors in public organizations can be both instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and conclude that while some guidelines refer processes that amount to auditing, it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of the entitlement of auditors and the goals of auditing, also in order to develop ethically meaningful standards with respect to which different forms of auditing can be evaluated and compared.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are making remarkable achievements even in creative fields such as aesthetics. However, whether those outside the machine learning (ML) community can sufficiently interpret or agree with their results, especially in such highly subjective domains, is being questioned. In this paper, we try to understand how different user communities reason about AI algorithm results in subjective domains. We designed AI Mirror, a research probe that tells users the algorithmically predicted aesthetic scores of photographs. We conducted a user study of the system with 18 participants from three different groups: AI/ML experts, domain experts (photographers), and general public members. They performed tasks consisting of taking photos and reasoning about AI Mirror's prediction algorithm with think-aloud sessions, surveys, and interviews. The results showed the following: (1) Users understood the AI using their own group-specific expertise; (2) Users employed various strategies to close the gap between their judgments and AI predictions overtime; (3) The difference between users' thoughts and AI pre-dictions was negatively related with users' perceptions of the AI's interpretability and reasonability. We also discuss design considerations for AI-infused systems in subjective domains.},

abstract = {Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has enhanced students’ learning especially by personalizing content to students’ individual needs and automating the learning process. However, AI has also raised serious privacy issues which hindered the adoption of the technology. Therefore, this research was an attempt to contribute towards attaining the goal of investigating the above problem in terms of students’ class engagement in various online learning contexts. A quantitative (quasi-experimental design) study with pre-test and post-test was conducted, and data were collected from 99 postgraduate students from the same local university in Hong Kong. The 99 students were divided into three groups randomly with each group consisting of 33 students. One control group learned with traditional online learning without any AI applications, two experimental groups learned with AI applications in the class, and one with the privacy issues taken into consideration. The pre-test and post-test were conducted based on The Online Student Engagement Scale (OSE) across 4 main factors (skills, emotion, participation, and performance) to assess the students’ behavioral changes. Descriptive analysis and ANCOVA analysis were used to analyze the data. This study discovered that the students’ online learning with the AI applications applied for 4 weeks improved their class engagement, and the group with privacy consent taken into consideration exhibited a greater improvement in students’ class engagement than the groups without privacy consent when implementing the AI application for online learning. The second stage of this project has been exploring the reasons behind the research results via a qualitative approach (interviews). Further content analysis was recommended to investigate this issue deeper.},

We describe AI development as an “unknown unknown” problem where both business needs and AI models evolve over time. We describe a holistic view of an iterative, continuous approach to develop industrial AI software basing on business goals, requirements and Minimum Viable Products. From this, five areas of challenges are presented with the focus on experimentation. In the end, we propose a research agenda with seven questions for future studies.},

So that it can give full play to its ability in the fierce market competition and achieve the best economic benefits. Robots have some sensory functions, such as sense of touch, smell and so on, which enable robots to process information of different signals autonomously. Inspired by the ant colony's foraging behavior of finding the shortest path, this paper proposes a simulated evolutionary algorithm artificial ant colony algorithm, which simulates the behavior of ant colony in nature. Ant colony algorithm has been concerned by many experts and scholars, and is being studied by more and more experts and scholars. The algorithm is continuously improved, and the application scope is more and more extensive. It is a bionic optimization algorithm with good development prospects. This paper mainly introduces the basic principle and basic model of ant colony algorithm. Finally, the improvement strategy of ant colony algorithm and the research and design of artificial intelligence training platform are discussed.},

This evaluation has important democratic implications but at the same time, consumes substantial human resources. However, until now the use of artificial intelligence such as computer-supported text analysis has remained an under-studied solution to this problem. We identify three generic tasks in the evaluation process that could benefit from natural language processing (NLP). Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the applicability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.},

The study analyze the inter-subjectivity concept to the model development from the conceptual level, the benchmark value of the whole setting, multidimensional spacetime, and the leading importance of the Internet governance idea to the reformation of IPE in the colleges and universities. The findings assess the issues with IPE transformation and development in colleges and universities and suggest solutions, as well as four mechanisms of "methodical design underlined in the overview, team-work cooperation of team development, augmentation of environmental development, and double endorsement of quality management”. The concept of developing a” three-stage full atmosphere" network IPE architecture for universities and colleges is presented as one of the remedies to enhance the efficiency of the IPE in universities. This idea is based on experience summary, theoretical analysis, and empirical study. The timeliness concerns of IPE transformation in universities and colleges are resolved by using in-depth comprehension and evaluation of the necessary knowledge of DM-AI, which is then used to apply the appropriate DM-AI methodologies. This allows the relevant administrators to quickly learn the crucial data in complicated problems and suggest solutions for subsequent decision-making.},

abstract = {Human emotion analysis is a very extensive research field, which can be realized by a variety of applications. To engage in any project related to emotion detection, you must collect available models, data sets, and performance statistics related to it. The purpose of this review analysis is to integrate a unique and advanced set of methods proposed and/or implemented by everyone in the field. The research work of this paper mainly focuses on two aspects of classification, one is the classification based on research objects, the other is the classification based on research methods. The research object is mainly the difference between short text and normal text. The research methods mainly focus on machine learning, such as deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). It can be seen from the comparison results that depth learning training is the best at a specific number of layers. If the number of layers is too many or too few, it will lead to insufficient accuracy or a waste of training time. Finally, this paper also puts forward feasible future research directions to provide readers with reference.},

abstract = {Integrating curriculum ideology and politics into the whole process of education and teaching is an effective way to realize the whole process of educating people in colleges and universities. We take the database management system in the university ideological and political education courses as an example, and carry out teaching reforms in response to the current mismatch in class hours, the strange phenomenon of learning style in the multimedia classroom, and the emphasis on skills over moral education in the current teaching of this course. Finally, the article integrates computer artificial intelligence technology on the basis of teaching reform, designs and develops a computer-assisted teaching system for ideological and political education based on a hybrid P2P network. The system includes functions such as discussion group, electronic whiteboard, courseware management, homework management, online examination subsystem, and teaching video-on-demand subsystem. This paper describes in detail the important links in the system development process, such as demand analysis, design and implementation, and testing. Finally, the auxiliary teaching system developed in this thesis has been successfully deployed in colleges and universities, and the operation effect is good.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of online learning, intelligent tutoring systems are regaining increased attention. In this paper, we introduce adaptive algorithms for personalized assignment of learning tasks to student so that to improve his performance in online learning environments. As main contribution of this paper, we propose a a novel Skill-Based Task Selector (SBTS) algorithm which is able to approximate a student's skill level based on his performance and consequently suggest adequate assignments. The SBTS is inspired by the class of multi-armed bandit algorithms. However, in contrast to standard multi-armed bandit approaches, the SBTS aims at acquiring two criteria related to student learning, namely: which topics should the student work on, and what level of difficulty should the task be. The SBTS centers on innovative reward and punishment schemes in a task and skill matrix based on the student behaviour.To verify the algorithm, the complex student behaviour is modelled using a neighbour node selection approach based on empirical estimations of a students learning curve. The algorithm is evaluated with a practical scenario from a basic java programming course. The SBTS is able to quickly and accurately adapt to the composite student competency --- even with a multitude of student models.},

abstract = {There has been a growing interest in HCI to understand the specific technological needs of people with dementia and supporting them in self-managing daily activities. One of the most difficult challenges to address is supporting the fluctuating accessibility needs of people with dementia, which vary with the specific type of dementia and the progression of the condition. Researchers have identified auto-personalized interfaces, and more recently, Artificial Intelligence or AI-driven personalization as a potential solution to making commercial technology accessible in a scalable manner for users with fluctuating ability. However, there is a lack of understanding on the perceptions of people with dementia around AI as an aid to their everyday technology use and its role in their overall self-management systems, which include other non-AI technology, and human assistance. In this paper, we present future directions for the design of AI-based systems to personalize an interface for dementia-related changes in different types of memory, along with expectations for AI interactions with the user with dementia.},

abstract = {Developing the problem solving skills of children is a challenging problem that is crucial for the future of our society. Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable “black-box” that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a collaborative artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik’s cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.},

Educators teach the subject to inform students about their possible advantages and risks. Recently, various resources have been designed to teach AI, however, these resources generally fail to meet an interdisciplinary approach and do not narrate the overall picture of AI development. To address this gap, we developed a 36-week open-source AI curriculum for middle school education. Our contribution is threefold: (1) Providing interdisciplinary connections to reveal the background of developing a new technology (2) Structuring the recent resources in the field to ease the integration of AI into classrooms (3) Presenting an inclusive approach with online and unplugged activities. In this paper, we present the design process of our curriculum, details about the lecture structures and it's supplementary materials. Finally, we share our observations from the teacher (n=18) and student (n=60) workshops.},

This capability enhances human interactions to a great extent. As we move towards the age of increasing Human-Machine Interaction systems, we must strive to program our machines to achieve the so-called social and emotional capabilities algorithmically. A primary research frontier in emotion detection is recognizing it using facial images. Being able to recognize the emotions of a human being helps the machine adjust and tune itself to the human's needs and comfort. Emotion detection can be performed using various modalities such as video, audio, images, text, biometric information, etc. This study, explores the emerging trends in emotion recognition through facial images. Automated recognition of emotions of people has the potential to predict psychiatric illness or other latent mental health issues.},

To improve how artificial intelligence research and the cognitive sciences can inform each other, we argue the StarCraft II Learning Environment is an ideal candidate for an environment where humans and artificial agents can be tested on the same tasks. We present an upcoming study using this environment, where the goal is to investigate how RL can be extended to enable abstract human abilities such as moments of insight. We claim this is valuable for advancing our understanding of both artificial and natural intelligence, thereby leading to improved models of player behaviour and for general video game playing.},

That embodiment will yield AI's that share our moral foundations, namely coordination, sociality, and acknowledgement of shared resources. Consequently, we can expect a broad moral alignment between human beings and AI's. AI's will likely show no more variation in their values than we find amongst human beings.},

abstract = {The traditional method of correcting oral English pronunciation is based on manual experience. However, this method has the problem of low accuracy in correcting oral English pronunciation, and the actual application effect is not ideal. The purpose of this article was to provide an efficient and accurate pronunciation correction method through graph neural networks, enabling learners to better master oral English pronunciation and improve communication skills. Graph neural networks have utilized the characteristics of graph structures to accurately analyze and correct learners’ pronunciation problems, helping them better improve their oral expression abilities. The graph neural network-based pronunciation correction model has provided a new pronunciation correction method for college English oral learners. The experimental results of this article indicated that the number of students with pronunciation accuracy, fluency, and expression ability scores above 82 after manual correction was 14, 13, and 10 fewer than those with pronunciation accuracy, fluency, and expression ability scores above 82 after graph neural network correction, respectively.},

abstract = {Machines have long been created by humans to serve many needs in life. In the length of history of technology development, they gradually improved, along with the amount and type of assigned and more diverse assigned tasks. However, the application level of the machines only stops at simple things, only requires strength and accuracy. In the areas that require flexibility, the ability to analyze situations, human intelligence, and artificial intelligence is the brain that originates the wisdom of machines. The potential benefits they bring seem impossible to limit, and the new way to utilize artificial intelligence does not stop appearing. This paper mainly deals with the issues surrounding the application of artificial intelligence to life and in approaching a rather complex language like Japanese. The application of artificial intelligence to Japanese language teaching and learning will be of great significance, helping both learners and teachers achieve certain goals in today's modern society. The paper is completed through documents, surveys and confirms the indispensable importance of artificial intelligence in the field of education.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques become more powerful and easier to use they are increasingly deployed as key components of modern software systems. While this enables new functionality and often allows better adaptation to user needs it also creates additional problems for software engineers and exposes companies to new risks. Some work has been done to better understand the interaction between Software Engineering and AI but we lack methods to classify ways of applying AI in software systems and to analyse and understand the risks this poses. Only by doing so can we devise tools and solutions to help mitigate them. This paper presents the AI in SE Application Levels (AI-SEAL) taxonomy that categorises applications according to their point of application, the type of AI technology used and the automation level allowed. We show the usefulness of this taxonomy by classifying 15 papers from previous editions of the RAISE workshop. Results show that the taxonomy allows classification of distinct AI applications and provides insights concerning the risks associated with them. We argue that this will be important for companies in deciding how to apply AI in their software applications and to create strategies for its use.},

abstract = {Shared control is an emerging interaction paradigm in which a human and an AI partner collaboratively control a system. Shared control unifies human and artificial intelligence, making the human’s interactions with computers more accessible, safe, precise, effective, creative, and playful. This form of interaction has independently emerged in contexts as varied as mobility assistance, driving, surgery, and digital games. These domains each have their own problems, terminology, and design philosophies. Without a common language for describing interactions in shared control, it is difficult for designers working in one domain to share their knowledge with designers working in another. To address this problem, we present a dimension space for shared control, based on a survey of 55 shared control systems from six different problem domains. This design space analysis tool enables designers to classify existing systems, make comparisons between them, identify higher-level design patterns, and imagine solutions to novel problems.},

abstract = {Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.},

Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students’ perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops’ influence on student perceptions of Alexa’s intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students’ perceptions of Alexa’s friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts.},

As an important ability to generate novel and useful ideas, team creativity is an important source of organizational innovation and competitive advantage. The relationship between leadership style and team creativity has always been a hot topic in the field of organizational behavior. How to stimulate team creativity is still an important problem to be solved in the innovation and development of enterprises.

abstract = {As machine learning (ML) systems have advanced, they have acquired more power over humans' lives, and questions about what values are embedded in them have become more complex and fraught. It is conceivable that in the coming decades, humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations. Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research, while others will become more important if AGI becomes more likely. These principles may encourage new thinking about the development, design, training, and release into the world of increasingly autonomous agents.},

abstract = {Over the last couple of years, Covid-19 has caused an uproar and chaos throughout the world. The occurrence of Covid-19 is an unprecedented event which has led towards a substantial number of lost humans’ lives and mayhem in the economic, social, and most importantly, healthcare systems across the world. In order to gain control of the pandemic, it is extremely pertinent to truly grasp the characteristics and behavior of the coronavirus which can be done by gathering and evaluating related big data. Furthermore, big data analytics tools are known to play an important role in building knowledge which are vital for decision making and precautionary measures. Across the world, it is evident that both government and non-governmental organizations have been working hand-in-hand to deploy big data technology. There is a plethora of data analytics methods available thus, the intention of this work is to assemble available methods which can be applied in the current pandemic.},

abstract = {OBE theory plays an important guiding role in the teaching reform of practical courses. Taking students as the centre, we divide the baking course teaching into three stages: online learning before class, internalization and sublimation in class and consolidation and strengthening after class. The classroom reform based on OBE and AI is supported by the update of teaching environment, teaching design and teaching implementation, realizing the classroom innovation and talent training. We pay attention to students' professional technology and ability to make the teaching goal clearer. We conduct the whole process assessment and evaluation of students' achievements, which is helpful to cultivate professional and skilled talents. Practice has proved that the theoretical goal completion, practical goal completion and teaching mode satisfaction of the online and offline hybrid teaching mode of baking course based on OBE concept are higher than the corresponding indicators under the traditional model. The online and offline mixed teaching mode of baking course based on OBE theory can fully enhance learning interest and learning effect.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence technology has gradually become an important auxiliary means for people to obtain medical consultation. However, many researches reflect users' doubts about the feedback results of AI system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of the user-friendly intelligent self diagnosis system, using interdisciplinary research methods. Firstly, based on the psychological questionnaire and interview, this paper studies the public's cognition of the intelligent self diagnosis system, and discusses how to effectively improve the user's recognition and trust of the intelligent self diagnosis system. It is found that the credibility of the intelligent self diagnosis system can be improved by further improving the transparency of the system. For example, users can be provided with four different types of information, including system reasoning, system reliability, information source and personalized information. On the basis of interviews, 48 volunteers were invited to carry out a comparative experiment in groups to evaluate the impact of medical interpretation of intelligent self diagnosis system on patients' perception and trust under different transparency and accuracy models. We found that the improvement of system reliability information (i.e. accuracy model and confidence score) composed of accuracy model and confidence score strengthens patients' cognition of AI system and improves the user trust of the system; while the detailed display of system reasoning and logic can improve the comprehensibility of medical advice output of the system, but does not substantially improve the user trust. At the end of this paper, some suggestions are put forward to design an interpretable and reliable intelligent self diagnosis system.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human thought processes and consciousness on computer systems. Experts have gone so far as to chart the future development of AI systems that surpass human intelligence as a single civilization-shifting event, known as the "technological singularity" or "the Singularity." But in the more near future, AI promises to have more concrete applications throughout our everyday lives, including in education, a challenge that China has already taken up. At present, the main applications of this so-called "weak" artificial intelligence in Chinese education are MOOC, web classes, and the flipped class model, with the results already proving outstanding. With the deeper combination of AI and education, we can look forward to benefits like the increasing usefulness of after-school tutoring robots, reliving teachers of burdensome responsibilities, and balancing global education resources. We should, however, also use AI in education reasonably by contextualizing gathered data, strengthening legal protections, and developing moral guidelines in machine programming. Addressing these three points will address the concerns of many laypeople as AI systems are implemented, offering protection for their fragile beginnings in education and encouraging the development of better ones in the future.},

abstract = {With advancement in technology-driven decision making, the software-intensive systems for decisions have become more robust, dynamic, adaptive, context-aware, dependable. Architectural designs of such systems crave for new approaches where the data-driven decision making has to be incorporated in the solution. Methods for recommendation mechanism, prediction of operation failures, dealing with unsafe conditions etc are going to be part of the solution itself. Integrating such features to conceive an intelligent system that will directly influence the business solution is mostly appreciated. This would not have been possible without the direct interference of Artificial Intelligence which has been a standard procedure of industrial repertoire since 1980s. The direct impact of AI on social and economic life has been been felt mostly in last decade (since 2007) with the advent of smart phone, which contribute largely to "big data". The era of "big data" has witnessed the efficacy of Machine Learning and there is a need of the hour to combine data-driven machine intelligence with human intelligence (insights and domain knowledge) to effectively make the software development (requirement, design, testing, deployment and operation management) intelligent. The research community has shown a keen interest in this emerging field. In this report, we present a pre-organization summary of the workshop to be held on February 27, 2020, at IIIT Jabbalpur (India), co-located with the 13th Innovations in Software Engineering Conference (ISEC 2020).},

abstract = {The public sector holds enormous potential for the use of artificial intelligence, which is also recognized and supported by the government. To realize this potential, however, it is imperative that civil servants have the necessary knowledge to recognise and optimally exploit the application and utilisation possibilities of AI. Massive open online courses (MOOC) are a promising way to help civil servants gain that required knowledge. But how can such a course be designed to become accepted by this target group? In this paper, we present a human-centered development approach to develop a MOOC about AI for civil servants. Using an analysis of the target audience’s mental models, knowledge needs, and attitudes, we iteratively developed short learning units that ground the abstract AI topics in concrete case scenarios taken from the public sector. First results of an expert evaluation (expertise in adult education, public sector, and AI) look promising and further evaluations with the target group are planned.},

abstract = {Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which automatically finds an architecture that works best on a given hardware design, has prevailed in response to the ever-growing demand for real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in many situations, the underlying hardware is not pre-determined. We argue that simply assuming an arbitrary yet fixed hardware design will lead to inferior solutions, and it is best to co-explore neural architecture space and hardware design space for the best pair of neural architecture and hardware design. To demonstrate this, we employ Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the infrastructure and propose a novel framework, namely NANDS, to co-explore NAS space and NoC Design Search (NDS) space with the objective to maximize accuracy and throughput. Since two metrics are tightly coupled, we develop a multi-phase manager to guide NANDS to gradually converge to solutions with the best accuracy-throughput tradeoff. On top of it, we propose techniques to detect and alleviate timing performance bottleneck, which allows better and more efficient exploration of NDS space. Experimental results on common datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10, show that compared with state-of-the-art hardware-aware NAS, NANDS can achieve 42.99% higher throughput along with 1.58% accuracy improvement. There are cases where hardware-aware NAS cannot find any feasible solutions while NANDS can.},

The main purpose of this article is to study the sports rehabilitation of patients with scoliosis under the background of big data. Through a large amount of literature analysis, this article summarizes the concept of scoliosis, the classification of scoliosis, and the etiology of scoliosis, which provides theoretical support for the study of sports rehabilitation methods for patients with scoliosis. In this article, while understanding the current research status of rehabilitation treatment for patients with scoliosis, I consulted a large number of research reports and cases of rehabilitation treatment for scoliosis patients at home and abroad, and learned that there are surgical treatment methods and non-operative treatments in the rehabilitation of idiopathic scoliosis. There are two surgical treatments, among which non-surgical treatments are more commonly used in adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis. In order to understand the practicality of corrective actions and the psychological feelings of patients, this article prepares corrective action experiments and satisfaction survey experiments for patients with scoliosis. Research experiments show that more than 75% of people are satisfied with scoliosis rehabilitation through exercise above 80 points, and patients are more recognized and accept the exercise rehabilitation model; most corrective actions are beneficial to patients with scoliosis Rehabilitation.},

Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called ”algorithmic bias” of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.},

abstract = {Interactive and tangible computing platforms have garnered increased interest in the pursuit of embedding active learning pedagogies within curricula through educational technologies. Whilst Tangible User Interface (TUI) systems have successfully been developed to edutain children in various research, TUI architectures have seen limited deployment in more complex and abstract domains. In light of these limitations, this paper proposes an active TUI framework that addresses the challenges experienced in teaching and learning artificial intelligence (AI) within higher educational institutions. The proposal extends an aptly designed tabletop TUI architecture with the novel interactive paradigm of active tangible manipulatives to provide a more engaging and effective user interaction. The paper describes the deployment of the proposed TUI framework within an undergraduate laboratory session to aid in the teaching and learning of artificial neural networks. The experiment is assessed against currently adopted educational computer software and the obtained results highlight the potential of the proposed TUI framework to augment students? gain in knowledge and understanding of abstracted threshold concepts in higher education.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

abstract = {There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at a crucial point in its development: stable enough to be used in production systems, and increasingly pervasive in our lives. What does that mean for its safety? In his book Normal Accidents, the sociologist Charles Perrow proposed a framework to analyze new technologies and the risks they entail. He showed that major accidents are nearly unavoidable in complex systems with tightly coupled components if they are run long enough. In this essay, we apply and extend Perrow’s framework to AI to assess its potential risks. Today’s AI systems are already highly complex, and their complexity is steadily increasing. As they become more ubiquitous, different algorithms will interact directly, leading to tightly coupled systems whose capacity to cause harm we will be unable to predict. We argue that under the current paradigm, Perrow’s normal accidents apply to AI systems and it is only a matter of time before one occurs.

abstract = {Development of accurate measurement systems to assess digital government advance is a critical topic of digital agenda of academia and governments around the world. There are several quantitative approaches such as rankings and indicators that have contributed to measure the progress of digital government initiatives in the public sector, but more sophisticated computational tools are usually unexploited. This article proposes a computational multi-parametric analysis of multiple metrics of digital government advance using a computational technique, the neural networks, for the analysis of the evolution of digital government ranking of Mexican states during the period 2009-2015. Neural networks analysis has been used in different areas such as scientometric performance profiles, and disciplines like physics, chemistry, management, economics and demography. The neural networks analysis helps to identify clusters of characterizations that represents digital government advance patterns of performance. It also locates various profiles of digital government progress with similar patterns of performance and atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with classical tools. The results of this computational technique are robust showing that artificial intelligence tools are useful instruments to evaluate digital government advance overtime.},

Despite thumbnails' omnipresence and their assumed effect on sales, they largely constitute a black box for research and practice. This work aims to fill this gap and asks, with regard to hedonic information goods: What is the role of thumbnails in the purchase process and how and why do their basic, conceptual and social features impact sales? To answer the question, we first analytically and empirically show that thumbnails play a more central role in the purchase process for hedonic information goods than for other types of goods. Next, we develop a variance model on how and why thumbnails affect sales. Using artificial intelligence imagery analysis, we test the model against evidence from sales data of 100,000 hedonic information goods from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings entail theoretical contributions to the growing field of consumers' visual information processing in e-commerce contexts and lead us to implications for managerial practice.},

In this paper we provide a novel approach in teaching Advanced Programming Methods, the third introductory course in Software Engineering that is being taught at our faculty within the Computer Science Curriculum for undergraduate students.  The contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly, we design a student-centered learning process intertwining cutting edge methods like for instance project-based learning, self assessment-based learning and students engagement. Secondly, we design an E-learning platform to provide for students an automated assessment and appropriate feedback and, most important, to offer them support throughout the learning process. Thirdly, we provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis over 3 years of teaching Advanced Programming Methods course, by applying the proposed methodology.  Our analysis results show the effectiveness of our approach. Key contributions in this paper are our proposed E-learning platform and the analysis findings.},

abstract = {People are getting familiar with cryptocurrencies because of the rapid development of cryptography, and bitcoin, a traditional decentralized digital currency, becomes famous. Thus, it is necessary to establish a digital currency allocation framework. Two existing methods both share the same goal of reaching blockchain consensus; however, the processes are different: The proof of Work system is completely related to tasks, but the Proof of Stake system is related to tokens. Hence, service providers are more than glad to apply the Proof of Work theory after distinguishing the difference between these two systems; this system which does not have high limitations is more fair and balanced. To enhance the traditional Proof of Work system, Artificial Intelligence can properly help and make the new framework works more efficiently. AI model can pre-assign a trustworthy score via the IP address, and then it can take the responsibility to generate the puzzle for the qualification. After the model verifies the output, the trustworthy score can increase or decrease based on the performance. Finally, it can establish a loop from the trustworthy score to puzzle difficulty, and then back to the trustworthy score. Therefore, an AI assistant can accurately monitor the entire transaction process and ensure validation to be environmentally friendly.},

The goals of the pilot program are to increase interest in AI, contextualize technically rigorous AI concepts through societal impact, and address barriers that could discourage 10th grade girls from pursuing computer science. In this paper we describe the curriculum designed to achieve these goals. Survey results show students had a statistically significant increase in technical knowledge, interest in pursuing careers in AI, and confidence in succeeding in AI and computer science. Additionally, survey results show that the majority of the students found new role models, faculty support, and a sense of community in AI and computer science.},

abstract = {Ethical concerns regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have fueled discussions around the ethics training received by AI designers. We claim that training designers for ethical behaviour, understood as habitual application of ethical principles in any situation, can make a significant difference in the practice of research, development, and application of AI systems. Building on interdisciplinary knowledge and practical experience from computer science, moral psychology and development, and pedagogy, we propose a functional way to provide this training.

abstract = {Manually finding the program unit (e.g., class, method, or statement) responsible for a fault is tedious and time-consuming. To mitigate this problem, many fault localization techniques have been proposed. A popular family of such techniques is spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), which takes program execution traces (spectra) of failed and passed test cases as input and applies a ranking formula to compute a suspiciousness score for each program unit. However, most existing SBFL techniques fail to consider two facts: 1) not all failed test cases contribute equally to a considered fault(s), and 2) program units collaboratively contribute to the failure/pass of each test case in different ways.In this study, we propose a novel idea that first models the SBFL task as a classification problem of predicting whether a test case will fail or pass based on spectra information on program units. We subsequently apply eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to infer the local importance of each program unit to the prediction of each executed test case. Applying XAI to the failed test case, we retrieve information about which program statements within the test case that are considered the most important (i.e., have the biggest effect in making the test case failed). Such a design can automatically learn the unique contributions of failed test cases to the suspiciousness of a program unit by learning the different and collaborative contributions of program units to each test case's executed result. As far as we know, this is the first XAI-supported SBFL approach. We evaluate the new approach on the Defects4J benchmark dataset.We compare the performance of our approach against five popular SBFL techniques: DStar, Tarantula, Barinel, Ochiai, and OP. We measure their performance using the Top-K and EXAM scores. In particular, we focus on the result of the Top-1, which importance has been highlighted in automated program repair domain, where the proposed methods often assume perfect fault localization (i.e., the fault must be found at the first rank of the suspiciousness list). Our results show that our approach, named XAI4FL, has a statistically significant and substantially better performance in terms of Top-1 than the SBFL approaches. We also compare our approach with a simpler approach to get feature importance in a tree-based model (i.e., using the Mean Decrease in Impurity method). Our results show that XAI4FL statistically significantly outperforms the MDI method in Top-K and EXAM score. Our results and findings highlight that the utilization of XAI for fault localization can improve the overall results of fault localization techniques.},

abstract = {In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.},

abstract = {Efficiency and effectiveness of learning process can be improved by adaptations to learners' learning styles. But for the time being, most of existing education systems lack of adaptation or personalization; every learner is delivered the same learning contents. Many researchers have been studying to find out an efficient way of students' learning style identification for a better personalization. In our study, we concentrate on intelligent agents that can provide the learners with personal assistants to carry out learning activities according to their learning styles and knowledge level. In this paper, we present a new literature-based method that uses learners' behaviours on learning objects as indicators for estimating students' learning styles during an online course conducted in our POLCA learning management system. The evaluation of learning style estimation and adaptation from our experiment show a high precision. Together with the mentioned benefits of learning style adaptation, this result indicates that our method is capable for wide use.},

abstract = {Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved its momentum in various areas such as image processing and natural language processing thanks to the advances in processing speed, data acquisition and storage. Many research efforts have been exerted to apply AI to computer networking. Performance evaluation of network systems using AI techniques can be conducted using ns-3, and such studies can be facilitated if ns-3 is able to interact with the existing open-source AI frameworks. In the past year, an ns-3 extension module called ns3-gym connecting ns-3 with the OpenAI Gym toolkit has been developed, which utilizes Zero MQ sockets as an interprocess communications (IPC) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a newly designed module between ns-3 and multiple Python-based AI frameworks, namely ns3-ai, to provide efficient and high-speed data exchange between the AI engines and ns-3. This module is built based on a shared memory implementation for IPC, which can achieve an IPC transfer speed up to 100 times faster than that of ns3-gym on a benchmark example. We also present our high-level interface design to improve the abstraction between ns-3 and different AI frameworks, and provide an example use case based on a 5G NR scenario. Our evaluation results show that this ns3-ai framework offers performance advantages over ns3-gym, especially for the use cases where large amounts of data must be transferred between ns-3 and the AI framework. This ns-3 extension module may foster the performance evaluation of AI algorithms in computer networking research with much reduced development workload.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing technologies has revolutionized distance education by enabling real-time interaction, personalized learning experiences, and scalable educational infrastructures. IoT devices, through real-time data collection and feedback, have improved the engagement and interactivity of online learning environments, while cloud computing provides the computational power and storage necessary to support largescale Learning Management Systems (LMS). However, the implementation of these technologies in education faces several challenges, including network latency, device interoperability, data security, and high deployment costs. This paper systematically examines the applications of IoT and cloud computing in distance education and explores the key technical and security challenges associated with these technologies. Additionally, it provides insights into emerging technologies such as 5G, edge computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, which are expected to enhance the future potential of IoT and cloud computing in education. The research demonstrates that despite the existing challenges, the integration of IoT and cloud computing technologies will continue to drive innovation in distance education, contributing to improved education quality and global accessibility.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widely utilized, there is a need for non-computer scientists to understand 1) how the technology works, and 2) how it can impact their lives. Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced. To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course.},

Commonly known as AutoML or AutoAI, these technologies aim to relieve data scientists from the tedious manual work. However, today's AutoAI systems often present only limited to no information about the process of how they select and generate model results. Thus, users often do not understand the process, neither do they trust the outputs. In this short paper, we provide a first user evaluation by 10 data scientists of an experimental system, AutoAIViz, that aims to visualize AutoAI's model generation process. We find that the proposed system helps users to complete the data science tasks, and increases their understanding, toward the goal of increasing trust in the AutoAI system.},

abstract = {The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. "Kisan One" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.},

abstract = {New technologies, particularly those which are deployed rapidly across sectors, or which have to operate in competitive conditions, can disrupt previously stable technology governance regimes. This leads to a precarious need to balance caution against performance while exploring the resulting 'safe operating space'. This paper will argue that Artificial Intelligence is one such critical technology, the responsible deployment of which is likely to prove especially complex, because even narrow AI applications often involve networked (tightly coupled, opaque) systems operating in complex or competitive environments. This ensures such systems are prone to 'normal accident'-type failures which can cascade rapidly, and are hard to contain or even detect in time. Legal and governance approaches to the deployment of AI will have to reckon with the specific causes and features of such 'normal accidents'. While this suggests that large-scale, cascading errors in AI systems are inevitable, an examination of the operational features that lead technologies to exhibit 'normal accidents' enables us to derive both tentative principles for precautionary policymaking, and practical recommendations for the safe(r) deployment of AI systems. This may help enhance the safety and security of these systems in the public sphere, both in the short- and in the long term.},

abstract = {This paper describes [self.], an open source art installation that embodies artificial intelligence (AI) in order to learn, react, respond and be creative in its environment. Biologically inspired models are implemented to achieve this behaviour. The robot is built using a moving head, projector, camera and microphones. No form of knowledge or grammar have been implemented in the AI, the system starts in a ``tabula rasa' state and learns everything via its own sensory channels, forming categories in a bottom-up fashion. The robot recognizes sounds, and is able to recognize similar sounds, link them with the corresponding faces, and use the knowledge of past experiences to form new sentences. It projects neural memories that represent an association between sound and video as experienced during interaction.},

The theoretical-methodological structure built in the doctoral research promoted the evolution of the debate about openness through the debate of the ecosystem of open government with multiple actors. In addition, the results indicate the need for the evolution of open government strategies to an ecosystem capable of integrating multiple parties in the development of public policies, for this, it is necessary to invest in "collaborative data" between civil society, private organizations and the government sector. The new support for decision-making and evidence is reinforced by political algorithm and artificial intelligence devices as software. In addition, we have awakened to the need for an emerging framework of regulation, ethics, inclusion, transparency and open governance for "political algorithms."},

This study explored how 165 educators designed and integrated 12,749 TLA in 218 LDs using clustering, pattern-mining, and correlational analysis. The findings suggest most educators use a combination of four common LD TLAs (i.e., Collaboration, Generating independent learning, Assessment, and Traditional classroom activities). The four common TLAs could be used to develop LA and Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) approaches to support educators in making more informed and evidence-based design decisions for effective learning and teaching.},

However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.},

While online platforms offer flexibility and convenience, they also present challenges in monitoring and evaluating student behavior and learning outcomes. Traditional data analysis methods often struggle with the vast, complex, and unstructured data generated by these platforms. This study proposes a method based on deep learning, specifically utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These models process time series and multi-dimensional behavior data, extracting key features to classify student learning behaviors into active participation, passive participation, and irregular participation. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, validating its effectiveness in classifying online learning behaviors. The implications for educational theories and pedagogies are significant, providing a foundation for developing more responsive and supportive online learning environments.},

Traditional programming-based approaches can be daunting for students unfamiliar with coding. Initially, software tools like RapidMiner, Weka, and Orange Data Mining were employed to simplify the learning process. However, this method often fell short in conveying deep ML concepts, which often resulted in a superficial understanding. With the advent of user-friendly coding aids like ChatGPT, a transition to Python-based instruction was implemented. Additionally, the incorporation of active learning strategies has further enhanced student engagement and understanding. This shift has shown to improve comprehension and practical skills, evidenced by higher median and maximum grades on the evaluation tool, a final project. A multiple linear regression analysis suggested that performance in “Big Data” significantly predicts grades on the Artificial Intelligence module, and the teaching approach has a marginally significant impact. Subjective analysis by the professor, also proved a better grasp of the concepts by the students.},

abstract = {As the demand for personalized and adaptive learning experiences increase, there is a urgent need for providing effective feedback mechanisms within critical systems, such as in psychomotor learning systems. This proposal introduces an approach for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation tools to provide comprehensive and insightful feedback to users. By combining the strengths of retrieval-based techniques and generative models, these tools offer the potential to enhance learning outcomes by delivering tailored feedback that is both informative and engaging. The proposal also emphasises the importance of incorporating explainability and transparency concepts. Following the hybrid intelligence paradigm it is possible to ensure that the feedback provided by these tools is not only accurate but also understandable to humans. This approach fosters trust and promotes a deeper understanding of the psychomotor learning process, empowering users and facilitators to make informed decisions about the psychomotor learning path. The hybrid intelligence paradigm, which combines the strengths of both human and artificial intelligence, plays a crucial role in the deployment of these solutions. By taking advantage of the cognitive capabilities of human experts alongside the computational power of artificial intelligence algorithms, it is possible to offer personalised feedback that takes into account both technical accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness. Through these collaborative efforts it is also possible to create learning environments that are inclusive, adaptable, and beneficial to lifelong learning. In conclusion, this proposal introduces retrieval-augmented generation tools for providing feedback in psychomotor learning systems, which represents a significant step towards in its personalization, and whose ethical implications align with the new regulations on the implementation of intelligent technologies in critical systems.},

At the same time, AI is increasingly incorporated into government functions and the public sector. We propose that governments and the public sector can set an example for the responsible use of AI technologies by following the principles of algorithmic governance traditionally recommended to the private sector. Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

abstract = {In today's world of pervasive connectivity and intelligent technologies, modern networked systems-ranging from sprawling data centers to large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems-have grown by leaps and bounds, unlocking numerous transformative services, like smart cities, immersive mixed reality, and generative artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional network optimization and resource allocation methods-built around static models-are increasingly unable to keep up with the evolving demands of these largescale environments. AI-driven solutions are emerging as game-changers, enabling networked systems to process massive streams of data in real time and adapt seamlessly to ever-changing demands. For instance, AI-powered softwaredefined networking (SDN) controllers can instantly reroute traffic in data centers to prevent congestion, while reinforcement learning (RL)-based task offloading can intelligently allocate resources in massive IoT systems. These advancements make AI central to the next generation of intelligent, adaptive network ecosystems.},

abstract = {As one of the most complex parts in manufacturing systems, scheduling plays an important role in the efficient allocation of resources to meet individual customization requirements. However, due to the uncertain disruptions (e.g., task arrival time, service breakdown duration) of manufacturing processes, how to respond to various dynamics in manufacturing to keep the scheduling process moving forward smoothly and efficiently is becoming a major challenge in dynamic manufacturing scheduling. To solve such a problem, a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to (1) accurately construct dynamic scheduling models that can represent both personalized customer needs and uncertain provider capabilities and (2) efficiently obtain a qualified schedule within a limited time. From these two perspectives, this article systemically makes a state-of-the-art literature survey on the application of these artificial intelligence techniques in dynamic manufacturing modeling and scheduling. It first introduces two types of dynamic scheduling problems that consider service- and task-related disruptions in the manufacturing process, respectively, followed by a bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence techniques for dynamic manufacturing scheduling. Next, various kinds of artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers for solving dynamic scheduling problems including both directed heuristics and autonomous learning methods are reviewed, which strive not only to quickly obtain optimized solutions but also to effectively achieve the adaption to dynamics. Finally, this article further elaborates on the future opportunities and challenges of using artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers to solve complex dynamic scheduling problems. In summary, this survey aims to present a thorough and organized overview of artificial-intelligence-enabled dynamic manufacturing scheduling and shed light on some related research directions that are worth studying in the future.},

abstract = {Purposes: Through machine learning analysis of objective data from digital physical education learning (DPEL) platforms, explore the relationship and degree of correlation between student engagement and performance assessment, and predict final grades. Utilize grounded theory analysis to investigate the reasons, phenomena, and experiences of students participating in DPEL. The goal is to understand and clarify the factors influencing student engagement in DPEL, forming a theoretical framework and action guidelines. Develop an intelligent learning and feedback system for students participating in DPEL based on artificial intelligence. Utilize a comprehensive understanding of student engagement to create a more sophisticated and accurate intelligent learning and assessment mechanism.Methods: Utilizing a multifaceted approach, the research comprehensively investigated student engagement in DPEL. The quantitative aspect involved collecting and analyzing data from a digitized learning system. It utilized correlation analysis and machine learning algorithms to explore the relationship between participation, performance, and predict final grades. Qualitative insights were gathered through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, applying rigorous analysis methods to form a robust theoretical framework. Additionally, the study innovatively integrated machine learning and natural language processing techniques to develop an intelligent digital sports learning and feedback system.Results: The relationship between the variables of student engagement, specifically dwell time and visit frequency, is highly significant, showing a strong positive correlation. Dwell time emerges as a robust indicator among these variables, and there is a positive correlation among the three engagement variables. Each cluster created exhibits significant differences in characteristics, confirming that as learning engagement increases, assessment scores also rise. The predictive performance of the constructed random forest model on the test set is satisfactory, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 2.06 and a final test accuracy of 81.25%. Sociocultural factors, Digital learning ecosystem, and Psychophysiological factors are identified as the primary influencing dimensions on student engagement in DPEL. Furthermore, leveraging previous research findings and literature reviews, an integration of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques has resulted in the development of a Student Engagement Learning and Feedback System for DPEL.Conclusion: Student engagement and assessment scores serve as robust predictors of performance in physical education. Proactive interventions targeted at enhancing student engagement can effectively contribute to improved performance in physical education. The elucidation of key factors influencing student engagement in DPEL provides valuable insights for devising effective intervention measures. The developed intelligent learning and feedback system has the potential to provide substantial support to DPEL, potentially enhancing or fundamentally transforming approaches in DPEL.},

abstract = {The accelerating pace of developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increasing role that technology plays in society necessitates substantial changes in the structure of the workforce. Besides scientists and engineers, there is a need for a very large workforce of competent AI technicians (i.e., maintainers, integrators) and users (i.e., operators). As traditional 4-year and 2-year degree-based education cannot fill this quickly opening gap, alternative training methods have to be developed. We present the results of the first four years of the AI Technicians program which is a unique collaboration between the U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) and Carnegie Mellon University to design, implement and evaluate novel rapid occupational training methods to create a competitive AI workforce at the technicians level. Through this multi-year effort we have already trained 59 AI Technicians. A key observation is that ongoing frequent updates to the training are necessary as the adoption of AI in the U.S. Army and within the society at large is evolving rapidly. A tight collaboration among the stakeholders from the army and the university is essential for successful development and maintenance of the training for the evolving role. Our findings can be leveraged by large organizations that face the challenge of developing a competent AI workforce as well as educators and researchers engaged in solving the challenge.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence applications permeate our lives and are increasingly making the news, surprising society with applications that until a few years ago would have been relegated to the science fiction genre. Thanks to generative artificial intelligence, tools that once could only be used by highly qualified technical personnel are now in the hands of potentially inexperienced users, but unfortunately, the understanding of the layman is very far from the machinery behind the scenes. More than ever, it is necessary to help people develop an awareness that allows them to use these tools in an appropriate way and with the appropriate expectations. We believe this problem should be addressed by exploring ways to train thinking strategies to facilitate understanding of machine learning concepts that can be applied in daily life, not just by developing teaching tools on this or that topic.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), and especially its sub-field of Machine Learning (ML), are impacting the daily lives of everyone with their ubiquitous applications. In recent years, AI researchers and practitioners have introduced principles and guidelines to build systems that make reliable and trustworthy decisions. From a practical perspective, conventional ML systems process historical data to extract the features that are consequently used to train ML models that perform the desired task. However, in practice, a fundamental challenge arises when the system needs to be operationalized and deployed to evolve and operate in real-life environments continuously. To address this challenge, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) have emerged as a potential recipe for standardizing ML solutions in deployment. Although MLOps demonstrated great success in streamlining ML processes, thoroughly defining the specifications of robust MLOps approaches remains of great interest to researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the trustworthiness property of MLOps systems. Specifically, we highlight technical practices to achieve robust MLOps systems. In addition, we survey the existing research approaches that address the robustness aspects of ML systems in production. We also review the tools and software available to build MLOps systems and summarize their support to handle the robustness aspects. Finally, we present the open challenges and propose possible future directions and opportunities within this emerging field. The aim of this paper is to provide researchers and practitioners working on practical AI applications with a comprehensive view to adopt robust ML solutions in production environments.},

abstract = {The rapid digitization of urban infrastructure and the availability of urban data have created opportunities for developing and using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms to address cities' difficult problems. This research offers a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art AI, ML, and DL algorithms in urban artificial intelligence (AI). This encompasses land use, energy control, public safety, and traffic forecasting. We investigated urban-AI algorithms, and results show that ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) can achieve 94% accuracy in urban growth prediction, while Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have demonstrated power in accurately classifying objects such as built-up areas and vegetation. On the other hand, DL algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can attain 79% accuracy in satellite image classification, while Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network are useful in time-series prediction tasks such as traffic flow forecasting, urban air quality prediction, and energy consumption modeling. However, the limitations of these algorithms, particularly when dealing with large datasets, could potentially restrict their scalability in real-time applications. Furthermore, we have identified ethical considerations such as privacy and surveillance, algorithmic bias and fairness, transparency and interpretability, accountability and human oversight, social inclusion, and civic participation, all of which require attention. This has resulted in a variety of suggestions, including creating guidelines for using AI for urban performance to address ethical issues. Future research directions should focus on integrating AI with emerging technologies such as 5G and developing robust frameworks for responsible AI governance in smart cities.},

One such innovation is teachable AI agents, designed as learners to facilitate learning by teaching. Previous research has evidenced the benefits of learning by teaching, and its effectiveness depends on the quality of tutor-tutee interaction. However, few studies have explored how features of teachable agents, particularly personality traits, influence student interactions and the agents’ effectiveness. Given the documented importance of personality traits in student learning, this empirical study examines the relationship between teachable AI agents’ personality traits and students’ math learning experiences in a naturalistic setting. Results indicated that students provided more cognitive support when interacting with teachable agents characterized by neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness, while more affect management and non-responsive behaviors were observed with agents displaying extraversion. These interaction patterns impacted the effectiveness of the teachable agents, providing implications for the integration of AI systems into education.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Generative Artificial Experts (GAEs) - a concept of a new type of generative AI agents designed for human-AI collaboration in knowledge work. GAEs have specialized domain expertise, perform tasks within bounded autonomy, include a synthetic persona and possess multimodal generative AI capabilities, among other features. We provide a definition of GAEs which includes seven defining traits, offering a taxonomy which sets them apart from other generative AI systems. We use literature-review based conceptual analysis with abductive reasoning to propose the new concept that addresses identified limitations in existing systems. The paper explores the emergence of GAEs as a leap from expert systems. We name two enablers for GAEs - ongoing development of a research field of human-AI collaboration and growing capabilities of generative artificial intelligence systems. We discuss existing generative AI agents, noting that GAEs as such do not exist yet, but are starting to emerge. Due conceptual nature of this paper we do not explore the technical aspects of GAEs development. Instead, we use illustrative examples to present possible applications of GAEs and their potential role in the future of knowledge work.

abstract = {Traditional learning environments often fail to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities due to various barriers, such as limited physical accessibility and a lack of personalized learning approaches. The emerging metaverse holds the potential to revolutionize education with its immersive and interactive capabilities, overcoming these traditional limitations. Despite research on metaverse-based inclusive learning, there is still a significant need for solutions that offer customized learning for various disabilities, comprehensive virtual support from educators and therapists, and enhanced analysis of student progress through cloud computing. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces a motivational scenario for an inclusive metaverse learning platform from which we derive the requirements for this platform. The paper identifies gaps in the existing literature, proposes an early metaverse architecture, and discusses potential research challenges. Utilizing a combination of advanced technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Federated Learning (FL), cloud computing, and blockchain, the proposed architecture aims to provide personalized educational experiences while ensuring robust data analysis, privacy, and security. Through this architecture, the study demonstrates how metaverse technologies can transform educational practices, making them more accessible and effective for students with disabilities.},

However, due to the complex and diverse nature of process data and its scattered storage locations, teachers often face challenges such as the inability to obtain timely teaching feedback, difficulty in evaluating teaching effectiveness, lack of credibility in the evaluation system, and challenges in integrating and sharing evaluation results. To address these issues, we utilized blockchain technology and intelligent recommendation algorithms to build a decentralized and traceable intelligent assessment and feedback system for academic performance. By scientifically analyzing students' process data, this system recommends personalized learning resources for students, effectively promoting reform and innovation in education models under the background of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {With the wider application of the Internet, video transmission has gradually become an important way to obtain information. However, traditional video transmission control methods still have problems such as large transmission delays, poor bandwidth utilization, and so on. This paper aims to optimize video transmission control using Artificial Intelligence (AI), to better improve video quality and enhance the stability of video transmission. A video transmission control model was constructed using deep Q-networks, and buffer overflow and buffer underflow were dynamically analyzed; furthermore, video transmission control was achieved through user experience QoE (Quality of Experience) and adaptive bit rate algorithms; finally, the effectiveness of AI in video transmission control was verified. Through empirical research, it was found that the average transmission delay of short video transmission under the AI method in this paper was only 14.194 milliseconds, and the average bandwidth utilization rate reached 80.37%; the average transmission delay under traditional methods was 50.999 milliseconds, and the average bandwidth utilization was 49.73%. The method proposed in this paper can significantly reduce transmission delay and improve bandwidth utilization when applied to video transmission control. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in video transmission control, providing more methods for improving video transmission quality.},

abstract = {With the growing popularization of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, the development of systems that rely on, at least, one of its subareas has also experienced a great increase. The recent adoption of AI techniques in common systems - such as mobile apps and household appliances - requires a higher level of attention, to ensure their safety and proper operation. In this scenario, assuring the adequate functioning of these solutions culminates, in most cases, in ensuring the security of the application and its data throughout the software development life cycle. Software developers, however, often find security-related tasks challenging to learn and execute, and frequently put them aside. Additionally, currently available threat modeling frameworks are difficult to integrate into software development life cycles, which prioritize agility and automation over extensive analysis and documentation. This work, therefore, proposes sAIfe, a new threat modeling method for security analysis of AI applications under development. By providing prescriptive steps, a graphical reference element and ready-made remediation suggestions, this approach aims at simplifying the risk assessment process for the programmer, unveiling possible weaknesses and suggesting respective solutions in a practical way. sAIfe is tested on a real-world AI application, revealing positive results, with many potential issues and mitigation options detected by the method, which are registered in the form of a case study. Finally, a validation with developers in academia is also carried out, returning great feedback on sAIfe’s ease of use and speed of application.},

This paper presents an ABAB reversal design study conducted during a teacher training, where an AI-driven feedback system helped 19 teachers to create learning designs. It investigates the impact that the AI-driven feedback had on the quality of designs and assesses pre- and post-training shifts in teachers’ perceptions of the technology. We observed statistical differences between designs crafted without (in phase A1) and with AI (B1). Notably, a small positive influence persisted even after AI withdrawal (A2). This hints that specialized AI algorithms for learning design can assist teachers in effectively achieving their design objectives. Despite noticeable shifts in teachers’ perceived understanding and usefulness of AI, their trust and intention to use remained unchanged. For a successful teacher-AI partnership, future research should explore the long-term impact that AI usage can have on learning design practices and strategies to nurture trust.},

We conducted an exploratory needs analysis using participatory methods (workshops, questionnaires and interviews) and defined suitable use cases. We observed a high level of interest in the proposed AI-supported system. However, participants expressed doubts about the effective implementation due to the current state of their hospital’s digital infrastructure. The resulting use cases focused on the reception, processing and interpretation of "plausible" data.

abstract = {With data science entering various domains, new branches are emerging due to the extraction of latent knowledge from each domain's data. Model-based engineering and modeling are no exceptions. Now is the time to open a new chapter in this field by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques. As the number and complexity of models increase, NP-complete problems arise that cannot be effectively addressed through deterministic management solutions. An effective way to address these challenges is by applying non-deterministic intelligent methodologies and data science-derived solutions. The increasing number of models and the formation of large model repositories necessitate intelligent model management, which aims to recognize hidden patterns and knowledge within these repositories using data science, machine learning techniques, and statistical and probabilistic methods for reuse. Despite the progress made in this area, both theoretically and practically, intelligent model management has not yet secured a prominent place in the body of knowledge of model-driven engineering. In this paper, we aim to clarify the exact position of intelligent model management by providing precise definitions, distinguishing it from conventional management, and identifying associated challenges. The above objective outlines the research approach in this area, making it easy for researchers to comprehend the procedures they employ for conducting their investigations.},

However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students’ passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers’ responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment.},

abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

abstract = {Background: Lately, the reproducibility of scientific results has become an increasing worry in the scientific community. Several studies show that artificial intelligence research is not spared from reproducibility issues.
Objectives: As a pioneer in open and transparent research published on the Internet, the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) seeks to promote good research practices and close the feedback loop between the original researchers and those reproducing their research.
 Methods: Four different mechanisms will be adopted immediately by JAIR. These are: 1) reproducibility checklists, 2) structured abstracts, 3) reproducibility badges and 4) reproducibility reports.
Results: All authors submitting articles to JAIR fill out a reproducibility checklist and are encouraged to use structured abstracts. Articles that fulfill certain criteria will receive reproducibility badges, and reproducibility reports can be submitted by anyone for any article published in JAIR.
Conclusions: We believe that adopting the four mechanisms outlined in this paper will improve the reproducibility of research published in JAIR and thus make a contribution to addressing the broader reproducibility issue in artificial intelligence. We hope that JAIR’s reproducibility initiative will inspire similar efforts at other top-tier journals.},

abstract = {In recent years, platforms such as learning management systems and massive open online courses have provided abundant learning resources. However, the issue of allowing individuals to control and manage their lifelong learning data while protecting their privacy remains to be resolved. In this study, we developed a decentralized learning data aggregation and management architecture named Active Study. Within the Active Study architecture, individuals can aggregate and manage their personal learning records and achievements in their ubiquitous personal online datastore (UPOD). Utilizing the ActivityPub protocol, which is widely applied in decentralized social networks, UPOD not only unifies and centralizes the management of LMS and MOOC data but also aggregates physiological and geographical location information collected in real-time during the learning process. By introducing the concept of virtual roles for data categorization and designing a learning data distribution mechanism, UPOD allows users to customize the allocation of data to different virtual roles and decide freely whether to share this data with third parties. We further developed a prototype to evaluate the architecture we proposed. The experimental results confirmed the architecture's feasibility and demonstrated its ability to enrich data for lifelong learning records and personalized learning services.},

abstract = {This study proposes an intelligent martial arts coaching system based on artificial intelligence and big data analysis, aimed at enhancing personalized martial arts training outcomes. Traditional martial arts training methods often lack specificity, potentially leading to slow skill improvement and an increased risk of injury. The intelligent coaching system designed in this paper collects real-time physical data of practitioners through sensors and uses deep learning algorithms to generate personalized training programs, dynamically adjusting training intensity and movement rhythm. In the experiment, 30 martial arts practitioners were divided into an experimental group and a control group, with the experimental group using the intelligent coaching system and the control group following traditional training methods. The results show that the experimental group improved endurance, strength, and flexibility by 15%, 10%, and 12%, respectively, significantly higher than the control group's 8%, 6%, and 5%. Additionally, the experimental group's training satisfaction was significantly higher, and the injury rate was significantly lower (6.67% vs. 26.67%). These results indicate that the intelligent martial arts coaching system offers significant advantages in skill enhancement, fatigue reduction, and injury prevention, demonstrating its broad application potential in personalized martial arts training.},

abstract = {This white paper lays out a vision of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for the next decade (and beyond). Its denouement is a cyber-physical ecosystem of natural and synthetic sense-making, in which humans are integral participants—what we call “shared intelligence.” This vision is premised on active inference, a formulation of adaptive behavior that can be read as a physics of intelligence, and which inherits from the physics of self-organization. In this context, we understand intelligence as the capacity to accumulate evidence for a generative model of one’s sensed world—also known as self-evidencing. Formally, this corresponds to maximizing (Bayesian) model evidence, via belief updating over several scales, that is, inference, learning, and model selection. Operationally, this self-evidencing can be realized via (variational) message passing or belief propagation on a factor graph. Crucially, active inference foregrounds an existential imperative of intelligent systems; namely, curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty. This same imperative underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents, in which certain aspects (i.e., factors) of each agent’s generative world model provide a common ground or frame of reference. Active inference plays a foundational role in this ecology of belief sharing—leading to a formal account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals. We also consider the kinds of communication protocols that must be developed to enable such an ecosystem of intelligences and motivate the development of a shared hyper-spatial modeling language and transaction protocol, as a first—and key—step towards such an ecology.},

While there is a well-established body of research on feedback, new advances in technology have led to new methods for developing feedback and large-scale usage provides new data for understanding how feedback impacts learners. This paper focuses on feedback that was developed using artificial intelligence for an automatic question generation system. The automatically generated questions were placed alongside text as a formative learning tool in an e-reader platform. Three types of feedback were randomized across the questions: outcome feedback, context feedback, and common answer feedback. In this study, we investigate the effect of different feedback types on student behavior. This analysis is significant to the expanding body of research on automatic question generation, as little research has been reported on automatically generated feedback specifically, as well as the additional insights that microlevel data can reveal on the relationship between feedback and student learning behaviors.},

However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms ‘human-centered artificial intelligence’ or ‘human-centered machine learning’ or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.},

abstract = {The artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) is an emerging technology that enables numerous AIoT devices to participate in big data analytics and machine learning (ML) model training, providing various customized intelligent services for industry manufacturing. Federated learning (FL) empowers AIoT applications with privacy-preserving distributed model training without sharing raw data. However, due to IoT devices’ limited computing and memory resources, existing FL approaches for AIoT applications cannot support efficient large-scale model training. Federated synergy learning (FSyL) is a promising collaborative paradigm that alleviates the computation and communication overhead on resource-constrained AIoT devices via offloading part of the ML model to the edge server for end-to-edge collaborative training. Existing FSyL works neither efficiently address the inter-round device selection to improve model diversity nor determine the intra-round edge association to reduce the training cost, which hinders the applications of FSyL-enable AIoT. Motivated by this issue, this article first investigates the bottlenecks of executing FSyL in AIoT. It builds an optimization model of joint inter-round device selection and intra-round edge association for balancing model diversity and training cost. To tackle the intractable coupling problem, we present a framework named Online DEvice SelectIon and EdGe AssociatioN for Cost-Diversity Tradeoffs FSyL (DESIGN). First, the edge association subproblem is extracted from the original problem, and game theory determines the optimal association decision for an arbitrary device selection. Then, based on the optimal association decision, device selection is modeled as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Finally, we propose an online mechanism to obtain joint DESIGN decisions. The performance of DESIGN is theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated on real-world datasets. The results show that DESIGN can achieve up to  (84.3%)  in cost-saving with an accuracy improvement of  (23.6%)  compared with the state-of-the-art.},

Due to its rapid growth and impact on several communities in thepast two decades, there is a need to better understand the space of these SWeML Systems, their characteristics, and trends. Yet, surveys that adopt principled and unbiased approaches are missing. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic study and analyzed nearly 500 papers published in the past decade in this area, where we focused on evaluating architectural and application-specific features. Our analysis identified a rapidly growing interest in SWeML Systems, with a high impact on several application domains and tasks. Catalysts for this rapid growth are the increased application of deep learning and knowledge graph technologies. By leveraging the in-depth understanding of this area acquired through this study, a further key contribution of this article is a classification system for SWeML Systems that we publish as ontology.},

After singing a take of a song, I watched as an engineer opened a plug-in called Auto-tune and then listened as he worked on tuning my vocals. I recall him explaining to me that the vocal had to be pretty close to the note I was trying to sing, otherwise the tuned version would sound fake. He demonstrated by tuning my vocal too sharp and then too flat. The sound of the stressed vocal created a distorted tremolo effect, with maybe even a bit of delay. It no longer sounded like me. It sounded like a robot who was impersonating me. I bristled. "No, not like that," I said uncomfortably laughing. "That doesn't sound like me."},

In practice, healthcare organisations increasingly ask patients to remind healthcare workers to perform hand hygiene, which then improves the hand hygiene compliance rate of healthcare workers. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach and found that patient education significantly increases patients’ willingness to participate. However, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this process remains understudied. Concurrently, extant studies have yet to reveal the mechanism between patient education and patients' willingness to participate. Based on role stress theory, we conducted two scenario experiments and proved that AI patient education can significantly improve patients' willingness to participate in hand hygiene, while role ambiguity, role overload and role conflict play a mediating role in this process. Our findings have implications for research and practice that can help promote patient participation in hand hygiene.},

We argue that when co-design spaces forefront relational development, expansive technological objects emerge as a byproduct. We present a case study of expansive dreaming with U.S. historically minoritized students about the use of artificial intelligence to support classroom collaboration. Methodologically, we demonstrate how physically visiting spaces of collective agency serves as a powerful perceptual bridge to imagining joyful, equitable possibilities for schooling. Our approach yields new visions for schooling and new metaphors for artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been growing attention on behalf of both academic and practice communities towards the ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to operate responsibly and ethically. As a result, a plethora of frameworks and guidelines have appeared to support practitioners in implementing Trustworthy AI applications (TAI). However, little research has been done to investigate whether such frameworks are being used and how. In this work, we study the vision AI practitioners have on TAI principles, how they address them, and what they would like to have – in terms of tools, knowledge, or guidelines – when they attempt to incorporate such principles into the systems they develop. Through a survey and semi-structured interviews, we systematically investigated practitioners’ challenges and needs in developing TAI systems. Based on these practical findings, we highlight recommendations to help AI practitioners develop Trustworthy AI applications.},

abstract = {Rather than using AI to make art that imitates the work of human artists, we aim to design machines to support human artists in their creative work. However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks. This is a step towards bringing generative artificial intelligence into the messy complexity of physically embodied creative practice.},

The current literature lacks systematic models that guide the design and evaluation of HI systems. Further, discussions around HI primarily focus on technology, neglecting the holistic human-AI ensemble. In this paper, we take the initial steps toward the development of a quality model for characterizing and evaluating HI systems from a human-AI teams perspective. We conducted a study investigating the adequacy of properties commonly associated with effective human teams to describe HI. Our study, featuring the insights of 50 HI researchers, shows that various human team properties, including boundedness, interdependence, competency, purposefulness, initiative, normativity, and effectiveness, are important for HI systems. Our study also reveals limitations in applying certain human team properties, such as coaching, rewards, and recognition, to HI systems due to the inherent human-AI asymmetry.},

Consequently, online, educational platforms are expected to provide personalized, up-to-date curricula to assist learners. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Crowdsourcing based approach to create and update curricula for individual learners. We show the design of this curriculum development system prototype, in which contributors receive AI-based recommendations to be able to define and update high-level learning goals, skills, and learning topics together with associated learning content. This curriculum development system was also integrated into our personalized online learning platform. To evaluate our prototype we compared experts’ opinion with our system’s recommendations, and resulted in 89%, 79%, and 93% F1-scores when recommending skills, learning topics, and educational materials respectively. Also, we interviewed eight senior level experts from educational institutions and career consulting organizations. Interviewees agreed that our curriculum development method has high potential to support authoring activities in dynamic, personalized learning environments.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore the application effects of learning path recommendation in skill development among vocational college students. By integrating vocational education and artificial intelligence technology, a personalized learning path recommendation model is designed, and a corresponding recommendation system is developed. Student information is collected, and competency assessments are conducted to provide accurate learning path recommendations. Students can choose suitable learning resources and courses based on their individual needs and learning progress. The introduction of personalized learning path recommendation has a positive impact on students' skill development. The learning path recommendation system provides personalized learning support to students, enhancing learning outcomes and motivation. By selecting appropriate learning resources and courses, students can apply their acquired knowledge to real-world scenarios, improving their problem-solving abilities and professional competence. Learning path recommendation holds significant application value in skill development among vocational college students. The personalized learning path recommendation system facilitates students' autonomous learning abilities and personal development by providing accurate recommendations on learning resources and courses. Future research can further explore the precision and flexibility of learning path recommendation systems, as well as their integration with practical projects and real-life cases, to further enhance skill development among vocational college students. The application of learning path recommendation systems will provide vocational colleges with more effective educational tools, assisting students in achieving personal development and professional success.},

abstract = {In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled numerous Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. FL offers advantages over traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) by shifting model training to the edge. However, the dynamic nature of IoT environments often interferes with FL’s ability to converge quickly and deliver consistent performance. Therefore, a self-adaptive approach is necessary to react to context changes and maintain system performance. This paper provides a systematic overview of current efforts to integrate self-adaptation in FL for IoT. We review key computing disciplines, including Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS), Feedback Controls, IoT, and FL. Additionally, we present (i) a multidimensional taxonomy to highlight the core characteristics of self-adaptive FL systems and (ii) a conceptual architecture for self-adaptive FL in IoT, applied to Anomaly Detection (AD) in smart homes. Finally, we discuss the motivations, implementations, applications, and challenges of self-adaptive FL systems in IoT contexts.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, with the potential to revolutionize teaching, learning, and school administration. However, the successful implementation of AI-driven initiatives involves more than simply adopting new technology but requires a thorough understanding of how school leaders perceive AI and their preparedness to integrate it into educational planning and practices. Principals and school leaders play a critical role in supporting effective instruction and student achievement across different content areas, but their needs and challenges, particularly regarding AI integration, are often overlooked. Understanding school leaders' perceptions of AI is vital for successfully implementing AI in schools. This exploratory study employed a qualitative approach to investigate school leaders' perspectives on AI integration in K-12 school settings. Two 90-minute semi-structured focus groups were conducted. Inductive analysis was performed to interpret the qualitative data. The findings highlighted school leaders' perceptions of best practices of AI integration as well as their concerns about AI and the associated ethical dilemma. This collective knowledge of potential solutions for AI integration can help establish a systematic, top-down approach in K-12 school settings.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing rapidly in our society and is now apparent in our day-to-day lives. With the recent burst of interest in AI, many individuals and children may view AI as something mystic and magical. It is important to demystify and introduce to them how AI is made and works. To address this need, we developed a software application that allows children to specify the parameters used by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Then students experience how RL is used to train an AI model to play the game "Snake." This software tool was tested with 71 middle school-age students. Here, we describe the design of the TrainYourSnakeAI application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to middle school children, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. We surveyed their knowledge of AI before and after using the application. In this work, our research questions were: (RQ1) How can we create an engaging tool to teach reinforcement learning? and (RQ2) Does using our application foster a stronger understanding of reinforcement learning in children? Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of reward functions and how agents can learn from the environment using the concept of RL. We found that out of the 51 students who were not previously familiar with RL, 40 were able to provide adequate descriptions of RL after using TrainYourSnakeAI.},

However, mental disorders are still complex to diagnose due to similar and common symptoms for numerous mental illnesses, with a minute difference. Intelligent systems can help us identify mental diseases precisely, which is a critical step in diagnosing. Using these systems efficiently can improve the treatment and rapid recovery of patients. We survey different artificial intelligence systems used in mental healthcare, such as mobile applications, machine learning and deep learning methods, and multi-modal systems and draw comparisons from recent developments and related challenges.

abstract = {Currently, there are issues in the implementation of blended teaching in China, such as significant disconnection between offline and online teaching, insufficient emotional communication in blended teaching, and limited application of artificial intelligence-assisted teaching systems. This study explores international AI-based blended teaching technologies and proposes a framework for enhancing the entire digital capability of blended teaching based on artificial intelligence. With the digital knowledge graph as the core, the paper elaborates on the integration of digital capabilities throughout the process, focusing on aspects like smart classrooms, teaching research platforms, and classroom interaction. This includes precise evaluation of AI applications in online teaching platforms, refining the online-offline connection mechanism using knowledge graphs, utilizing AI to organize micro-course knowledge points into cognitive chains, and enhancing the precision of blended courses with AI in offline smart classrooms. Integrating artificial intelligence into teaching can facilitate the development of personalized teaching resources, promote interactive and emotionally rich teaching, integrate classroom teaching with online learning, and continuously optimize blended courses. This model was put into practice in the "Purchasing and Supply Management" course of Shanghai Normal University Tianhua College in 2023, further proving its potential in improving students' independent learning abilities.},

In a two-week workshop, 13 youth (ages 14-15) designed and audited ML-powered applications. We analyzed pre/post clinical interviews in which youth were presented with auditing tasks. The analyses show that after the workshop all youth identified algorithmic biases and inferred dataset and model design issues. Youth also discussed algorithmic justice issues and ML model improvements. Furthermore, youth reflected that auditing provided them new perspectives on model functionality and ideas to improve their own models. This work contributes (1) a conceptualization of algorithm auditing for youth; and (2) empirical evidence of the potential benefits of auditing.

This study examines usage, resilience, and agility in conversational AI. Based on the experience of 132 organizational information personnel, this study used questionnaires, surveys, and statistical analysis. The results show that conversational AI use is related to organizational agility. This dynamic capability will be related to organizational resilience. In conversational artificial intelligence, dynamic capabilities theory can be applied. High organizational resilience will allow organizations to respond quickly to needs when using conversational artificial intelligence.

abstract = {Latest technological innovations like Cloud-based mobile technologies and virtual and Augmented Reality (AR) have the ability to create great learning experiences. However, few researches exist regarding how AR can be utilized and integrated to complement learning. Currently, the existing research focuses on integrating AR in classes to aid students but few dwells on integrating AR in online learning platforms applications. The increased use of mobile devices has allowed the introduction of online learning management systems that allow people to access e-books, papers, and articles online. As technological inventions continue to emerge, there is a need to investigate and internalize how these new technologies can complement learning. In this research, we investigate how the integration of VR and AR and Cloud-based mobile technologies can improve learning in Australian Higher Education. We conduct a survey to determine how the integration of AR and artificial in the Moodle learning management system can impact the user experiences. We then discuss the current development in virtual and AR and Cloud-based mobile technologies in the education system through a literature review. Our preliminary analysis shows that integration of AR and artificial intelligence may lead to better learning experiences.},

With the advancement of science and technology, the new-generation information technology represented by “Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of Things, Mobile Network, and Artificial Intelligence” has been profoundly changing the form of education, accelerating the transformation from Teaching 1.0 to Learning 2.0. To investigate the factors influencing university students using a new-generation information technology in intelligent foreign language learning, this study proposed a research model based on Technology Acceptance Model. The sample data were collected from a survey of 237 students at a university. The analysis of structural equation modeling indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, construction of foreign language intelligence classroom, and computer self-efficacy all have a positive impact on learners’ behavioral intention. These findings suggest that more emphasis should be laid on students’ learning characteristics, advantages of a new generation of technology, as well as teachers’ intelligent literacy, to further promote the deep integration of the new-generation information technology and intelligent foreign language learning, improving the learning effectiveness ultimately and effectively.},

While children's interactive partners have traditionally been their parents and teachers, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked a surge of AI-based storytelling and reading technologies. As these technologies become increasingly ubiquitous in preschoolers' lives, questions arise regarding how they function in practical storytelling and reading scenarios and, how parents, the most critical stakeholders, experience and perceive these technologies. This paper investigates these questions through a qualitative study with 17 parents of children aged 3-6. Our findings suggest that even though AI-based storytelling and reading technologies provide more immersive and engaging interaction, they still cannot meet parents' expectations due to a series of interactive and algorithmic challenges. We elaborate on these challenges and discuss the possible implications of future AI-based interactive storytelling technologies for preschoolers.},

abstract = {Context: Measuring user satisfaction is an essential tool to create value in digital transformation. Measurement allows you to identify future purchase intentions, user loyalty, and retention. The traditional way of measuring satisfaction using self-assessment has problems, such as subjectivity. Therefore, a more objective approach is needed that allows automatic measurement of satisfaction. Objective: This research aims to make a systematic literature mapping (SLM) to identify the state-of-the-art use of Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques related to emotion recognition visually and then use the results to propose a model that can lead to an automated user satisfaction measurement. We present the model with a work process, an exploratory experiment, and an application project to measure the user experience from visual emotion recognition, automatically calculate the satisfaction assessment of a user when using a digital product, and present the positive, neutral, and negative points of using this product. Methods: A systematic literature mapping was used to identify the primary studies related to techniques, benefits, and challenges that associate the measurement of user satisfaction through the recognition of emotions with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the proposed model, an experiment was planned in two phases to validate research hypotheses related to the objective of the work. The experiment, which will apply the projected application, will be carried out by videoconferencing with the approach of exploratory usability testing on a web product. Results: 10 primary studies were identified in different areas of knowledge: restaurants, television systems, retail stores, artistic shows, and usability testing in a call center system. Two systematic reviews of the literature were also identified. The technique most commonly used in primary studies is the convolutional neural network (CNN). The use of cloud services for emotion recognition was also verified. Benefits related to user feedback, such as user profile mapping, were reported, and challenges for emotion recognition were found, such as user privacy and capture environment inadequacies. Besides, a model to automatically measure user satisfaction in a scalable and replicable way was proposed. Conclusions: The possibilities of applying emotion recognition are countless in terms of contexts, techniques, forms, and components. Despite this, it was possible to identify good practices that could guide the creation of a tool to measure the satisfaction of using a digital product through emotion recognition and Artificial Intelligence. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a model that guides the creation of an automatic satisfaction measurement tool to identify positive, neutral, and negative points in the use of a digital product. This research also defines a measurement experimentation process that any organization or researcher can reproduce.},

AI’s widespread impact is revolutionizing virtually all aspects of human life, and software engineering (SE) is no exception. As we explore this changing landscape, we are faced with questions about what the future holds for SE and how AI will reshape the roles, duties, and methodologies within the field. The introduction of these groundbreaking technologies highlights the inevitable shift towards a new paradigm, suggesting a future where AI’s capabilities may redefine the boundaries of SE, potentially even more than human input.In this paper, we aim at outlining the key elements that, based on our expertise, are vital for the smooth integration of AI into SE, all while preserving the intrinsic human creativity that has been the driving force behind the field. First, we provide a brief description of SE and AI evolution. Afterward, we delve into the intricate interplay between AI-driven automation and human innovation, exploring how these two components can work together to advance SE practices to new methods and standards.},

abstract = {Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aviation safety, particularly during takeoff and landing, when aircraft are most vulnerable. Our project develops a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system using the YOLOv8 model to address this critical issue. The system is focused on detecting and calculating the distance of birds within airport environments and along flight paths. By training the model with a comprehensive dataset, our technology achieves exceptional accuracy in real-time bird detection. Integrated with webcam technology, it provides instant, actionable insights into avian activity, enhancing safety measures in and around airfields. This innovation not only promises to revolutionize the way aviation personnel monitor and manage airspace for safety but also paves the way for implementing AI-based solutions in mitigating natural hazards in aviation. Our project underscores the potential of integrating machine learning with aviation operations to proactively address safety concerns, ensuring a safer flying experience. Through this technological advancement, we aim to set new benchmarks in aviation safety, offering a model that could be adapted across global aviation sectors to safeguard against the perennial challenge of bird strikes.},

abstract = {Lights out! With the escalating climate crisis, eco-feedback has gained prominence over the last decade. However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user’s energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) continues its unprecedented global expansion, accompanied by a proliferation of benefits, an increasing apprehension about the privacy and security implications of AI-enabled systems emerges. The pivotal question of effectively controlling AI development at both jurisdictional and organizational levels has become a prominent theme in contemporary discourse. While the European Commission has taken a decisive step by reaching a political agreement on the EU AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive AI law, organizations still find it challenging to adapt to the fast-evolving AI landscape, lacking a universal tool for evaluating the privacy and security dimensions of their AI models and systems. In response to this challenge, this study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) with a primary focus on establishing a unified definition of key concepts in AI Ethics, particularly emphasizing the domains of privacy and security. Through the synthesis of knowledge extracted from the SLR, this study presents a conceptual framework tailored for privacy- and security-aware AI systems. This framework is designed to assist diverse stakeholders, including organizations, academic institutions, and governmental bodies, in the development and critical assessment of AI systems. Essentially, the proposed framework serves as a guide for ethical decision-making, fostering an environment wherein AI is developed and utilized with a strong commitment to ethical principles. In addition, the study unravels the key issues and challenges surrounding the privacy and security dimensions, delineating promising avenues for future research, thereby contributing to the ongoing dialogue on the globalization and democratization of AI ethics.},

At the same time, the safety of FMCG is directly related to the life and health of the people. Therefore, the establishment of FMCG anti-counterfeiting and traceability system is urgent. Machine vision is used to collect the microscopic features of two-dimensional code (points, edges, lines, curves, etc.) and form the microscopic feature code. The feature points are extracted by Hessian algorithm, and then the extracted feature points are rotated, scaled, enhanced and restored by Fourier algorithm, etc. Establish a multi-level classification model of deep learning combined with support vector machine, and use convolutional structure neural network learning mode to achieve the ultimate recognition training of micro-features at all dimensional levels, realize new anti-counterfeit, and establish a big data system of FMCG traceability and consumption information based on deep learning, which can enhance consumers' trust in the quality and safety of FMCG and improve the added value of FMCG. Promote the transformation and upgrading of the entire industrial chain and consumption chain of FMCG, and promote the healthy and rapid development of the FMCG industry.},

abstract = {Machine Learning is widely used by practitioners to solve complex challenges. However, despite being trusted by 76% of the public, scientists struggle to explain the rationale behind machine learning-based decisions. This is concerning because research has shown that people often rely on inaccurate machine learning recommendations, even when the system is not confident or they have prior knowledge. To address these issues, there is a crucial need for greater transparency and education around machine learning decision making. In this work, we propose a set of guidelines and design implications to communicate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence models to the general audience. We do this through a literature review of the latest and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods and validate these insights through a user study encompassing the participants’ interpretations of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence solutions. Combining the insights from this mixed-method study, we identify seven main communication guidelines for improving machine learning models understanding. This study contributes to the broader discussion of ethical implications surrounding opaque machine learning models in decision-making. Through the development of guidelines, we hope to bridge the gap between machine learning experts and the public, enabling a better common understanding of its increasing importance in our lives.},

In this case study, we test a ground-up approach to ensuring better real-world algorithmic transparency by creating transparency influencers — motivated individuals within organizations who advocate for transparency. We held an interactive online workshop on algorithmic transparency and advocacy for 15 professionals from news, media, and journalism. We reflect on workshop design choices and presents insights from participant interviews. We found positive evidence for our approach: In the days following the workshop, three participants had done pro-transparency advocacy. Notably, one of them advocated for algorithmic transparency at an organization-wide AI strategy meeting. In the words of a participant: “if you are questioning whether or not you need to tell people [about AI], you need to tell people.”},

In the second, the regulatory sandbox is presented as a strategic tool to promote multidisciplinary and multistakeholder engagement. To support this argument, the views of authors who were essential for developing concepts of cyberspace regulation and Internet governance will be looked at, such as Lawrence Lessig, Jeanette Hoffman, Andrew Murray, and Julia Black. Finally, the third part focuses on the Brazilian regulatory environment and its maturity for implementing AI regulatory sandboxes. The article concludes by summarizing the lessons that can be retrieved from the theories analysed for the development of regulatory sandboxes for Artificial Intelligence.},

This study proposes a depression detection model based on deep learning, aiming to effectively identify early symptoms of depression by analyzing multidimensional data such as individual behavior patterns, language expression, and physiological indicators. This model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process image data, such as changes in facial expressions; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks process text or speech information to capture dynamic features of emotional fluctuations; Simultaneously combining other machine learning algorithms to process biomarker information such as heart rate variability. Through training and validation on a large-scale clinical dataset, the results show that the model can distinguish depressed patients from non-depressed individuals with high accuracy, providing new tools and technical support for early diagnosis of depression, improving the efficiency of mental health services, and promoting the development of personalized medical plans.

abstract = {While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on students’ learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable insights for educators and researchers alike.},

abstract = {In Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), poor health outcomes come from a high burden of disease, a shortage of healthcare professionals, and inefficient health information exchange leading to substantial economic losses. In this paper, we highlight critical gaps in healthcare delivery in Pakistan and propose solutions to improve patient outcomes in resource-constrained environments. We have built Darcheeni, an AI-driven healthcare framework that leverages artificial intelligence to assist and supplement physicians, streamline healthcare processes, and prioritize patient-centered care. Darcheeni analyzes doctor-patient interactions in real-time, integrates lab and imaging data, generates and distributes care plans customized to the patient’s needs, and sends them directly to patients’ smartphones. We also discuss the challenges and limitations associated with sustainable AI integration by centering our learnings from the pilot deployment of Darcheeni. By focusing on Pakistan as a case study, this work offers practical insights and strategies for deploying AI-driven technologies sustainably in similar resource-constrained environments and contributes to the broader discourse on the role of AI in global health improvement.},

Their expanding use in vital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern. However, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This taxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to ensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and controllability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies, benchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the principal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique challenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the way for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to significant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.},

abstract = {In the ever-expanding landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where innovation thrives and new products and services are continuously being delivered, ensuring that AI systems are designed and developed responsibly throughout their entire lifecycle is crucial. To this end, several AI ethics principles and guidelines have been issued to which AI systems should conform. Nevertheless, relying solely on high-level AI ethics principles is far from sufficient to ensure the responsible engineering of AI systems. In this field, AI professionals often navigate by sight. Indeed, while recommendations promoting Trustworthy AI (TAI) exist, they are often high-level statements difficult to translate into concrete implementation strategies. Currently, there is a significant gap between high-level AI ethics principles and low-level concrete practices for AI professionals. To address this challenge, our work presents an experience report where we develop a novel holistic framework for Trustworthy AI --- designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice --- and report insights from its application in an industrial case study. The framework builds up from the results of a systematic review of the state of the practice as well as a survey and think-aloud interviews with 34 AI practitioners. The framework, unlike most of the ones in literature, is designed to provide actionable guidelines and tools to support different types of stakeholders throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Our goal is to empower AI professionals to confidently navigate the ethical dimensions of TAI through practical insights, ensuring that the vast potential of AI is exploited responsibly for the benefit of society as a whole.},

abstract = {In crisis informatics, little attention is placed on how transitions occur between periods of crisis and non-crisis. The analysis of transition behaviors in public organizations could help in understanding the duality between the need for continuity of services provided to the community, and the cyclical nature of risk and crisis management. This study uniquely highlights the transitions occurring when organizations need to stop day-to-day activities to focus on responding to a crisis while continuing to provide services to their communities. We focus on the use of social media analytics as a support system to study transitions and, with the objective to gain an insight into how sociotechnical systems navigate through periods of crisis and non-crisis, we leverage individual experiences of use of social media as a source of information in public service organizations and developers of social media analytics support tools. In doing so, we employed a process study approach, conducted semi-structured interviews, and used thematic analysis to trace patterns of transitions between crisis and non-crisis states. Furthermore, we formulate five signals that public organizations exhibit to illustrate and guide organizational transition behaviors. The main contribution of this study is the explanation and conceptualization of how transitions happen by framing social media as a support information system. In addition, we highlight the return to a new steady state, an overlooked area of organizational transitions and continuity. Our study will help streamline processes of continuity in organizations and inspires the design and improvement of current and future support systems. Future research could apply and extend our propositions to other support systems such as geospatial technologies, robots, and even artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {DevOps has emerged as one of the most rapidly evolving software development paradigms. With the growing concerns surrounding security in software systems, the DevSecOps paradigm has gained prominence, urging practitioners to incorporate security practices seamlessly into the DevOps workflow. However, integrating security into the DevOps workflow can impact agility and impede delivery speed. Recently, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized automation in various software domains, including software security. AI-driven security approaches, particularly those leveraging machine learning or deep learning, hold promise in automating security workflows. They have the potential to reduce manual efforts and can be incorporated into DevOps practices to support consistent delivery speed while aligning with the principles of the DevSecOps paradigm. This paper seeks to contribute to the critical intersection of AI and DevSecOps by presenting a comprehensive landscape of AI-driven security techniques applicable to DevOps and identifying avenues for enhancing security, trust, and efficiency in software development processes. We analyzed 99 research papers spanning from 2017 to 2023. Specifically, we address two key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we identified 12 security tasks associated with the DevSecOps process and reviewed existing AI-driven security approaches, the problems they addressed, and the 65 benchmarks used to evaluate those approaches. Drawing insights from our findings, in RQ2, we discussed state-of-the-art AI-driven security approaches, highlighted 15 challenges in existing research, and proposed 15 corresponding avenues for future opportunities.},

The present work aims to identify the factors that affect the learning satisfaction of college students and the underlying mechanism of influence from the angle of big data technology and investigate the moderating role of content quality between the students’ self-efficacy and learning satisfaction. Specifically, the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) was employed to establish our study model, and 314 valid questionnaires were collected from college students using the online questionnaire method. The research model was validated using SmartPLS. Modeling and statistical analyses revealed the following insights: first, three factors, that is, the content quality, software quality and interactivity, are found to exert a significant positive effect on the self-efficacy of college students; second, content quality, interactivity and self-efficacy were found to exert significantly positive effects on the learning satisfaction; third, the content quality was found to play a significant moderating role in the relationship between self-efficacy and the students’ learning satisfaction. The research findings are expected to inspire measures to improve the teaching quality of big data analysis courses in universities and boost the advancement of big data technology in China.},

These models, by leveraging the power of deep learning and massive amounts of data, have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to understand, generate, and operate programming languages. They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts.

The paper first summarizes the overall process of LLM4SE, and then elaborates on the current challenges based on a through discussion. The discussion was held among more than 20 participants from academia and industry, specializing in fields such as software engineering and artificial intelligence. Specifically, we achieve 26 key challenges from seven aspects, including software requirement &amp; design, coding assistance, testing code generation, code review, code maintenance, software vulnerability management, and data, training, and evaluation.

We collected survey data from 89 practising visual artists and conducted follow-up interviews with 30 of them, to better understand their diverse needs and values. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we explored visual artists’ attitudes towards collaboration in art creation both with human artists and with AI- and other technology-based support systems. Our results suggest that the focus of popular AI tools on high-quality, finished images does not meet the needs of visual artists. Instead, they wanted reference images, ideation support, and variant exploration. We identified similarities and differences between how visual artists view collaboration with other artists or with machine support, enabling designers of new tools to adopt a more user-centered approach.},

While ChatGPT has the potential to streamline pedagogy and research, it poses a variety of challenges, such as allowing cheating on exams and homework, which puts students’ problem-solving skills at risk. Also, ChatGPT creates text that looks like human text, so cheating can be difficult to detect. In this paper, we explore the potential opportunities of ChatGPT in the education sector, as well as its limitations and challenges.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

abstract = {In this paper we aim to bring some order to the myriad of tools that have emerged in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on the field of Machine Learning (ML). For this purpose, we suggest a classification of the tools in which the categories are organized following the development lifecycle of an ML system and we make a review of the existing tools within each section of the classification. We believe this will help to better understand the ecosystem of tools currently available and will also allow us to identify niches in which to develop new tools to aid in the development of AI and ML systems. After reviewing the state-of-the-art of the tools, we have identified three trends in them: the incorporation of humans into the loop of the machine learning process, the movement from ad-hoc and experimental approaches to a more engineering perspective and the ability to make it easier to develop intelligent systems for people without an educational background in the area, in order to move the focus from the technical environment to the domain-specific problem.},

abstract = {Building on a foundation of innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, this study presents an evolved approach to assessing student class participation (CP) and providing timely feedback in Masters in Business Administration (MBA) programs. This approach has been rigorously applied and analyzed over the course of four academic terms, thereby offering a substantive examination of its effectiveness. The methodological framework of this study is predicated on the utilization of AI transcription tools, such as GRAIN, to convert Zoom session recordings into analyzable text data. This has enabled a consistent and objective evaluation of each student's contributions during class discussions across four subsequent terms. The implementation involved MBA students who shared similar professional backgrounds and demographics, ensuring a consistent context for analysis. AI-generated insights were integrated with a dynamic dashboard, presenting an innovative way to track and assess CP. These insights underwent meticulous annotation and review to guarantee adherence to the educational standards and fairness expected by the institution. The AI's role as an initial assessor was balanced by the professor's final judgement, forming a complementary relationship that enhanced the educational process. This study's findings are particularly noteworthy in the context of teaching quality and effectiveness. Over the four terms of implementation, student evaluations reflected high satisfaction with respect to fairness and respect in grading, the timeliness of feedback, and the adherence to established grading criteria. Notably, the ratings for these specific criteria consistently exceeded the term mean under the category of "Evaluation." This suggests that the AI-augmented approach not only meets but surpasses traditional evaluation methods, aligning with the broader institutional goals of equitable and efficient educational assessment. In synthesizing the outcomes of this extended application, the paper delineates a clear trajectory of improvement in teaching effectiveness as perceived by the students, attributed to the responsible integration of AI in evaluative practices. These findings provide a compelling argument for the continued and expanded use of AI in the pedagogical process, with the potential to redefine the landscape of assessment in professional education.},

abstract = {The success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications is driven by efficient hardware accelerators. Recent trends show a rapid increase in the application demands, which in most cases surpass the available resources in the accelerators. As such, the efficient management of these limited resources becomes a critical factor in achieving high-performance. In this work we focus on the management of the available on-chip memory resources for Deep Learning (DL) accelerators. While most state-of-the-art accelerators have static buffer separation for different data types, we observed that the heterogeneity of recent DL models demands for more flexible solutions. In this work we propose using all on-chip scratchpad memory, including space for double buffering, in a unified way. To efficiently exploit that space, we propose a memory management technique that can apply different policies to best meet the demands of each different execution phase. For cases when the available memory is less than the requirements, the memory management can use the available space for either optimizing the data reuse or the fetching of data ahead. Comparing our approach against a baseline accelerator shows that the flexibility in the management of the scratchpad memory leads to a considerable reduction of up to 80% of the off-chip memory accesses, or up to 56% of the latency.},

With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, the integration of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) into writing education provides a novel solution to these issues. This study explores the application of a CV- and NLP-based intelligent writing assistance system in vocational English writing education. The system enhances grammar correction, semantic understanding, and automated feedback, significantly improving students' writing performance while reducing teachers' workload. An experimental evaluation demonstrated that the system effectively improved writing accuracy, logical clarity, and overall learning efficiency.

Gregg Shorthand in stenography is the art of writing in shorthand or using specialized symbols and abbreviations. The project aims to investigate the many uses of image processing in steganography. The research utilizes a descriptive-developmental research design. Specifically, supervised machine learning methods, particularly k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), detect and convert handwritten Gregg shorthand symbols into readable Latin letters. The dataset consists of forty-eight images. The result suggested that k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) works well in identifying images with a precision performance of 86% and overall performance using the ISO 25010 of 4.17 interpreted as the system is very usable.},

This survey contributes to the discourse by outlining the current understanding of trustworthiness and its evaluation. Initially, existing evaluation frameworks are analyzed, from which common dimensions of trustworthiness are derived. For each dimension, the literature is surveyed for evaluation strategies, specifically focusing on quantitative metrics. By mapping these strategies to the machine learning lifecycle, an evaluation framework is derived, which can serve as a foundation towards the operationalization of Trustworthy AI.},

This paper explores the usability and trustworthiness of an AI-driven CDSS designed to assist ophthalmologists in treating diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, we created a CDSS and evaluated its impact on efficiency, informedness, and user experience through task-based semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with 11 ophthalmologists. The usability of the CDSS was rated highly, with a SUS of 81.75. Additionally, results show that participants felt like the CDSS would improve their efficiency and informedness with one major aspect being integrating Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data into a single interface. Additionally, we explored aspects of the trustworthiness of AI components, specifically OCT segmentation, treatment recommendation, and visual acuity forecasting. Through thematic analysis, we identified key factors influencing trustworthiness and clinical adoption. Results show that a larger degree of abstraction from input to output of a model correlates with decreased trust. From our findings, we propose three guidelines for designing trustworthy CDSS.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused several changes in daily habits and routines. Among all, education faced this problem by massively adopting remote teaching. Despite this constituted, in the initial moment, a wall to climb, several universities keep delivering online or hybrid courses, with the aim of leveraging the benefits of such an approach. On this line, the Bachelor’s degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) has broadened its curriculum with the introduction of “Ethics, Law and Privacy in Data and Analytics” as a mandatory module in the fifth semester. This innovative teaching project, piloted during the academic year 2022/2023, tackled the pedagogical challenge of integrating a multidisciplinary subject into the largely technical field of Data Science and AI. Recognizing the necessity for expertise beyond the Department of Innovative Technologies (DTI), the module was conducted entirely in English and leveraged online delivery to incorporate a diverse range of international specialists in ethics, law, and relevant technology fields. This poster details the module’s structure, highlighting the inclusion of global perspectives to avoid the limitations of a Swiss-centric view and prepare students for a universal professional environment. It also explores the logistics and pedagogical strategies employed to navigate the complexities of online learning, such as interactive lectures, case studies, role-plays, and flipped classroom sessions.},

abstract = {Uncovering algorithmic bias related to sensitive attributes is crucial. However, understanding the underlying causes of bias is even more important to ensure fairer outcomes. This study investigates bias associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in a machine learning model predicting students’ test scores. While fairness metrics did not reveal significant bias, potential subtle bias indicated by variations in model performance for students with ADHD was observed. To uncover causes of this potential bias, we correlated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values with the model’s prediction errors, identifying the features most strongly associated with increasing prediction errors. Behavioral and self-reported survey features designed to measure students’ use of effective learning strategies were identified as potential causes of the model underestimating test grades for students with ADHD. Behavioral features had a stronger correlation between absolute SHAP values and prediction errors (up to r =.354, p =.013) for students with ADHD than for those without ADHD. Students with ADHD often use unique yet effective approaches to studying in online learning environments—approaches that may not be fully captured by traditional measures of typical student behaviors. These insights suggest adjusting feature design to better account for students with ADHD and mitigate bias.},

Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a model that was trained on a sizable dataset of both honest and dishonest credit card transactions are the main parts of our system. While the machine learning model is built to identify anomalies and patterns suggestive of fraud, feature engineering works on extracting relevant information from transaction data. By implementing retraining processes and keeping an eye on developing patterns, the system continuously adjusts to new fraud strategies.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in creating Learning Analytics (LA) systems that incorporate student perspectives. Yet, many LA systems still lean towards a technology-centric approach, potentially overlooking human values and the necessity of human oversight in automation. Although some recent LA studies have adopted a human-centred design stance, there is still limited research on establishing safe, reliable, and trustworthy systems during the early stages of LA design. Drawing from a newly proposed framework for human-centred artificial intelligence, we introduce SLADE, a method for ideating and identifying features of human-centred LA systems that balance human control and computer automation. We illustrate SLADE’s application in designing LA systems to support collaborative learning in healthcare. Twenty-one third-year students participated in design sessions through SLADE’s four steps: i) identifying challenges and corresponding LA systems; ii) prioritising these LA systems; iii) ideating human control and automation features; and iv) refining features emphasising safety, reliability, and trustworthiness. Our results demonstrate SLADE’s potential to assist researchers and designers in: 1) aligning authentic student challenges with LA systems through both divergent ideation and convergent prioritisation; 2) understanding students’ perspectives on personal agency and delegation to teachers; and 3) fostering discussions about the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LA solutions.},

abstract = {Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) is widely considered as one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. In addition, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm level rather than system level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize RAI from a system perspective, in this article, we present an RAI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a multivocal literature review. Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The RAI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and RAI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement RAI.},

abstract = {The more the economy develops, the more important accounting is. As artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the economy continue to advance swiftly, the accounting industry is undergoing unprecedented changes, and The dynamic advancement of the economy is inextricably linked to the ongoing evolution and comprehensive reform of accounting practices. In the context of globalization and digitalization, accounting work is undergoing a significant transformation through technological innovation, with the aim of enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making processes. Concurrently, improvements in the system and the adoption of international standards have contributed to greater transparency and comparability in accounting information, providing a powerful stimulus for economic growth. Collectively, these developments have facilitated the optimization of the economic structure and the integration of global markets, ensuring the sustained advancement of economic activities. For instance, the application of AI technology in automation, data analysis and risk management has greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy of accounting work. Taking a private university in Guangdong Province, this study employs a methodology that integrates theoretical frameworks with experimental approaches, introduces the relevant basic theories of this paper, and then makes a systematic comparative analysis by collecting relevant classroom teaching data through research. This study examines the tailored learning approach within the context of intelligent classroom environments in accounting education, and giving full play to the effectiveness of accounting intelligent classroom learning. Through empirical investigation, the impact of neural network technology in accounting classroom is verified. The findings of the experimental study indicate that the mean score of the network-based intelligent learning class is 6 points higher than that of the traditional classroom, reaching 76 points. This evidence substantiates the significant impact of an intelligent learning environment on enhancing teaching quality and facilitating personalized learning, while providing robust support for educational innovation and interactive learning environment, which is very helpful for accounting students to improve their professional knowledge and practical ability. The exploration of intelligent learning in accounting class based on neural network technology model provides new ideas and methods for accounting education and helps to promote the development and progress of accounting education.},

This paper proposes a novel EHR architecture suitable for developing countries—an architecture that fosters inclusion and provides solutions tailored to all social classes and socioeconomic statuses. Our architecture foresees an internet-free (offline) solution to allow medical transactions between healthcare organizations, and the storage of EHRs in geographically underserved and rural areas. Moreover, we discuss how artificial intelligence can leverage anonymous health-related information to enable better public health policy and surveillance.},

abstract = {Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained widespread popularity across different fields, it is essential to recognize that AI systems, while impressive, do not consistently exhibit robust generalization, particularly for difficult problems such as the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). In this study, we focus on bridging this performance gap by integrating human solutions into AI training. To illustrate these principles, we leverage data from Borderlands Science, a popular citizen science game in which small instances of the MSA problem are represented as puzzles. Our goal is to leverage the collective intelligence of human players to enhance the capabilities of AI agents. To achieve this, we have developed a Player-guided AI system that enables the AI model to learn from both standard training processes and the solutions provided by players. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating human-annotated information into the AI model improves its performance on puzzle tasks. Furthermore, the Player-guided AI model shows a decrease in noise compared to a pure AI model. This advancement allows for leveraging the model to align new sequences with improved accuracy and effectiveness. Moreover, this research brings attention to the potential of integrating AI and human expertise to address other challenges where the performance of AI models may be unsatisfactory.},

Recent rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) provide us with new tools for reducing the cost of numerical simulations. The application of these tools to atmospheric chemistry is still somewhat nascent and multiple challenges remain due to the reaction complexities and the high number of chemical species. In this work, we present GAIA-Chem, a global AI-accelerated atmospheric chemistry framework for large-scale, multi-fidelity, data-driven chemical simulations. GAIA-Chem provides an environment for testing different approaches to data-driven species simulation. GAIA-Chem includes curated training and validation datasets, support for offline and online training schemes, and comprehensive metrics for model intercomparison. We use GAIA-Chem to evaluate two Deep Neural Network (DNN) models: a standard autoencoder scheme based on convolutional LSTM nodes, and a transformer-based model. We show computational speedups of 1,280x over numerical methods for the chemical solver and a 2.8x reduction in RMSE when compared to previous works.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to predict students' final achievement based on their ongoing engagement and formative assessment results within learning management systems (LMSs). This study incorporates ongoing assessment performance as a key factor in measuring student engagement and predicting final exam performance. The results indicate that in the blended teaching process, firstly, including ongoing engagement activities in the final assessment has a positive effect on final exam scores. Secondly, the predictive effect of multiple continuous tasks is superior to that of a single continuous task, and ongoing engagement activities are better predictors of final exam scores than formative assessments. Thirdly, using a standard level as a reference for prediction yields relatively high accuracy, while using an average level as a reference can better identify at-risk students. Therefore, it is recommended that instructors comprehensively incorporate continuous tasks that can reflect students' engagement into the final assessment in blended courses.},

abstract = {Human participants play a central role in the development of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology, in psychological science, and in user research. Recent advances in generative AI have attracted growing interest to the possibility of replacing human participants in these domains with AI surrogates. We survey several such “substitution proposals” to better understand the arguments for and against substituting human participants with modern generative AI. Our scoping review indicates that the recent wave of these proposals is motivated by goals such as reducing the costs of research and development work and increasing the diversity of collected data. However, these proposals ignore and ultimately conflict with foundational values of work with human participants: representation, inclusion, and understanding. This paper critically examines the principles and goals underlying human participation to help chart out paths for future work that truly centers and empowers participants.},

Record numbers of jobs previously held by people have been automated, from manufacturing to transportation to customer services. The concerns of AI replacing humans by taking over people's jobs need to be urgently addressed. This article investigates some promising different directions of AI development: Instead of using AI to replace people, we should use AI to team up with people so that both can work better and smarter. Human–AI symbiosis refers to people and AI working together to jointly solve problems and perform specific tasks. The recent developments in deep learning models and frameworks have significantly improved the efficiency and performance of human and AI collaborations. In this article, some research work on human–AI collaborative environments has been extensively studied and analyzed to reveal the progress in this field. Although the teaming of humans and machines includes many complex tasks, the development has been very promising. One of the main goals in this field is to develop additional capabilities in machines capable of being successful teammates with a human partner. The correctness of the outcomes is often determined by the underlying technology and how performance and human satisfaction are measured through the collaborative nature of the system. We conclude that the teaming of humans and AI, particularly deep learning, has the advantage of combining the power of AI with the human domain expertise to improve performance and create value. Human–AI symbiosis could be a promising future direction for AI's continuing integration into the world.},

The potential of AI-driven tools in enhancing the learning experience, especially in programming, is immense. However, the scientific evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) used in Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) as an AI-Tutor remains largely unexplored. Therefore, there is a need to understand how students interact with such AI-Tutors and to analyze their experiences.In this paper, we conducted an exploratory case study by integrating the GPT-3.5-Turbo model as an AI-Tutor within the APAS Artemis. Through a combination of empirical data collection and an exploratory survey, we identified different user types based on their interaction patterns with the AI-Tutor. Additionally, the findings highlight advantages, such as timely feedback and scalability. However, challenges like generic responses and students' concerns about a learning progress inhibition when using the AI-Tutor were also evident.

abstract = {Based on the theory of intelligent perception and deep learning, this paper discusses the interactive design method of virtual reality (VR) platform based on artificial intelligence, and carries out in-depth analysis of its modeling and evaluation process. The research shows that the multi-user collaborative recommendation algorithm can effectively reduce the concurrency of users in the interactive system. At the same time, the deep learning algorithm model can predict the data flow and feature information in the virtual reality scene, and the performance results are obtained through iterative operations. The results show that the initial stability of the system is about 90%, and the fluctuation range is between 80% and 100% as time goes by. Under the premise of maintaining stability of 80% to 100%, small vibration caused by random noise leads to stability fluctuations. The system shows a certain degree of robustness and elasticity in the fluctuation range of 80% to 100%, and can maintain stability in response to external interference, and realize functions such as intelligent roaming and environmental monitoring of the VR platform.},

Distinguished from pragmatic and referential semantics, linguistic semantics have not yet been completely formalized. Only its syntagmatic dimension has been mathematized in the form of regular languages. Its paradigmatic dimension remained to be formalized. In order to complete the mathematizing of language, including its paradigmatic dimension, I have coded linguistic semantics with IEML. This article introduces its 3000-word dictionary, its formal grammar, and its integrated tools for building semantic graphs. For the future, IEML could become a vector for a fluid calculation and communication of meaning—semantic interoperability—capable of de-compartmentalizing the digital memory, and of advancing the progress of collective intelligence, artificial intelligence, and digital humanities. I conclude by indicating some research directions.},

In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.},

abstract = {The digitization of production is an essential component of Industry 4.0. The collection of data in the production process is a decisive factor and a prerequisite for the use of artificial intelligence. At machine level, groundbreaking successes have been achieved in the field of predictive maintenance using machine learning, which is directly reflected in increased productivity and cost savings. In contrast, digitization at item level, i.e. the digital tracking of all items in the process context that ultimately lead to the finished product, is much more complex. A non-structured collection of data at item level prevents the use of artificial intelligence, for example in the quality testing of products. As part of the RECAST project, the extent to which existing non-networked production facilities can be digitized with this objective was investigated. As part of the work, a framework was created using exclusively open source components, which allows a digital representation of various real existing complex production processes in the aerospace industry to be created. With this digital twin, the system data can be recorded in real time on a item-specific basis. Thanks to the generic approach to process mapping, the results can be applied to a wide range of application fields in mechanical engineering and data-intensive administrative tasks.},

abstract = {Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools. With the advent of foundation models, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, which is dubbed as tool learning with foundation models, combines the strengths of tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. This article presents a systematic investigation and comprehensive review of tool learning. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research and formulate a general framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate generalization in tool learning. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation, such as ensuring trustworthy tool use, enabling tool creation with foundation models, and addressing personalization challenges. Overall, we hope this article could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid evolution of smart technologies has spurred enterprises to undergo digital transformations, revolutionizing their business processes and operations. This shift, known as Digital Transformation, has permeated diverse sectors, particularly impacting production systems. Notably, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic automation have emerged as pivotal drivers in this transformation, promising enhanced efficiency and innovation in industrial digitization. This paper presents a novel architecture designed to facilitate digital transformation within enterprises, harnessing the capabilities of advanced collaborative robots (cobots) and cutting-edge image segmentation techniques. Focused on a practical scenario within a food production environment, our proposed architecture aims to seamlessly integrate a cobot and a camera in an automatic system for efficient cardboard disposal. Specifically, our attention is drawn to the challenge of differentiating sections of food packaging suitable for disposal from those contaminated with stains or organic residues, a task with significant implications for waste management efficiency. By leveraging a cloud-based architecture and deploying AI algorithms for image segmentation, localization, and robot guidance, our study showcases the tangible benefits and practical applicability of these methodologies in real-world settings. This research not only highlights the potential of AI-driven solutions in addressing specific industrial challenges but also underscores the broader impact of digital transformation on optimizing operational processes and driving innovation across sectors.},

The questionnaire was planned to measure student satisfaction and dissatisfaction of 12 features related to online course design using the Kano model. The questionnaire also included freeform text comments to gain insight into students’ expectation and consumption experience. A Word2Vec language model was trained on the freeform questions. Keywords related to the 12 online course features were analyzed using the language model. The results substantiate the use of specialized language models to support the Kano model analysis.},

abstract = {In this global health crisis, several efforts have been launched to monitor and control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those efforts require the support of new technologies like the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Image and Video Processing, Big Data, and Machine Learning to tackle various problems related to this viral pandemic. In these circumstances, public places such as hospitals, public transportation, and supermarkets need a more scientific and practical system/guidance to identify the probable COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we design an Internet of Things-Artificial Intelligence IoT-AI based intelligent system to monitor the suspect cases in public places. Based on implicit/Explicit data acquisition flow, the system provides information to public authorities. In a public place, the actions of suspicious people are collected by sensors such as thermal cameras, connected cameras, and Smartphone embedded sensors. Subsequently, this data is sent to the system for analysis. Thanks to artificial intelligence technology, the system can extract useful information to determine suspicious COVID-19 cases. In this article, we will describe the proposed global system. The design of this type of system is a trend for the future wider application to deal with COVID-19.},

abstract = {Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) expands traditional learning analytics into the digital and physical learning environment, using diverse sensors and systems to collect information about education in more real-world environments. Challenges remain in making these technologies practical for capturing data in authentic learning situations. With the advent of readily accessible powerful artificial intelligence that includes multimodal large language models, new opportunities are available. However, few approaches allow access to these technologies, and most systems are developed for specific environments. Recent work has begun to make toolkits with access to collecting data from sensors, processing, and analyzing, yet these tools are challenging to integrate into a system. This paper introduces OpenMMLA, a toolkit approach that provides programming interfaces for harnessing these technologies into an MMLA platform with prebuilt pipelines, including the audio analyzer, indoor positioning, and video frame analyzer, offering multimodal data collection and visualizations and analytics. The paper provides an initial evaluation of the functionalities of the toolkit in data capturing and the implemented pipelines’ performances.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) can streamline gamification strategies in smart cities by enabling dynamic adjustments to sustain engagement and encourage behavioral change. This work presents an AI-assisted gamification platform, which relies on two core components. The first is a gamification strategy (GS) that focuses on a single rewarded task, making it adaptable for policymakers and practical for adoption. The second is an integrated AI mechanism incorporating a machine learning (ML) model that automatically adjusts gamification rules using Internet of Things (IoT) data and user behavior analysis. These two components are interdependent: the AI mechanism depends on task singularity for transparency, adaptability, and user control, while the single-task GS depends on AI for practicality and long-term flexibility. The strategy centers on positive feedback for rewarding food-related businesses and their employees for adopting a food waste (FW) digestion system at the source, through an interactive platform. A controlled deployment confirmed the system's feasibility and coherence, highlighting its potential for broader adoption in a unified smart city FW management application. This approach focuses on practicality for wider adoption, aiming to promote sustainable behavior and reduce the environmental impact of FW.},

abstract = {Personalized clinical decision support systems are increasingly being adopted due to the emergence of data-driven technologies, with this approach now gaining recognition in critical care. The task of incorporating diverse patient conditions and treatment procedures into critical care decision-making can be challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of medical data. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, enables the development of personalized treatment strategies for severe illnesses by using a learning agent to recommend optimal policies. In this study, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model with a tailored reward function and an LSTM-GRU-derived state representation to formulate optimal treatment policies for vasopressor administration in stabilizing patient physiological states in critical care settings. Using an ICU dataset and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset, we focus on patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that has led to Sepsis, to derive optimal policies that can prioritize patient recovery over patient survival. Both the DDQN (RepDRL-DDQN) and Dueling DDQN (RepDRL-DDDQN) versions of the DRL model surpass the baseline performance, with the proposed model’s learning agent achieving an optimal learning process across our performance measuring schemes. The robust state representation served as the foundation for enhancing the model’s performance, ultimately providing an optimal treatment policy focused on rapid patient recovery.},

In local communities, public libraries are often deemed to have crucial potential in engaging diverse targeted audiences with educational and informational needs. Given this context, this paper aims to investigate the innovative programs, services, and strategies implemented by public libraries with the goal of raising awareness about AI and fostering inclusive civic engagement in AI initiatives in their communities. In order to achieve our goal, we searched libraries’ websites and identified 105 AI-related events held by libraries around the US and Canada. We classified these practices under five categories aimed at raising awareness about AI and building competencies related to AI: lectures and podcasts, hands-on workshops, seminars and conversations, exhibitions, and makerspaces. We also acknowledged that most of these initiatives take place in collaboration. However, we also found that there is no particular focus on inclusive AI and/or marginalized communities and that public libraries could therefore expand their role but providing spaces of community participation particularly targeted at individuals with diverse socio-economic, racial, and cultural backgrounds.},

abstract = {Performance diagnosis systems are defined as detecting abnormal performance phenomena and play a crucial role in cloud applications. An effective performance diagnosis system is often developed based on artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, which can be summarized into a general framework from data to models. However, the AI-based framework has potential hazards that could degrade the user experience and trust. For example, a lack of data privacy may compromise the security of AI models, and low robustness can be hard to apply in complex cloud environments. Therefore, defining the requirements for building a trustworthy AI-based performance diagnosis system has become essential. This article systematically reviews trustworthiness requirements in AI-based performance diagnosis systems. We first introduce trustworthiness requirements and extract six key requirements from a technical perspective, including data privacy, fairness, robustness, explainability, efficiency, and human intervention. We then unify these requirements into a general performance diagnosis framework, ranging from data collection to model development. Next, we comprehensively provide related works for each component and concrete actions to improve trustworthiness in the framework. Finally, we identify possible research directions and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI-based performance diagnosis systems.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very powerful technology and can be a potential disrupter and essential enabler. As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, and so on. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including (1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; (2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and (3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.},

Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners’ retention and cognitive load, but not attention. The type of PA influenced learners' perception of the agent's ability to facilitate learning, its human-like qualities, and its engagement level. However, it did not affect its credibility. This ongoing work will contribute to the growing understanding of the impact of AI in education, provide evidence of the efficacy of AI-generated PAs in instructional videos for learning, and narrow the gap between human-computer interaction research and education.},

abstract = {In the competitive area of sports, injuries not only jeopardize athletes' careers but also lead to substantial setbacks for teams and organizations. Addressing this critical issue, our study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven model that enhances injury management through the strategic implementation of rest periods during athletes' recovery phases. By leveraging data analytics to monitor athletes' health continuously, this model offers sports managers a predictive tool for a proactive and preventative approach to injury management. Our research analyzes athletes' performance and health data across various sports disciplines by employing advanced machine learning techniques to identify patterns related to training regimes, treatment strategies, and the consequent risk and severity of injuries. Our findings underscore the utility of AI in generating actionable insights, thereby enabling more informed decision-making that centers on athletes' well-being. Notably, they demonstrate the model's success in predicting injury risks with high accuracy, subsequently informing tailored intervention strategies that significantly reduce the incidence of injuries. Furthermore, our study highlights how AI technologies can revolutionize training environments by enhancing safety and improving the efficacy of injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies. By advocating for the adoption of AI and technology in sports science, our study not only contributes to enhancing athlete care but also paves the way for future research to optimize athlete performance and health. Overall, this research highlights the role of AI-driven analysis in advancing sports medicine by offering a blueprint for coaches, sports medicine professionals, and athletes alike to navigate the complexities of injury prevention and management.},

abstract = {Affective Intelligent Virtual Agents (AIVAs) has emerged as a research domain that integrates artificial intelligence, affective computing, and virtual agent technology. This fusion aims to develop interactive systems capable of perceiving, interpreting, and responding to human emotions. Affect Control Theory (ACT), a theoretical framework developed by Heise (1977) [18] and adapted for virtual agent applications by Robillard and Hoey (2018) [34] proposes that individuals unconsciously compare their own affective behavior with that of their interlocutor, forming predictions about the latter. Satisfaction and psychological stress levels are then influenced by the extent to which the interlocutor’s behavior aligns with these expectations.In this paper we introduce an AIVA that employs ACT concepts to interpret user text and generate emotionally-aligned responses, facial expressions, and gestures for an animated virtual character, AvataRena, that we are developing to act as a virtual life coach. Using the DeepMoji network, user textual input is mapped to emojis and then to a three-dimensional affect space. We then use prompt engineering to create ChatGPT responses that are moderated by ACT analyses to deliver emotionally-aligned textual and non-verbal responses. This alignment adheres to the principle of deflection within ACT, positing that lower deflection values correspond to heightened positivity in elicited emotions.To validate the model we performed a controlled simulation using 1480 questions derived from counselor-patient interactions [3] to explore differences between prompt-engineered ChatGPT-generated responses with, and without, ACT moderation. Specifically, we found significantly lower deflection measures for the ACT-moderated AIVA responses, indicating that the moderated system adheres more closely to expected affective behavior than unmoderated ChatGPT. This was a large effect (t(1479)=-33.03, p&lt;.001, Cohen’s d = 0.862). Future work will investigate whether this promising result transfers to enhanced user satisfaction and response alignment during extended interactions in the life coach setting.},

abstract = {Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) leverages advanced sensing technologies and artificial intelligence to capture complex learning processes, but integrating diverse data sources into cohesive insights remains challenging. This study introduces a novel methodology for integrating latent class analysis (LCA) within MMLA to map monomodal behavioural indicators into parsimonious multimodal ones. Using a high-fidelity healthcare simulation context, we collected positional, audio, and physiological data, deriving 17 monomodal indicators. LCA identified four distinct latent classes: Collaborative Communication, Embodied Collaboration, Distant Interaction, and Solitary Engagement, each capturing unique monomodal patterns. Epistemic network analysis compared these multimodal indicators with the original monomodal indicators and found that the multimodal approach was more parsimonious while offering higher explanatory power regarding students’ task and collaboration performances. The findings highlight the potential of LCA in simplifying the analysis of complex multimodal data while capturing nuanced, cross-modality behaviours, offering actionable insights for educators and enhancing the design of collaborative learning interventions. This study proposes a pathway for advancing MMLA, making it more parsimonious and manageable, and aligning with the principles of learner-centred education.},

We will discuss challenges in designing with AI for wellbeing originating from a) the domains of design and b) general issues in developing AI systems, and uncover new potential directions that emerge when coupling design, AI and wellbeing. Our aim is to bring together researchers and practitioners from various fields and backgrounds who use data and AI when designing for wellbeing.

abstract = {In the last 10 years, various automated machine learning (AutoML) systems have been proposed to build end-to-end machine learning (ML) pipelines with minimal human interaction. Even though such automatically synthesized ML pipelines are able to achieve competitive performance, recent studies have shown that users do not trust models constructed by AutoML due to missing transparency of AutoML systems and missing explanations for the constructed ML pipelines. In a requirements analysis study with 36 domain experts, data scientists, and AutoML researchers from different professions with vastly different expertise in ML, we collect detailed informational needs for AutoML. We propose XAutoML, an interactive visual analytics tool for explaining arbitrary AutoML optimization procedures and ML pipelines constructed by AutoML. XAutoML combines interactive visualizations with established techniques from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to make the complete AutoML procedure transparent and explainable. By integrating XAutoML with JupyterLab, experienced users can extend the visual analytics with ad-hoc visualizations based on information extracted from XAutoML. We validate our approach in a user study with the same diverse user group from the requirements analysis. All participants were able to extract useful information from XAutoML, leading to a significantly increased understanding of ML pipelines produced by AutoML and the AutoML optimization itself.},

However, few subjects in special schools cover AI-related topics, and it remains unclear how students with special educational needs (SEN) perceive, learn, and use AI. In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence-empowered Real-Time Bidding (AIRTB) is regarded as one of the most enabling technologies for online advertising. It has attracted significant research attention from diverse fields such as pattern recognition, game theory, and mechanism design. Despite its remarkable development and deployment, the AIRTB system can sometimes work against the interests of its participants (e.g., depleting the advertisers’ budget with various kinds of fraud). As such, building trustworthy AIRTB auctioning systems has emerged as an important direction of research in this field in recent years. Owing to the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field and a lack of a comprehensive survey, it is a challenge for researchers to enter this field and contribute towards building trustworthy AIRTB technologies. This article bridges this important gap in trustworthy AIRTB literature. We start by analyzing the key concerns of various AIRTB stakeholders and identify five main dimensions of trust building in AIRTB: robustness, explainability, fairness, auditability and accountability, and environmental well-being. For each of these dimensions, we propose a unique taxonomy of the state-of-the-art, trace the root causes of possible breakdown of trust, and discuss the necessity of the given dimension. This is followed by a comprehensive review of existing strategies for fulfilling the requirements of each trust dimension. In addition, we discuss the promising future directions of research essential towards building trustworthy AIRTB systems to benefit the field of online advertising.},

Various approaches have been used to achieve it, such as confidence scores, explanations, trustworthiness cues, and uncertainty communication. However, a comprehensive understanding of the field is lacking due to the diversity of perspectives arising from various backgrounds that influence it and the lack of a single definition for appropriate trust. To investigate this topic, this article presents a systematic review to identify current practices in building appropriate trust, different ways to measure it, types of tasks used, and potential challenges associated with it. We also propose a Belief, Intentions, and Actions mapping to study commonalities and differences in the concepts related to appropriate trust by (a) describing the existing disagreements on defining appropriate trust, and (b) providing an overview of the concepts and definitions related to appropriate trust in AI from the existing literature. Finally, the challenges identified in studying appropriate trust are discussed, and observations are summarized as current trends, potential gaps, and research opportunities for future work.

abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) is the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence. It aims to enable computers to understand and generate human natural language. With the development of the Internet and big data, natural language processing has become one of the most popular areas in the AI ​​era. Currently, the rise of large-scale pre-trained language models has greatly promoted progress in this field, making the application of natural language processing more extensive and in-depth. This article first reviews the development history of natural language processing, from early rule-based systems to current deep learning-based models. In particular, the proposal of the Transformer architecture marks a major breakthrough in natural language processing technology. It greatly improves the ability to handle long-distance dependencies through the attention mechanism, and has become the basic model for many NLP tasks. Further, this article explores the significant improvements in performance of large-scale pre-trained models such as GPT and BERT, and how they understand and generate language by learning the subtle laws of language on large amounts of text data. Finally, the perspective is returned to large language models, including the development history, performance and challenges of large models, and the introduction of meditation is proposed to solve the problem of model illusion.},

This paper first analyzes the requirements regarding tasks and environments for co-learning. These requirements were subsequently implemented in a testbed: a human and intelligent robot jointly conducting an urban search and rescue task in a simplified task environment. We designed Learning Design Patterns (LDPs): interaction sequences intended to initiate and facilitate co-learning. Effects of LDPs on collaboration, knowledge and understanding, and team performance were experimentally evaluated using the testbed. In comparison to a previous study, participants appreciated the robot more, had more interaction and displayed more commitment. Results show evidence that the LDPs, in comparison with no interventions, initiated and improved learning of the human team member, in particular on knowledge development and understanding the partner. Better knowledge and understanding did, however, not also lead to better team performance. Implications for co-learning in human-AI teams and for learning-supporting interventions are discussed.},

abstract = {Our online interactions are constantly mediated through Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially our social interactions. AI-mediated social interaction is the AI-facilitated process of building and maintaining social connections between individuals through information inferred from people's online posts. With its impending application across a number of contexts, the challenges and opportunities of AI-mediated social interaction remain underexplored. This paper seeks to understand the design space of AI-mediated social interaction in the context of online learning, where students frequently face social isolation. We deployed an AI agent named SAMI in three class discussion forums to help online learners build social connections. Using SAMI as a probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 students to understand their difficulties in remote social interactions and their experiences with SAMI. Through the lenses of social translucence and social-technical gap, we illustrate online learners' difficulties in remote social interactions and how SAMI resolved some of the difficulties. We also identify potential ethical and social challenges of SAMI such as user agency and privacy. Based on our findings, we outline the design space of AI-mediated social interaction. We discuss the design tension between AI performance and ethical design and pinpoint two design opportunities for AI-mediated social interaction in designing towards human-AI collaborative social matching and artificial serendipity.},

abstract = {This paper explores the development and integration of a system combining Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and gamification within a museum setting to enhance the presentation and interaction with cultural heritage. The technological framework employs AR for dynamic artifact interaction and in situ navigation, while VR capabilities facilitate virtual tours, broadening access for individuals with disabilities or those from distant geographies or socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Gamification transforms educational content into interactive experiences, fostering deeper engagement and learning. Moreover, aligning with the mission of museum institutions for cultural heritage preservation, a module for digital conservation and reconstruction was developed resorting to photogrammetry-based approaches. This module aims to create a virtual catalog accessible to both experts and the general public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools automate tasks such as generating thematic quizzes for gamification and cataloging scanned artifacts. The system aims to improve the interpretative and educational potential of museum exhibits, modernizing visitor engagement while preserving the integrity of physical artifacts and spaces. Its continuous evolution aims to bridge traditional forms of cultural preservation and promotion with contemporary digital interaction techniques, leveraged from cost-effective publicly accessible edge technologies.},

abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of web-based generative artificial intelligence technologies necessitates that all students experience teaming with such technologies -- exploring their strengths and limitations and learning how to create synergy with them. To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

abstract = {Bias evaluation benchmarks and dataset and model documentation have emerged as central processes for assessing the biases and harms of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, these auditing processes have been criticized for their failure to integrate the knowledge of marginalized communities and consider the power dynamics between auditors and the communities. Consequently, modes of bias evaluation have been proposed that engage impacted communities in identifying and assessing the harms of AI systems (e.g., bias bounties). Even so, asking what marginalized communities want from such auditing processes has been neglected. In this paper, we ask queer communities for their positions on, and desires from, auditing processes. To this end, we organized a participatory workshop to critique and redesign bias bounties from queer perspectives. We found that when given space, the scope of feedback from workshop participants goes far beyond what bias bounties afford, with participants questioning the ownership, incentives, and efficacy of bounties. We conclude by advocating for community ownership of bounties and complementing bounties with participatory processes (e.g., co-creation).},

However, using non-abstract personal data such as head portraits for product personalization has been understudied. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have enabled generating stylized head portraits, these images also raise concerns about lack of control, artificiality, and ethics, which potentially limit their broader use. In this work, we present PicMe, a design support tool that converts user face photos into stylized head portraits as vector graphics that can be used to personalize products. To enable style transfer, PicMe leverages a deep-learning-based algorithm trained on an extended open-source illustration dataset of characters in a cartoonish and minimalistic style. We evaluated PicMe through two experiments and a user study. The results of our evaluation showed that PicMe can help create personalized head portraits that support self-expression.},

Despite their potential, existing LLMs face challenges in dealing with complex polypharmacy scenarios and often grapple with data lag issues. To address these limitations, we introduce an LLM-based Chinese medication guidance system, called ShennongMGS, specifically tailored for robust medication guidance and adverse drug reaction predictions. Our system transforms multi-source heterogeneous medication information into a knowledge graph and employs a two-stage training strategy to construct a specialized LLM (ShennongGPT). This method enables the simulation of professional pharmacists’ decision-making processes and incorporates the capability for knowledge self-updating, thereby significantly enhancing drug safety and the overall quality of medical services. Rigorously evaluated by medical professionals and artificial intelligence experts, our method demonstrates superiority, outperforming existing general and specialized LLMs in performance.},

In recent years, the research about emotional interaction in online education, and the application of Affective Computing in online education came into being. This paper introduces the impact of Affective Computing on online education, including the use of expressions, speech, eye movement, and physiological signals, as well as text and questionnaires and other modals, or multi-modal to infer students' emotional state and learning state in the learning process, and then to realize personalized learning support. The emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface, can be applied to online education combined with Affective Computing technologies to improve the interaction between learners and the on-line learning system. This paper proposes a framework of online learning and experiment system based on Affective Computing supported by Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface. The system can provide personalized education for students and help them to carry out experiments in a virtual reality environment. The framework can reduce the impact on students in the process of data collection, so that it can obtain more real data, and the framework uses emerging technologies to provide support and reference for emotion analysis and recognition, which will make the analysis and response more timely and emotion recognition more accurate.},

Studies in software development have explored the adoption of these tools, investigating their characteristics and impacts and how practitioners interact and perceive them. To contribute to this growing body of knowledge, in this study, we aim to explore the adoption of AI-based programming assistants in the Brazilian industry. More specifically, we aim to understand how practitioners of a particular Brazilian agroindustry-related company perceive and use AI-based tools to develop software. Using an online survey, we collected and analyzed 72 responses from employees of the studied company. Our findings suggest that practitioners mainly adopt ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, interacting with these tools to accelerate online searching, typing, and syntax recall. A recurrent difficulty is the lack of context in the suggestions provided by these tools, but participants work on detailed descriptions to contextualize and cope with this challenge. Among the reasons for not using AI-based tools, the most influential is that participants use a commercial programming language, i.e., Uniface, which these tools lack examples. Our results provide insights into the state of the practice related to AI-based programming assistants and discuss implications for practitioners and researchers.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are evaluated using competitive methods that rely on benchmark datasets to determine performance. These benchmark datasets, however, are often constructed through arbitrary processes that fall short in encapsulating the depth and breadth of the tasks they are intended to measure. In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community. This genealogy highlights how contemporary dynamics and limitations of benchmarking developed from a longer history of collaboration, standardization, and competition. We end with reflections on how this history informs our understanding of benchmarking in the current era of generative artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Opinion polarization, a phenomenon characterized by the widening divide between individuals or groups holding contrasting viewpoints, has emerged as a salient feature of contemporary societal discourse, particularly in social media. Opinion polarization poses challenges to decision-making processes, hindering consensus-building efforts vital for addressing pressing different issues such as climate change and socioeconomic inequality. Thus, it is essential to develop new methods and tools for analyzing and addressing the dynamics of opinion polarization. In the last years, visualization techniques have evolved to provide valuable insight when modeling knowledge, and their integration with artificial intelligence techniques has strengthened different possibilities, paving the way for visual analytics and visual knowledge discovery. Computational argumentation is a growing area in AI that has evolved to provide a sound formal model on how arguments are structured, evaluated, and utilized in various contexts, relying on natural language and machine learning techniques. This paper presents

Polviz

, a novel framework for assessing opinion polarization combining visual analytics and computational argumentation. We provide a characterization of conceptual elements associated with argument-based models (argument, conflict, etc.) oriented towards modeling opinion polarization in social media. We also provide a toolkit of visual analytics tools that allow us to navigate among different models for opinion polarization. Ultimate results corresponding to knowledge emerging from the resulting models are obtained by including a “human in the loop” at the end of the analysis.},

abstract = {Machine learning models are increasingly present in our society; many of these models integrate Web Systems and are directly related to the content we consume daily. Nonetheless, on several occasions, these models have been responsible for decisions that spread prejudices or even decisions, if committed by humans, that would be punishable. After several cases of this nature came to light, research and discussion topics such as Fairness in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Ethics gained a boost of importance and urgency in our society. Thus, one way to make Web Systems fairer in the future is to show how they can currently be unfair. In order to support discussions and be a reference for unfairness cases in machine learning decisions, this work aims to organize in a single document known decision-making that was wholly or partially supported by machine learning models that propagated prejudices, stereotypes, and inequalities in Web Systems. We conceptualize relevant categories of unfairness (such as Web Search and Deep Fake), and when possible, we present the solution adopted by those involved. Furthermore, we discuss approaches to mitigate or prevent discriminatory effects in Web Systems decision-making based on machine learning.},

abstract = {In recent years, as a result of the emergence of innovative technologies and applications, several solutions aiming to improve the quality of education have been appearing. However, mainly due to the human factor of lack of understanding and trust in these applications, adoption by higher education institutions remained low. In my doctoral thesis, I aim to contribute to overcoming this barrier in two main steps. First, I try to understand more deeply the nature of the existing contrast between perceived benefits and concerns of higher education students regarding one specific application area, artificial intelligence-based personalized learning. Building on these results, I will then design and evaluate a new personalized learning tool, developed specifically with user-centered data privacy and ethical considerations in mind that specifically respond to the identified concerns. The uniqueness of this tool is the transparency and controllability of different levels of personalization, which ensures that each student can freely choose the extent to which they are willing to make their data available in order to receive a personalized learning experience. The effects of this design principle on privacy concerns and learning outcomes will then be tested in multiple lab- and field studies. I believe this project fits well into both the “Personalizing Learning Experiences through User Modeling” and the “Fairness, Transparency, Accountability, and Privacy” tracks of the UMAP conference, which is why I have decided to apply for the Doctoral Consortium.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has come along with multiple benefits in education (e.g., 24h teacher, augmenting student monitoring). However, at the same time, these tools hinder teachers’ autonomy, limiting the capacity and freedom to exert control over students’ actions and their learning process. Additionally, the generic character of the GenAI output usually lacks contextualization (e.g., course curriculum, students’ age), thus hampering the successful attainment of the course goals. To address these issues, this paper proposes the development of a system mediating between the GenAI interfaces and their back-ends. This system allows teachers to monitor the students’ interactions and align the given answers with the course learning objectives and teaching methods. This research follows the Systems Development Research methodology, and within the first iteration, we developed a system prototype that was evaluated with 8 secondary-school teachers. Results showed a high perceived usefulness of the system for monitoring students’ interactions; for alerting the teachers to take specific actions (e.g., suspicious copy-paste behaviours), and for having control over the GenAI outputs. Additionally, while most teachers perceived a higher autonomy level within the given scenarios, some teachers did not. The evaluation also served to collect further requirements and usability features to keep improving the tool in the next methodological iterations.},

We map each framework w.r.t. the different Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases discovering that most of these frameworks fall just in the Requirements Elicitation phase, leaving the other phases uncovered. Very few of these frameworks offer supporting tools for practitioners, and they are mainly provided by private companies. Our results reveal that there is not a "catching-all" framework supporting both technical and non-technical stakeholders in the implementation of real-world projects. Our findings highlight the lack of a comprehensive framework encompassing all RAI principles and all (SDLC) phases that could be navigated by users with different skill sets and with different goals.},

As challenges, researchers and practitioners should investigate how to determine appropriate levels of transparency through personalization, produce human-centered knowledge on transparency, and study new methods, tools, and processes to support CA development that considers inclusiveness.},

The concept of uncertainty is a recurring theme across multiple disciplines, with varying focuses and approaches. Here, we focus on the diverse nature of uncertainty in medical applications, emphasizing the importance of quantifying uncertainty in model predictions and its advantages in specific clinical settings. Questions that emerge in this context range from the guidelines for AI integration in the healthcare domain to the ethical deliberations and their compatibility with cutting-edge AI research. Together with a description of the main specific works in this context, we also discuss that, as medicine evolves and introduces novel sources of uncertainty, there is a need for more versatile uncertainty quantification methods to be developed collaboratively by researchers and healthcare professionals. Finally, we acknowledge the limitations of current uncertainty quantification methods in addressing the different facets of uncertainty within the medical domain. In particular, we identify from this survey a relative paucity of approaches that focus on the user’s perception of uncertainty and accordingly of trustworthiness.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) - enabled systems capture new frontiers of industrial use. The development of such systems is becoming a priority course for many vendors due to the unique capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The current trend today is to integrate ML functionality into complex systems as architectural components. There are a lot of relevant challenges associated with this strategy in terms of the overall system architecture and in the context of development workflow (MLOps). The probabilistic nature, crucial dependency on data, and work in an environment of high uncertainty do not allow software engineers to apply traditional software development methodologies. As a result, there is a community request to systematize the most relevant experience in building software architectures with ML components, to create new approaches to organizing the process of developing ML-enabled systems, and to build new models for assessing the system quality. Our research contributes to all mentioned directions and aims to create a methodology for the efficient implementation of ML-enabled software and AI components. The results of the research can be used in the design and development in industrial settings, as well as a basis for further studies in the research field, which is of both practical and scientific value.},

abstract = {As artificial agents become increasingly embedded in our society, we must ensure that their behavior aligns with human values. Value alignment entails value inference, the process of identifying values and reasoning about how humans prioritize values. We introduce a holistic framework that connects the technical (AI) components necessary for value inference. Subsequently, we discuss how hybrid intelligence-the synergy of human and artificial intelligence---is instrumental to the success of value inference. Finally, we illustrate how value inference both poses significant challenges and provides novel opportunities for multiagent systems research.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) obfuscate the boundaries between digital, physical, and social spaces, a trend expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Traditionally, software engineering has prioritized technical aspects, focusing on functional correctness and reliability while often neglecting broader societal implications. With the rise of software agents enabled by Large Language Models (LLMs) and capable of emulating human intelligence and perception, there is a growing recognition of the need for addressing socio-critical issues. Unlike technical challenges, these issues cannot be resolved through traditional, deterministic approaches due to their subjective nature and dependence on evolving factors such as culture and demographics. This paper dives into this problem and advocates the need for revising existing engineering principles and methodologies. We propose a conceptual framework for quality assurance where AI is not only the driver of socio-critical systems but also a fundamental tool in their engineering process. Such framework encapsulates pre-production and runtime workflows where LLM-based agents, so-called artificial doppelg\"{a}ngers, continuously assess and refine socio-critical systems ensuring their alignment with established societal standards.},

abstract = {As emerging technologies are rapidly advancing as part of our societies and everyday life, it is crucial to include and empower all students in learning about computing and advanced technologies. These include technical capabilities of algorithms, such as the use of artificial intelligence, that enable novel interactions between humans and their environment and give rise to societal and ethical concerns. In this article, we investigate how to engage students through diverse learning paths in computing education. We emphasise students who are generally less motivated to learn about technology and their ethical and societal implications, focusing on primary students (13-14 years) in a culturally diverse Danish public school. Based on design ethnographic studies and nexus analysis the study explored learning activities and social interactions in relation to students’ individual learning paths. The work extends Smith’s and Iversen’s (2018) framework on student archetypes in learning about digital technology to include aspects of diversity and inclusive education. The findings highlight, first, the impact of students’ cultural backgrounds in their learning paths even within the same archetype; second, opportunities for embodied learning strategies to engage “not (yet) motivated” students; third, benefits for the interplay between different student archetypes in classroom dynamics and fourth, how students may shift between archetypes depending on the learning context and theme.},

abstract = {Even though the engagement in self-regulated learning (SRL) has been shown to boost academic performance, SRL skills of many learners remain underdeveloped. They often struggle to productively navigate multiple cognitive, affective, metacognitive and motivational (CAMM) processes in SRL. To provide learners with the required SRL support, it is essential to understand how learners enact CAMM processes as they study. More research is needed to advance the measurement of affective and motivational processes within SRL, and investigate how these processes influence learners’ cognition and metacognition. With this in mind, we conducted a lab study involving 22 university students who worked on a 45-minute reading and writing task in digital learning environment. We used a wearable electroencephalogram device to record learner academic emotional and motivational states, and digital trace data to record learner cognitive and metacognitive processes. We harnessed time series prediction and explainable artificial intelligence methods to examine how learner’s emotional and motivational states influence their choice of cognitive and metacognitive processes. Our results indicate that emotional and motivational states can predict learners’ use of low cognitive, high cognitive and metacognitive processes with considerable classification accuracy (F1 &gt; 0.73), and that higher values of interest, engagement and excitement promote cognitive processing.},

abstract = {The surge in interest and demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills has significantly increased student enrollment in AI and Machine Learning (ML) classes. In a large ML course at Georgia Institute of Technology, multi-week assignments encourage students to critically think about various ML algorithms theoretically and in an applied setting. Given the complexity of these large assignments, there exists the potential for bugs to remain undetected even after the verification process. These bugs lead to a significant increase in student questions and concerns, necessitate re-releasing assignment, and degrade the homework experience. To reduce and even prevent bugs in assignments, we adopt the DevOps methodology and implement a novel CI/CD pipeline along with Gitflow to automate the validation process of an assignment, from creation to release. An analysis of our classroom forum across semesters demonstrates that integrating a CI/CD pipeline with Gitflow effectively reduces the number of bug-related posts, allowing the instructional team to refocus on enhancing the student learning experience.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems have been developed for years to guide the interaction of the users with systems in very diverse domains where information overload exists aimed to help humans in decision making. In order to better support the humans, the more the system knows about the user, the more useful recommendations the user can receive. In this sense, there is a need to explore which are the intrinsic human aspects that should be taken into account in each case when building the user models that provide the personalization. Moreover, there is a need to define and apply methodologies, guidelines and frameworks to develop this kind of systems in order to tackle the challenges of current artificial intelligence applications including issues such as ethics, transparency, explainability and sustainability. For our research, we have chosen the psychomotor domain. To provide some insights into this problem, in this paper we present the research directions we are exploring to apply a human-centric approach when developing the iBAID (intelligent Basket AID) psychomotor system, which aims to recommend the physical activities and movements to perform when training in basketball, either to improve the technique, to recover from an injury or even to keep active when getting older.},

It will also allow them to determine the level of student performance, identify gaps in learning materials, and research student data.The authors have identified further directions for the development of a LAD for a professor, including modeling algorithms for researching student behavior and learning style using Artificial Intelligence and presenting LA in a visualized form. This paper shows the stages of creating a professor's LAD prototype as a functional part of the adaptive learning system in the HASKI-System to analyze visual information obtained from LA and the possibilities to monitor the learning process, learning progress, student activity, and make decisions on careful intervention in the students’ learning process.},

Employing hierarchical multiple regression analysis on data collected from 131 college students in Shanghai, China, the study reveals that higher self-efficacy in using AI Chatbots is significantly associated with lower class-related anxiety, even after controlling for students' College English Test Band 4 (CET4) status. The results suggest the potential of AI Chatbots in reducing class-related anxiety in academic settings, possibly by enhancing students' perceived control over their learning environments, as demonstrated in the context of Chinese EFL students.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied to disciplines beyond computer science (CS). Engineers, statisticians, business analysts, biologists, physicists, physicians, and pharmacists, are among the many non-CS professionals who leverage the power of AI algorithms and systems for solving their domain-specific problems. Although AI has been found useful for solving a wide range of previously unsolvable problems, there are important limitations associated with contemporary AI. It is therefore important to inform current and future AI users regarding both strengths and weaknesses of AI in its current form, as well as what AI will be like in the foreseeable future. In this paper, the authors describe a pedagogical approach toward educating AI users from a range of STEM disciplines so that they can best exploit what AI has to offer. Specifically, a balanced approach is taken to ensure that learners gain knowledge and skills in what AI can or cannot do for them. A growing suite of experiential learning modules, which complement existing educational resources, serve as a vehicle for getting STEM learners ready for a future workplace characterized by significant use of AI technologies. These learning modules promote active learning and can be applied in a traditional classroom setting, self-directed online study, or a mix of the two modes. The paper ends with a presentation of encouraging results of actual use of the experiential learning modules in a mixed mode setting across multiple quantitative disciplines. All project artifacts, including the developed experiential learning modules, recommended uses, and best practices, are freely available on the project website.

abstract = {Data annotation interfaces predominantly leverage ground truth labels to guide annotators toward accurate responses. With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in domain-specific professional tasks, it has become increasingly important to help beginning annotators identify how their early-stage knowledge can lead to inaccurate answers, which in turn, helps to ensure quality annotations at scale. To investigate this issue, we conducted a formative study involving eight individuals from the field of disaster management, each possessing varying levels of expertise. The goal was to understand the prevalent factors contributing to disagreements among annotators when classifying Twitter messages related to disasters and to analyze their respective responses. Our analysis identified two primary causes of disagreement between expert and beginner annotators: 1) a lack of contextual knowledge or uncertainty about the situation, and 2) the absence of visual or supplementary cues. Based on these findings, we designed a Context interface, which generates aids that help beginners identify potential mistakes and provide the hidden context of the presented tweet. The summative study compares Context design with two widely used designs in data annotation UI, Highlight and Reasoning-based interfaces. We found significant differences between these designs in terms of attitudinal and behavioral data. We conclude with implications for designing future interfaces aiming at closing the knowledge gap among annotators.},

abstract = {Within heterogeneous multi-core systems, the parallelization of tasks and efficient utilization of processors are of paramount significance. The interdependent tasks are often represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and an effective task scheduling algorithm can significantly optimize the performance of these systems. However, the complex interactions between processors with different processing capabilities and interdependencies between tasks make task scheduling an NP-complete challenge. As artificial intelligence developed, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides an effective solution to this challenge. In this paper, we propose an intelligent DRL-based task scheduling model for heterogeneous multi-core systems, named GG-DRL, aiming at minimizing the processing time makespan and maintaining load balancing between processors. Firstly, we adopt Markov Decision Process to model the scheduling problem. Secondly, we design a graph preprocessing module combining Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to deal with the complex DAG task graph structure to enhance the representation of task features. Finally, we use an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning strategy to train this model effectively. Experiments demonstrate that the model can achieve a shorter makespan as well as a better load balancing effect.},

abstract = {Recent internationally relevant diplomatic and economic developments have placed a bright spotlight on the relevance of genuine and false claims. In a post-truth era, or as more commonly known, the era of fake news, an increasing interest has manifested in relation to how this phenomenon can and has been applied to thwart people's reasoning and behaviour. The advancements in modern technology have pushed scientists to question the scale and impact of fake news on humanity. Since technology has become closely integrated with the lives of humankind over the years, its pervasiveness is required to be taken into account to analyse how fake news is being generated and widely shared.For a first-hand impression of the issue, a survey was designed and distributed to the general public to take part in. Additionally, a set of interviews were conducted with specialists from a number of fields in which participants expressed their views on the issue and their suggestions on curbing it. Despite differences in their views, a general consensus was reached that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to reduce the threat, and better educate and inform the public. In doing so, multiple entities and skilled individuals must be roped in to play their part in safeguarding information veracity and supporting end users.The study also provides research insight into this impending threat that should give a clearer understanding of the fate of tomorrow's cyberspace as well as the societies we form a part of. The proposed recommendations, which combine both regulatory and technology fields, aim to bolster the capacity of nations and better equip governments in tackling the evolving state of fake news. It is envisioned that through these recommendations, societies move towards an age where both people and technology become part of the solution rather than the cause of such threats.},

abstract = {Based on the concepts of artificial intelligence and the metaverse, this study discussed the practices of regional teaching hospitals and developed an interactive learning-based quiz system using the GOXR programming language. The system is designed to provide a convenient online self-learning environment for surgical medical workers to test themselves and learn at different times. Synchronized multi-user online operation is a core function of the quiz system, which allows users to identify and diagnose surgical instruments. The system can also test the learners' familiarity with various types of surgical instruments through a quiz game. During the test, users can know their personal ranking after the quiz, and determine the areas in which they need to strengthen learning. The quiz system provides a flexible learning pathway for medical workers on 24-hour shifts in the operating room, and promotes the concepts of independent learning and continuous education through interactive media and game-based learning mechanisms that make the learning process more interesting. The application of the quiz system facilitates medical workers’ mastery of selected surgical instruments, and provides a cogent example of innovation in education and training. In order to verify the effectiveness of the system, 58 medical workers participated in the quiz, and their questionnaire feedback reflected their satisfaction and the impact of the learning environment. The results also indicate that the quiz system has the potential to be applied to many other aspects in industrial circles, and can provide a wide range of management and practice benefits. As technologies advance and innovations have been made to teaching model, the quiz system exhibits significant potential and value in improving medical workers' professional competence and meeting teaching needs in the contemporary era.},

abstract = {In the past few years, the EU has shown a growing commitment to address the rapid transformations brought about by the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) developments by increasing efforts in AI regulation. Nevertheless, despite the growing body of technical knowledge and progress, the governance of AI-intensive technologies remains dynamic and challenging. A mounting chorus of experts have been sharing their reservations regarding an overemphasis on regulation in Europe. Among their core arguments is the concern that such an approach might hinder innovation within the AI arena. This concern resonates particularly strongly compared to the United States and Asia, where AI-driven innovation appears to be surging ahead, potentially leaving Europe behind. The current contribution is a position paper emphasising the need for balanced AI governance to foster ethical innovation, reliability, and competitiveness of European technology. This paper only explores recent AI regulations and upcoming European laws relevant to the topic to ensure conciseness while underscoring Europe’s role in the global AI landscape. The authors analyse European governance approaches and their impact, especially on SMEs and startups, offering a comparative view of global regulatory efforts. We address the complexities of creating a comprehensive, human-centred AI master’s programme for higher education and the importance of ethical AI education. Finally, we discuss how Europe can seize opportunities to promote ethical and reliable AI progress through education, fostering a balanced approach to regulation and enhancing young professionals’ understanding of ethical and legal aspects.},

abstract = {As software products become larger and more complex, the test infrastructure needed for quality assurance grows similarly, causing a constant increase in operational and maintenance costs. Although rising in popularity, most Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Software Defect Prediction (SDP) solutions address singular test phases. In contrast, the need to address the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is rarely explored. Therefore in this paper, we define the problem of extending the SDP concept to the entire SDLC, as this may be one of the significant next steps for the field. Furthermore, we explore the similarity between the defined challenge and the widely known Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP). We use Nokia's 5G wireless technology test process to illustrate the proposed concept. Resulting comparison validates the applicability of MKP to optimize the overall test cycle, which can be similarly relevant to any large-scale industrial software development process.},

abstract = {Modern society is increasingly moving toward complex and distributed computing systems. The increase in scale and complexity of these systems challenges O&amp;M teams that perform daily monitoring and repair operations, in contrast with the increasing demand for reliability and scalability of modern applications. For this reason, the study of automated and intelligent monitoring systems has recently sparked much interest across applied IT industry and academia. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has been proposed to tackle modern IT administration challenges thanks to Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data. However, AIOps as a research topic is still largely unstructured and unexplored, due to missing conventions in categorizing contributions for their data requirements, target goals, and components. In this work, we focus on AIOps for Failure Management (FM), characterizing and describing 5 different categories and 14 subcategories of contributions, based on their time intervention window and the target problem being solved. We review 100 FM solutions, focusing on applicability requirements and the quantitative results achieved, to facilitate an effective application of AIOps solutions. Finally, we discuss current development problems in the areas covered by AIOps and delineate possible future trends for AI-based failure management.},

abstract = {As Cyber Physical-Internet of Things Systems (CPS-IoT Systems) continue to advance, we have noticed an expansion of the variety of entity types deployed in these systems. With this expansion, the complexity of handling vastly different communication protocols, processes, and data within the system in a timely manner has become a significant challenge. One potential method of quickly processing this data is to push essential computation concerning the Transitional State Change (TSC) feedback loop from the cloud to the edge of the system. In this paper, we propose DRAEC, a novel edge computing framework that uses agent-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Complex-Event Processing (CEP) to significantly decrease the latency of the TSC feedback loop and subsequently increase the system’s scalability. This increase in performance is achieved by using a CEP system to synthesize discreet events from CPS-IoT entity telemetry, which our novel Dynamic Reactive Agent then uses to quickly generate and enforce controls on a user’s physical environment via a user-defined operational policy. We then present supporting results, showing that our novel edge computing framework enables a CPS-IoT control system to outperform a cloud-centric variant by 20-43x (depending on the connection type) when comparing the latency of the TSC feedback loop; it also enables support of significantly larger scale (10-100x) systems while maintaining the same level of service as the cloud-centric version.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) empower low-footprint embedded devices for real-time on-device Machine Learning (ML). While many acknowledge the potential benefits of TinyML, its practical implementation presents unique challenges. This study aims to bridge the gap between prototyping single TinyML models and developing reliable TinyML systems in production: (1)&nbsp;Embedded devices operate in dynamically changing conditions. Existing TinyML solutions primarily focus on inference, with models trained offline on powerful machines and deployed as static objects. However, static models may underperform in the real world due to evolving input data distributions. We propose online learning to enable training on constrained devices, adapting local models toward the latest field conditions. (2)&nbsp;Nevertheless, current on-device learning methods struggle with heterogeneous deployment conditions and the scarcity of labeled data when applied across numerous devices. We introduce federated meta-learning incorporating online learning to enhance model generalization, facilitating rapid learning. This approach ensures optimal performance among distributed devices by knowledge sharing. (3)&nbsp;Moreover, TinyML’s pivotal advantage is widespread adoption. Embedded devices and TinyML models prioritize extreme efficiency, leading to diverse characteristics ranging from memory and sensors to model architectures. Given their diversity and non-standardized representations, managing these resources becomes challenging as TinyML systems scale up. We present semantic management for the joint management of models and devices at scale. We demonstrate our methods through a basic regression example and then assess them in three real-world TinyML applications: handwritten character image classification, keyword audio classification, and smart building presence detection. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approaches from various perspectives, such as accuracy improvement, resource savings, and engineering effort reduction.},

abstract = {With the integration of artificial intelligence and education, online education has received unprecedented attention. The new infrastructure system is improved, and artificial intelligence is widely used in teaching, management, resource construction and other fields. At present, the research on intelligent education is still focused on improving students' learning efficiency, intelligent education monitoring and other aspects, but there is no relevant research on the evaluation system of AI-assisted teachers' teaching level and effect. In fact, students' learning effect is not only related to their own efforts, advanced educational equipment or not, but also closely related to the education level and style of teachers. We propose a Federated-learning based online teaching emotion recognition detection for teachers. Through the recognition of teachers' teaching emotion, it can realize the auxiliary analysis of the teaching level of teachers, help to find the problems in the process of online teaching and improve the teaching level of teachers. At the same time, on the basis of protecting the privacy security and legal compliance of teachers' teaching data, the Federated learning realization realizes data sharing, joint modeling, and improves the recognition effect. The experimental results show that the modified model can realize the collaborative training of participants under the independent and unbalanced data, and realize the effective recognition of facial emotion in online education teaching of teachers.},

abstract = {The classroom is the most basic and important learning venue for college students. With the development of information technology, various online teaching platforms and mobile apps have been widely used in universities, which has brought great convenience to the teaching and student interaction management of college teachers. However, this management lacks objective data on the performance of students in classroom learning, especially the uneven behavior of vocational college students in the classroom. So this article designs a student classroom learning behavior recognition system based on artificial intelligence technology, which can comprehensively collect and recognize different behaviors of students in the classroom. This helps students better understand their classroom learning status, helps teachers to objectively grasp students' classroom learning situation, and is more conducive to teachers teaching according to their aptitude.},

This framework analyses human behaviour during the simulated emergency rescue process and collects relevant data. The module function is determined by the parallel emergency management method. The system comprises three data processing modules: the behavioural input module, the emergency event feedback module, and the data classification and processing module. The logic of AI data processing is employed to establish a data cycle evolution system, which assists rescue personnel in enhancing their professional abilities, increasing the success rate of rescue operations, and optimising the role of AI technology and computer simulation methodology in the design of the practice.},

abstract = {In the coming years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be applied as a teammate that works alongside and collaborates with humans. Prior research in teaming and CSCW has shown that teammates have the ability to change the thoughts and behaviors of each other through simple interactions in a process known as social influence. However, to date, research has yet to identify the social influence that AI teammates could have in these human-AI teams, which has led to a limited understanding of how AI teammates will change the behaviors of their human teammates. To remedy this gap, we conduct a mixed-methods study (N=33) with young individuals to explore how humans could behaviorally adapt and perceive their behavioral adaptation due to interaction with an AI teammate. Qualitative results report that perceived three unique stages they had to experience for the social influence of their AI teammate to lead to adaptation (i.e., perceiving a sense of control, identifying a technological or performative justification, and gaining first-hand experience). Quantitative results validate and illustrate the results of this perceived process, as results show that participants adapted their behaviors to complement the behaviors of different types of AI teammates. This study contributes to the CSCW/HCI field by developing an initial understanding of AI teammates' social influence in human-AI teams, which will be a pivotal design and research consideration in future efforts.},

The hotspot of education intelligence research. The rapid development of artificial intelligence has made sufficient preparations for its involvement in school education and realization of smart classrooms. Based on the intelligent architecture of artificial intelligence, it will redefine classroom teaching with its closed-loop architecture formed by intelligent interaction and intelligent deep learning. To further strengthen the ideological education of college students is necessary to conform to the development situation of the big data era. Therefore, it is necessary to actively explore ideological education strategies for college students based on the era of big data by building network positions, applying social media, developing application software, relying on communication tools, and building smart classrooms. This article is based on the smart classroom information technology platform to design teaching goals and plans, implement interactive teaching, and innovate the teaching design and implementation strategies of smart classrooms.},

Finally, we propose technology and policy strategies to evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in light of the protections they actually confer.

abstract = {The rapid progression of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has raised significant interest and concern in academia. Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.},

This paper presents a four-day, PhD-level course on Responsible Artificial Intelligence conducted at the University of Udine by Dr. Damiano Spina. Using a hands-on approach, the course aimed to illustrate the application of responsible AI concepts in research. Using case studies based on existing IR research, the course explored responsible AI concepts such as positionality, participatory research, fairness, diversity, and ethics. The course engaged 23 participants, both online and in person, including PhD students at various stages, postdoctoral researchers, professors, and academic staff. It featured four sessions and five interactive group activities. Of the 23 attendees, 20 (87%) actively participated in the activities, and 14 (61%) completed the final survey.

We crafted systematic summaries of 64 examples of such media and used them as the basis for an interdisciplinary workshop involving nine subject matter experts from varying fields of education and technology. The workshop yielded insights regarding the qualities of these depictions; in particular our findings allowed us to draw important implications about how narrative depictions of intelligent technologies could be applied in K-12 education in ML and AI.},

Utilizing a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) layer, this framework integrates real-time and historical production data from a physical manufacturing system to a digital twin, enabling dynamic simulation and analysis. Maintenance decisions are informed by DRL algorithms that analyze this data, facilitating smart maintenance strategies that adaptively prioritize tasks based on predictive analytics. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in a lab-scale drone factory, where maintenance tasks are prioritized using a proximal policy optimization. This integration not only refines maintenance decisions but also aligns with the broader goals of operational efficiency and sustainability in Industry 4.0. Our results highlight the potential of combining DRL with digital twins to significantly enhance decision-making in industrial maintenance, offering a novel approach to predictive and prescriptive maintenance practices.},

abstract = {Using learning analytics to investigate and support collaborative learning has been explored for many years. Recently, automated approaches with various artificial intelligence approaches have provided promising results for modelling and predicting student engagement and performance in collaborative learning tasks. However, due to the lack of transparency and interpretability caused by the use of “black box” approaches in learning analytics design and implementation, guidance for teaching and learning practice may become a challenge. On the one hand, the black box created by machine learning algorithms and models prevents users from obtaining educationally meaningful learning and teaching suggestions. On the other hand, focusing on group and cohort level analysis only can make it difficult to provide specific support for individual students working in collaborative groups. This paper proposes a transparent approach to automatically detect student's individual engagement in the process of collaboration. The results show that the proposed approach can reflect student's individual engagement and can be used as an indicator to distinguish students with different collaborative learning challenges (cognitive, behavioural and emotional) and learning outcomes. The potential of the proposed collaboration analytics approach for scaffolding collaborative learning practice in face-to-face contexts is discussed and future research suggestions are provided.},

Theoretically, we contribute a research-based, comprehensive, and current framework for children’s AI literacy, advancing its conceptualization in early life stages.

abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has ignited discussions surrounding its potential to enhance creative pursuits. However, distinctions between children’s and adult’s creative needs exist, which is important when considering the possibility of GenAI for children’s creative usage. Building upon work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fostering children’s computational thinking skills, this study explores interactions between children (aged 7-13) and GenAI tools through methods of participatory design. We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

abstract = {Collaboration can amalgamate diverse ideas, styles, and visual elements, fostering creativity and innovation among different designers. In collaborative design, sketches play a pivotal role as a means of expressing design creativity. However, designers often tend to not openly share these meticulously crafted sketches. This phenomenon of data island in the design area hinders its digital transformation under the third wave of AI. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Generative Artificial Intelligence Clothing system, namely StyleWe, employing federated learning to aid in sketch design. StyleWe is committed to establishing an ecosystem wherein designers can exchange sketch styles among themselves. Through StyleWe, designers can generate sketches that incorporate various designers' styles from their peers, drawing inspiration from collaboration without the need for data disclosure or upload. Extensive performance evaluations and user studies indicate that our StyleWe system can produce multi-styled sketches of comparable quality to human-designed ones while significantly enhancing efficiency compared to hand-drawn sketches.},

abstract = {The legal landscape encompasses a wide array of lawsuit types, presenting lawyers with challenges in delivering timely and accurate information to clients, particularly concerning critical aspects like potential imprisonment duration or financial repercussions. Compounded by the scarcity of legal experts, there's an urgent need to enhance the efficiency of traditional legal workflows. Recent advances in deep learning, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising solutions to this challenge. Leveraging LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities, we propose a novel approach integrating LLM-based methodologies with specially designed prompts to address precision requirements in legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) applications. The proposed work seeks to bridge the gap between traditional legal practices and modern technological advancements, paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and equitable legal system. To validate this method, we introduce a curated dataset tailored to precision-oriented LegalAI tasks, serving as a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based approaches. Extensive experimentation confirms the efficacy of our methodology in generating accurate numerical estimates within the legal domain, emphasizing the role of LLMs in streamlining legal processes and meeting the evolving demands of LegalAI.

abstract = {With the deepening reform and construction of the police system, it is imperative to fully utilize technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things to rapidly enhance the intelligence level of the new generation command center. Natural language processing and deep learning technologies can achieve recognition, understanding, and correlation analysis of public security textual information, which are core steps in building intelligence. Due to the diversity of information in the public security field, the accuracy of these technologies still requires further research. In the analysis of public security incidents, the application of NLP technology faces challenges in optimizing technical models and algorithms, which greatly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of public safety management by analyzing, understanding, predicting, and responding to various security challenges in an intelligent manner. With the advent of the big data era, the public security sector has accumulated massive amounts of police incident data, which contain rich information but also bring difficulties in processing and analysis. Traditional NLP models often struggle to cope with the complex and ever-changing police incident texts, leading to compromised accuracy and reliability of the analysis results. This paper will explore the key technological applications of NLP and deep learning in the field of public safety and provide a review of their research progress.},

These systems have typically been developed to interact with humans in the form of speech, visual, or text conversation. As humans continue to adopt dialog systems for various objectives, there is a need to involve humans in every facet of the dialog development life cycle for synergistic augmentation of both the humans and the dialog system actors in real-world settings. We provide a holistic literature survey on the recent advancements in human-centered dialog systems (HCDS). Specifically, we provide background context surrounding the recent advancements in machine learning-based dialog systems and human-centered AI. We then bridge the gap between the two AI sub-fields and organize the research works on HCDS under three major categories (i.e., Human-Chatbot Collaboration, Human-Chatbot Alignment, Human-Centered Chatbot Design &amp; Governance). In addition, we discuss the applicability and accessibility of the HCDS implementations through benchmark datasets, application scenarios, and downstream NLP tasks.},

abstract = {Machine learning-based fault detection plays a critical role in improving the operational reliability and efficiency of wind turbines. However, existing high-performance methods typically rely on large, manually annotated training datasets, which are not readily available in the wind industry. With the fourth industrial revolution, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept that guides the operation of the real industry through the simulation, can provide easier and reliable maintenance. Therefore, this paper proposes an IIoT platform for real-time health monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes, through which a kurtosis-based automatic annotation approach to identify normal and abnormal measurements to characterize the health condition of each individual gearbox is developed. The dataset containing 22,074 measurements collected from four damaged wind turbines is employed, and the proposed method produces annotations comparable to those provided by independent domain experts. In this way, virtual-real fusion is applied to improve the integration of artificial intelligence in manufacturing, which allows a more effective condition monitoring system in the current era of Internet of Everything.},

Thus, designing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for such settings is a key social concern. Yet, explanations are often misunderstood by end-users due to being overly technical or abstract. To address this, our study engaged with police employees in the Netherlands, who are users of a text classifier. We found that for them, usability and usefulness are of great importance in explanation design, whereas interpretability and understandability are less valued. Further, our work reports on how design elements included in machine learning model explanations are interpreted. Drawing from these insights, we contribute recommendations that guide XAI system designers to cater to the specific needs of specialized users in high-stakes domains and suggest design considerations for machine learning model explanations aimed at domain experts.},

abstract = {A Collaborative Artificial Intelligence System (CAIS) performs actions in collaboration with the human to achieve a common goal. CAISs can use a trained AI model to control human-system interaction, or they can use human interaction to dynamically learn from humans in an online fashion. In online learning with human feedback, the AI model evolves by monitoring human interaction through the system sensors in the learning state, and actuates the autonomous components of the CAIS based on the learning in the operational state. Therefore, any disruptive event affecting these sensors may affect the AI model's ability to make accurate decisions and degrade the CAIS performance. Consequently, it is of paramount importance for CAIS managers to be able to automatically track the system performance to understand the resilience of the CAIS upon such disruptive events. In this paper, we provide a new framework to model CAIS performance when the system experiences a disruptive event. With our framework, we introduce a model of performance evolution of CAIS. The model is equipped with a set of measures that aim to support CAIS managers in the decision process to achieve the required resilience of the system. We tested our framework on a real-world case study of a robot collaborating online with the human, when the system is experiencing a disruptive event. The case study shows that our framework can be adopted in CAIS and integrated into the online execution of the CAIS activities.},

abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is an essential subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where agents interact with environments to learn policies for solving complex tasks. In recent years, DRL has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in various tasks, including video games, robotic control, quantitative trading, and autonomous driving. Despite its accomplishments, security and privacy-related issues still prevent us from deploying trustworthy DRL applications. For example, by manipulating the environment, an attacker can influence an agent’s actions, misleading it to behave abnormally. Additionally, an attacker can infer private training data and environmental information by maliciously interacting with DRL models, causing a privacy breach. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of security and privacy issues in the context of DRL. First, we present a holistic review of security-related attacks within DRL systems from the perspectives of single-agent and multi-agent systems and review privacy-related attacks. Second, we review and classify defense methods used to address security-related challenges, including robust learning, anomaly detection, and game theory approaches. Third, we review and classify privacy-preserving technologies, including encryption, differential privacy, and policy confusion. We conclude the survey by discussing open issues and possible directions for future research in this field.},

However, annotators can only apply labels that are available to them in the annotation classification scheme. Drawing on a 3-year ethnographic study of an R&amp;D collaboration between medical and AI researchers, we argue that the construction of the classification schema itself -- decisions about what kinds of data can and cannot be collected, what activities can and cannot be detected in the data, what the possible annotation classes ought to be, and the rules by which an item ought to be classified into each class -- dramatically shape the annotation process, and through it, the AI. We draw on Bowker and Star's [9] classification theory to detail how the creation of a training data codebook for a computer vision algorithm in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) evolved from its original, clinically-driven goal of classifying complex clinical activities into a narrower goal of identifying physical objects and simpler activities in the ICU. This work reinforces how trade-offs and decisions made long before annotators begin labeling data are highly consequential to the resulting AI system.},

This problem has substantially impeded the assimilation of generative AI-enabled Educational Technology (Ed-Tech) within the higher education domain, unlike other fields such as finance, health, and management. The prevailing sentiment among higher education practitioners remains wavering, with differing opinions on whether to permit AI comprehensively, impose complete restrictions, or allow minimal integration into academic courses. This pilot study endeavors to elucidate the nuanced determinants influencing cognitive trust of Information Technology (IT) Higher Education instructors in AI-enabled educational Technology. The implications of this trust, or lack thereof, on the broader adoption of AI in higher education, constitute a focal point of investigation in this scholarly investigation.},

abstract = {Conversation summarization, a subcategory of text summarization that aims to extract key information from a conversation, is one of the most interesting research topics because it can help conversational artificial intelligence agents, such as chatbots, better understand the content of a conversation and thus improve the performance of conversational artificial intelligence agents. Conversation summarization requires consideration of various aspects of a conversation, including the topic of the conversation, who the speakers are, and what emotions they are feeling. However, despite these important aspects, most existing studies focus on providing only content-based summaries. This is a difficult problem to solve because learning all the important aspects of a conversation can lead to catastrophic forgetting. We introduce EmoSum, a conversation summarization model that can generate better summaries reflecting not only the content of the conversation but also the emotions of the conversation, which is one of the important aspects of the conversation. We also propose a simple but effective training method to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting that may occur as the conversation summarization model learns more knowledge. Experimental results show that EmoSum trained by the proposed method outperforms baselines in generating more comprehensive and accurate summaries that reflect important aspects of the conversation, such as emotions and content.},

In particular, Artificial Intelligence is opening new opportunities for archivists and researchers. However, the experience of scholars (particularly humanities scholars) and other users remain understudied. This article asks how and why researchers and general users are, or are not, using computational methods. This research is informed by an open-call survey, completed by 22 individuals, and semi-structured interviews with 33 professionals, including archivists, librarians, digital humanists, literary scholars, historians, and computer scientists. Drawing on these results, this article offers an analysis of user experiences of computational research methods applied to digitised and born-digital archives. With a focus on humanities and social science researchers, this article also discusses users who resist this kind of research, perhaps because they lack the skills necessary to engage with these materials at scale, or because they prefer to use more traditional methods, such as close reading and historical analysis. Here, we explore the uses of computational and more “traditional” research methodologies applied to digital records. We also make a series of recommendations to elevate users’ computational skills but also to improve the digital infrastructure to make archives more accessible and usable.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can potentially revolutionise society and the economy, but their use also introduces new hazards. To ensure that AI-enabled systems are trustworthy and managed responsibly, actors involved in their development, deployment, and use must act with prudence and manage risks. This paper presents aspects of the framework for assuring AI-enabled systems in the new DNV Recommended Practice (RP): DNV-RP-0671, ”Assurance of AI-enabled systems”. The objective of the RP is to guide how to assure that AI-enabled systems are trustworthy and managed responsibly throughout their entire lifecycle. The RP is based on the following key principles: stakeholder focus, evidence-based argumentation, systems approach, risk-based approach, modularity, and lifecycle perspective. The RP provides guidance on showing compliance with applicable standards and regulations, including identification and refinement of case-specific system-wide requirements down to requirements specific to the AI component of the system. Trustworthy and responsible AI involves social and technical aspects and requires a risk management system that accommodates the iterative process of assuring AI-enabled systems. Governance is also an essential aspect of assuring trustworthy and responsible AI. The framework is flexible enough to accommodate the rapid advancements in AI technology and the differing frameworks for AI governance among regions and industries.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its applications have been widely implemented into various sectors of our life. As a pillar industry of national economy, medical and health care has been intertwined and merged with AI technology, leaving profound socioeconomic outcomes with the broad masses of the people. Therefore, it is important to analyze and cope with the influences of AI technology on the operation and development of medical institutions. "AI social experiment" as a real-world research approach that focuses on the practice and social impacts of AI technology is becoming an emerging paradigm. The current research methods of AI social experiment have two disadvantages. First, manual pre-processing is primarily used when dealing with raw text data, resulting in low efficiency overall. Secondly, the workflow based on manual pre-processing has poor robustness, which means that any slight change in research needs can lead to major adjustments or even overhaul of the entire work. This study innovatively applies the knowledge graph technology to the AI medical social experiment and proposes an optimized ontology for this scenario. Through experiments, we verify the feasibility of the method, and look into the prospects of its generalization.},

However, existing methods are always unable to discover, assess, block and repair those unknown/known vulnerabilities in a timely and effective manner. This article explores the potential of large models on vulnerability management optimization. To efficiently orchestrate complex vulnerability management tasks (e.g., detection, prioritization, and code repairing), we propose to conduct a novel Large Code-graph Model (LCM) to break down vulnerability life-cycle management into distinct suites using artificial intelligence agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and graph-structured large models to automate processes without extensive prior knowledge. In particular, we conduct an evaluation experiment utilizing the proposed LCM for pre-processing vulnerable data in the vulnerability detection suite. The results showed a final detection accuracy of 97.2%, significantly outperforming baseline models and confirming that the proposed LCM can autonomously extract superior features as a data pre-processing tool. Consequently, the experimental results also partially validate the feasibility of our proposed framework.},

Ajna addresses technical challenges in Augmented Reality (AR) devices, specifically the limitations of depth sensors and cameras. These limitations confine object detection to close proximity and hinder perception beyond immediate surroundings, through obstructions, or across different structural levels, impacting collaborative use. It harnesses the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in AR devices to measure users’ relative distances from a set physical point, enabling object detection sharing among multiple users across obstacles like walls and over distances. We tested Ajna’s effectiveness in a controlled study with 15 participants simulating emergency situations in a multi-story building. We found that Ajna improved object detection, location awareness, and situational awareness and reduced search times by 15%. Ajna’s performance in simulated environments highlights the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance sensemaking in critical situations, offering insights for law enforcement, search and rescue, and infrastructure management.},

abstract = {The progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fueled AI-powered tools like co-pilots and assistants to provision better guidance, particularly during data analysis. However, research on guidance has not yet examined the perceived efficacy of the source from which guidance is offered and the impact of this source on the user’s perception and usage of guidance. We ask whether users perceive all guidance sources as equal, with particular interest in three sources: (i) “AI,” (ii) “human expert,” and (iii) “a group of human analysts.” As a benchmark, we consider a fourth source, (iv) “unattributed guidance,” where guidance is provided without attribution to any source, enabling isolation of and comparison with the effects of source-specific guidance. We design a five-condition between-subjects study, with one condition for each of the four guidance sources and an additional (v) “no-guidance” condition, which serves as a baseline to evaluate the influence of any kind of guidance. We situate our study in a custom data preparation and analysis tool wherein we task users to select relevant attributes from an unfamiliar dataset to inform a business report. Depending on the assigned condition, users can request guidance, which the system then provides in the form of attribute suggestions. To ensure internal validity, we control for the quality of guidance across source-conditions. Through several metrics of usage and perception, we statistically test five preregistered hypotheses and report on additional analysis. We find that the source of guidance matters to users, but not in a manner that matches received wisdom. For instance, users utilize guidance differently at various stages of analysis, including expressing varying levels of regret, despite receiving guidance of similar quality. Notably, users in the AI condition reported both higher post-task benefit and regret. These findings strongly indicate the need to further understand how different guidance sources impact user behavior for designing effective guidance systems.},

However, knowing whether a text was produced by human or artificial intelligence (AI) is important to determining its trustworthiness, and has applications in many domains including detecting fraud and academic dishonesty, as well as combating the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. The task of AI-generated text (AIGT) detection is therefore both very challenging, and highly critical. In this survey, we summarize stateof-the art approaches to AIGT detection, including watermarking, statistical and stylistic analysis, and machine learning classification. We also provide information about existing datasets for this task. Synthesizing the research findings, we aim to provide insight into the salient factors that combine to determine how “detectable” AIGT text is under different scenarios, and to make practical recommendations for future work towards this significant technical and societal challenge.},

In this paper, we argue that a major concern with emotion AI technologies has to do with the theories of emotion that undergird them. Most emotion AI technologies are built on the foundations of anti-intentionalist theories of human emotion, which claim that emotions can be understood as discrete, universal states that arise as automatic physiological responses. Anti-intentionalists suggest that emotions are not directed at any object, or subject to cognitive reasons. In our work, we focus on the increasing use of these technologies in education to illustrate the ways in which these anti-intentionalist systems are problematic, as they dissolve the space for pushback against the judgements they make. We argue that their use thereby contributes to harms towards children broadly centered around student disempowerment, surveillance, and classification. We then consider three alternative policy approaches to emotion AI use in schools in light of their role with this political agenda of emotion commodification, assessing each of these options—interpretability, technical reform, and non-use—for their desirability and feasibility. In doing so, we underscore the conceptual harms produced by emotion AI systems in the context of education, and the criteria by which these technologies should be judged by educators and policymakers.},

abstract = {Developing professional communicative competence is vital for economics students, preparing them for effective communication in their future careers. Despite its significance, a research gap exists regarding the use of intelligent systems to enhance this competence in economics students. To fill this gap, this systematic mapping study investigates intelligent systems applications in human capital development, focusing on professional communicative competence development for economics students in English. The study involves a rigorous literature search and screening process, revealing diverse approaches and techniques to harness intelligent systems for human capital development. By synthesizing and analyzing these findings, this paper systematically maps the current landscape of intelligent systems' use in developing professional communicative competence among economics students. The results indicate that intelligent systems applications, including natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, offer substantial potential to improve human capital development programs. They provide personalized, adaptive, and interactive learning experiences. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of incorporating pedagogical and instructional design principles when developing intelligent systems applications for human capital development. In summary, this systematic mapping study offers insights and recommendations for researchers, educators, and practitioners interested in leveraging intelligent systems for human capital development, especially in cultivating professional communicative competence among economics students in English. Moreover, it lays the groundwork for future empirical studies assessing the effectiveness of intelligent systems applications in this context.},

Passengers free from driving would expect to undertake diverse Non-Driving-Related Tasks to keep themselves occupied. Introducing Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI) in Level 5 AVs could improve the in-vehicle user experience (UX). To explore this, firstly, we identify what roles and relationships can CAI play towards end-users of AVs through end-user interviews and thematic analysis. Secondly, we examine how end-users qualitatively assess the embodied UX of the CAI roles and relationships through guided brainstorming, post simulator interaction experiments employing Wizard of Oz setup and Participant Enactment methods. Results show that Tour Guide, Mentor, and Storyteller were the most preferred CAI roles, and that Human-CAI relationships are maintained if the CAI mediates in-vehicle user activities, interactions, sharing of vehicle control, and deep conversations. We discuss the research implications and propose design guidelines.},

abstract = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a transformative component of artificial intelligence, combining the strengths of information retrieval (IR) and generative models to tackle complex problems in diverse domains. Despite their rapid adoption and proven potential, the role of IR within RAG frameworks remains under-explored, with research often prioritising advances in generative techniques. This imbalance has left a critical gap in understanding how robust retrieval mechanisms can optimise the overall performance and reliability of RAG systems.The 1st Workshop on Information Retrieval's Role in RAG Systems (IR-RAG), held at SIGIR 2024, addressed this gap by focusing on the fundamental principles of information retrieval within the RAG paradigm. The workshop provided a dedicated platform for researchers, practitioners, and experts to share insights, foster discussions, and present innovative research highlighting the centrality of IR in RAG frameworks.Through keynote talks, oral and poster presentations, and collaborative breakout sessions, the workshop highlighted both the challenges and opportunities in refining retrieval methodologies to support the generative components of RAG systems. This event has set the stage for advancing research on IR's pivotal role in shaping the future of RAG systems.The proceedings of the workshop, published in CEUR Workshop Proceedings, are available at https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3784/.Date: 18 July 2024.Website: https://coda.io/@rstless-group/ir-rag-sigir24.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to IT systems. However, AI can be manipulated to perform undesirably, exhibit biases or abusive behaviors. When AI algorithms are parallelized on high-performance computing-based cyberinfrastructure (CI), such misbehaviors and uncertainty can multiply to obscure the root causes. Secure, safe, and reliable computing techniques can mitigate these problems. The project described in this paper aims to inform curriculum and develop materials to educate students who use AI from the outset, so that they will first become aware of the issues and secondly practical considerations will be integrated with theory in classes. Intensive, multi-faceted, modular, experiential learning units are designed to rapidly upgrade the skills of current and future CI users, so they can apply new skills to their tasks. The loosely coupled modules can be taken as standalone self-directed units or integrated into existing classes, starting with CS 1 and CS 2, which are taken by many non-CS STEM students. In a sandpit environment, learners take measured risks when guided on a journey of discovery. The primary purpose of this paper is to present key findings of the research following a 2-year pilot. A secondary purpose of the paper is to disseminate this exciting endeavor broadly, so that likeminded educators and researchers can consider participating in the project.},

abstract = {Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it crucial to integrate moral reasoning into AI systems. However, existing models and datasets often overlook regional and cultural differences. To address this shortcoming, we have expanded the JCommonsenseMorality (JCM) dataset, the only publicly available dataset focused on Japanese morality. The Extended JCM (eJCM) has grown from the original 13,975 sentences to 31,184 sentences using our proposed sentence expansion method called Masked Token and Label Enhancement (MTLE). MTLE selectively masks important parts of sentences related to moral judgment and replaces them with alternative expressions generated by a large language model (LLM), while re-assigning appropriate labels. The model trained using our eJCM achieved an F1 score of 0.857, higher than the scores for the original JCM (0.837), ChatGPT one-shot classification (0.841), and data augmented using AugGPT, a state-of-the-art augmentation method (0.850). Specifically, in complex moral reasoning tasks unique to Japanese culture, the model trained with eJCM showed a significant improvement in performance (increasing from 0.681 to 0.756) and achieved a performance close to that of GPT-4 Turbo (0.787). These results demonstrate the validity of the eJCM dataset and the importance of developing models and datasets that consider the cultural context.},

These prompts allow the metaverse to interact with GenAI, where context information, instructions, input data, or even output indications constituting the prompt can come from within the metaverse. However, their integration poses challenges regarding interoperability, lack of standards, scalability, and maintaining a high-quality user experience. This paper explores how GenAI can productively assist in enhancing creativity within the contexts of the Metaverse and unlock new opportunities. We provide a technical, in-depth overview of the different generative models for image, video, audio, and 3D content within the Metaverse environments. We also explore the bottlenecks, opportunities, and innovative applications of GenAI from the perspectives of end users, developers, service providers, and AI researchers. This survey commences by highlighting the potential of GenAI for enhancing the Metaverse experience through dynamic content generation to populate massive virtual worlds. Subsequently, we shed light on the ongoing research practices and trends in multimodal content generation, enhancing realism and creativity and alleviating bottlenecks related to standardization, computational cost, privacy, and safety. Lastly, we share insights into promising research directions toward the integration of GenAI with the Metaverse for creative enhancement, improved immersion, and innovative interactive applications.},

This paper examines the integration of two AI-driven models, ChatGPT-4.0 and its advanced iteration, GPT-4o, into the teaching of complex subjects such as climate risk management within higher education. Utilizing role-play simulations, a method proven to effectively deepen understanding and engagement, we explore how these models enhance traditional educational approaches by providing dynamic, real-time interactions that mimic real-world decision-making processes. Our comparative analysis focuses on the performance of these models in terms of response time, emotional intelligence, and quality of engagement. The findings indicate that GPT-4o, with its quicker response times and enhanced emotional recognition capabilities, significantly improves learner engagement and the effectiveness of role-play simulations. This study highlights the potential of AI to not only complement but substantially enrich pedagogical practices, offering educators valuable insights into selecting appropriate AI tools for their instructional needs. Through this exploration, we advocate for a hybrid educational model that synergistically combines the strengths of both traditional and AI-enhanced learning, proposing a future where education is more adaptive, personalized, and aligned with the evolving demands of the digital age.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {In the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of deep learning to dominate the field of artificial intelligence. Advances in artificial neural networks alongside corresponding advances in hardware accelerators with large memory capacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled practitioners to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks across several fields spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and more widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become more apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues that range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions. Collective behavior, commonly observed in nature, tends to produce systems that are robust, adaptable, and have less rigid assumptions about the environment configuration. Collective intelligence, as a field, studies the group intelligence that emerges from the interactions of many individuals. Within this field, ideas such as self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and cellular automata were developed to model and explain complex systems. It is therefore natural to see these ideas incorporated into newer deep learning methods. In this review, we will provide a historical context of neural network research’s involvement with complex systems, and highlight several active areas in modern deep learning research that incorporate the principles of collective intelligence to advance its capabilities. We hope this review can serve as a bridge between the complex systems and deep learning communities.},

With the development of artificial intelligence and the increasing maturity of machine vision technology, the application of machine vision has expanded to target the treatment of rehabilitated individuals. As a common developmental disorder, autism tends to be multimodal in its prediction, screening and treatment, and machine vision can be used for feedback training as well as various conventional rehabilitation therapies through the developed interactive rehabilitation system. It can break through the traditional single autism treatment paradigm and enable better operability and accuracy of the treatment process. This paper reviews the working principle of machine vision, and the algorithms used in machine vision for motion target detection, and finally summarizes the application of machine vision in the diagnosis and intervention treatment of early autistic patients.},

However, little is known about how OSS developers view the relative benefits and drawbacks of governmental funding compared to other funding sources. This study explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, funded by public research grants, commercial sponsorship, micro-donations, and a €32 million grant announced in France's artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn's maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions. First, it contributes empirical findings about the benefits and drawbacks of public and private funding for OSS developers, and the governance protocols employed by the maintainers to balance the diverse interests of their funders and community. Second, it offers practical lessons on funding for OSS developers, governments, and companies based on the experience of scikit-learn.

To address these challenges, this paper aims to further enhance the efficiency and service quality of power enterprise logistics management by introducing modern information technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The study adopts the design and integration of intelligent management systems, and through case studies, demonstrates how these technologies can improve the optimization of logistics resources and achieve efficient real-time monitoring.

abstract = {An impossibility theorem demonstrates that a particular problem or set of problems cannot be solved as described in the claim. Such theorems put limits on what is possible to do concerning artificial intelligence, especially the super-intelligent one. As such, these results serve as guidelines, reminders, and warnings to AI safety, AI policy, and governance researchers. These might enable solutions to some long-standing questions in the form of formalizing theories in the framework of constraint satisfaction without committing to one option. We strongly believe this to be the most prudent approach to long-term AI safety initiatives. In this article, we have categorized impossibility theorems applicable to AI into five mechanism-based categories: Deduction, indistinguishability, induction, tradeoffs, and intractability. We found that certain theorems are too specific or have implicit assumptions that limit application. Also, we added new results (theorems) such as the unfairness of explainability, the first explainability-related result in the induction category. The remaining results deal with misalignment between the clones and put a limit to the self-awareness of agents. We concluded that deductive impossibilities deny 100%-guarantees for security. In the end, we give some ideas that hold potential in explainability, controllability, value alignment, ethics, and group decision-making.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2024, held July 18-20, 2024 at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.The Learning at Scale conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. During the last few years, new opportunities for scaling up learning have emerged, like hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, and informal learning enabled by all sorts of platforms (e.g., gamified language learning, citizen science communities, and collaborative programming communities). In the recent two years, the unprecedented development of generative AI has brought profound opportunities to scale the teaching and learning experiences, with the goal of enhancing learning for the increasingly diverse group of learners in both formal and informal contexts. L@S has evolved along with these emergent massive learning scenarios and opportunities and is today one of the most prominent venues for discussion of the highest quality of research on how learning and teaching can be transformed at scale, in diverse learning environments.The theme of L@S 2024 is Scaling Learning in the Age of AI. Rapid advances in AI have created new opportunities but also challenges for the Learning@Scale community. The advances in generative AI show potential to enhance pedagogical practices and the efficacy of learning at scale. This has led to an unprecedented level of interest in employing generative AI for scaling tutoring and feedback. The prevalence of such tools calls for new practices and understanding on how AI-based methods should be designed and developed to enhance the experiences and outcomes of teachers and learners.Learning@Scale 2024 solicits empirical and theoretical papers on, but not limited to, the following topics (in no particular order): 1) Instruction at scale: studies that examine how teachers and educators scale their instructions, what aspects of instruction could be scaled effectively, and which of these instructional strategies are the most effective for learning. 2) Interventions at scale: studies that examine the effects of interventions on student learning and performance when implemented at scale. We welcome studies that use both qualitative and quantitative methods. 3) The use of generative AI to scale learning: studies that investigate stakeholders' experiences with generative AI, students' and teachers' interactions with generative AI, and the potentials and limitations of using generative AI in education. 4) Systems and tools to support learning at scale: research that designs and develops systems and tools to support learning at scale. For example, this involves scaling learning through web-based systems, MOOCs, visualization, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification, immersive techniques (AR/VR/MR), mobile technologies, tangible interfaces, and various other technologies. 5) The evaluation of existing learning at scale systems and online learning environments using but not limited to the above-mentioned technologies. 6) Methods and algorithms that model learner behavior: research that contributes methods, algorithms, and pipelines that process large student data to enhance learning at scale. 7) Scaling learning in informal contexts: studies that explore how people take advantage of online environments to pursue their interests informally. 8) Review and synthesis of existing literature related to learning at scale. 9) Empirical studies and interventions that address equity, trust, algorithmic transparency and explainability, fairness and bias when using AI in education. 10) Research that addresses accessibility in learning at scale contexts. 11) Design and deployment of learning at scale systems for learners from underrepresented groups.},

The analysis of these data is opening exciting new avenues for both studying and supporting learning. Yet, practical and logistical challenges commonly appear while deploying MMLA innovations “in-the-wild”. These can span from technical issues related to enhancing the learning space with sensing capabilities, to the increased complexity of teachers’ tasks. These practicalities have been rarely investigated. This article addresses this gap by presenting a set of lessons learnt from a 2-year human-centred MMLA in-the-wild study conducted with 399 students and 17 educators in the context of nursing education. The lessons learnt were synthesised into topics related to (i) technological/physical aspects of the deployment; (ii) multimodal data and interfaces; (iii) the design process; (iv) participation, ethics and privacy; and (v) sustainability of the deployment.},

abstract = {The technical progression of artificial intelligence (AI) research has been built on breakthroughs in fields such as computer science, statistics, and mathematics. However, in the past decade AI researchers have increasingly looked to the social sciences, turning to human interactions to solve the challenges of model development. Paying crowdsourcing workers to generate or curate data, or ‘data enrichment’, has become indispensable for many areas of AI research, from natural language processing to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Other fields that routinely interact with crowdsourcing workers, such as Psychology, have developed common governance requirements and norms to ensure research is undertaken ethically. This study explores how, and to what extent, comparable research ethics requirements and norms have developed for AI research and data enrichment. We focus on the approach taken by two leading conferences: ICLR and NeurIPS, and journal publisher Springer. In a longitudinal study of accepted papers, and via a comparison with Psychology and CHI papers, this work finds that leading AI venues have begun to establish protocols for human data collection, but these are are inconsistently followed by authors. Whilst Psychology papers engaging with crowdsourcing workers frequently disclose ethics reviews, payment data, demographic data and other information, similar disclosures are far less common in leading AI venues despite similar guidance. The work concludes with hypotheses to explain these gaps in research ethics practices and considerations for its implications.},

abstract = {The Artificial Intelligence Smart Classroom Initiative (ASCI) presents a re-imagined set of online course tools, designed primarily to support growing computer science classes. The system has four primary tools: an office hours queue, an automatic student grouping algorithm, a course-specific local large-language model (LLM), and administration tools for detecting students and TAs that need support. These tools interoperate to improve the quality of one another (e.g., LLM conversations support students directly in the office hours queue) and are enhanced by synchronizing data from multiple external sources such as Piazza, Gradescope, and Canvas. The system has been deployed in multiple courses over the past three semesters: initially as a FIFO queue, then supporting manual grouping and smart grouping of office hour attendees, and recently including LLM support. Preliminary results indicate that students who were grouped using the tool were more likely to return to the queue more than twice as often (on average) than those who were not. However, while grouping in office hours has the potential to decrease student wait times, teaching assistants and students tend to favor one-on-one meetings over group meetings. This might be improved in the future with updates to the software, TA training, and incorporation of other supporting tools (e.g., LLM technology). The other, newer, tools will be more thoroughly evaluated in future semesters.},

abstract = {Objective -The Objective of this research is to identify the key attributes of a sustainable health care supply chain. This paper presents a new, four-dimensional model, consisting of social, economic, environmental and technological dimensions. Design/Methodology/Approach-The proposed research methodology involved four independent variables leading to an efficient, sustainable SCM framework for the healthcare industry, which were identified based on the research gaps, solidly supported by latest quality literature review. The data are gathered using a Likert scale questionnaire together with a scheduled interview. The study adopted a quantitative survey approach to randomly collect and analyzed the primary data from a large sample of 400 supply chain and health care executives and was analyzed statistically using Adanco 2.3.2. The findings were further analyzed to search for areas that necessitate research to understand a sustainable SCM framework to gain a competitive edge and operational efficiency, reduce costs and improve profitability with societal impact on socio-economic, environmental factors and technological factors. Quantitative analysis tools include reliability indicators, convergent validity, discriminant validity, multicollinearity etc. All are supported by structural equation model (SEM) justifying the hypothesis formulated. Findings &amp; Research Outcome- The goals of green supply chain management are to eliminate or minimize waste, reduce environmental impacts (air and water pollution) and avoid wasting resources. It has a significant positive outcome on costs, waste disposal, resource consumption and greenhouse emissions. Technology was found to have a positive outcome on supply chain management through customized information technology, use of block chain, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, smart practices implementation, sophisticated IT applications and user-friendly smartphone interface. The use of technology improves automation, reduces counterfeit medicines and ensures secure data storage. Social dimension was found to have positive outcome on sustainable supply management through perceived value preposition, customer satisfaction index, informational quality, fair operating practices and Involvement and relationship level, which are measured by outcome of achievement of social sustainability.},

abstract = {There is a widespread agreement that society must swiftly decrease and ultimately eliminate its carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, a profound threat to the Earth’s ecosystem and humanity’s existence. Contrary to intuition, the core issue is not the escalation of energy consumption itself, but the carbon footprint resulting from that energy usage and its environmental consequences. As such, recent initiatives aimed at decarbonization in fields such as computing, construction, and transportation leverage the flexibility of energy demand to effectively diminish its associated carbon footprint. Similarly, consumer habits and routine changes have been argued to significantly achieve large energy savings. However, most approaches mainly use financial incentives, which alone cannot be employed as the primary strategy with results pointing to individuals reverting habits due to low rewards and considerable impacts into their routines. In a world where automation spans various applications, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can potentially assist consumers in reshaping daily behavior to lower carbon footprint, all while mitigating inconvenient factors associated with routine changes. In this paper, we propose a vision of using the modeling of sustainability efforts with human-in-the-loop considerations. We begin with understanding what incentivizes behavioral change among consumers. Then, we describe, illustrate, and list the challenges in using automation technologies with recommendation systems to sustain consumer engagement in day-to-day decarbonization efforts.},

abstract = {As emerging technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) pose fundamental challenges for global and domestic technological governance, the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) comes to the fore with AI as a frontrunner, generating discussions on the ethical elements of AI amongst key stakeholder groups, such as government, academia, industry, and civil society. However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the ‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea's people-centered ‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’ (국가인공지능윤리기준; ‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation. This paper hopes to contribute to theory-building in AI ethics and provide a point of comparison in the international stage for future research concerning AI ethics design and implementation.},

However, there are significant opportunities for these interfaces due to rapid advancements in multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI), which promise a future of tight coupling between humans and intelligent systems. AI-driven VIs, when integrated with other modalities, offer a robust solution for effectively capturing and interpreting user intentions and complex environmental information, thereby facilitating seamless and efficient interactions. This PhD study explores three application cases of multimodal interfaces to augment context awareness, respectively focusing on three dimensions of visual modality: scale, depth, and time: a fine-grained analysis of physical surfaces via microscopic image, precise projection of the real world using depth data, and rendering haptic feedback from video background in virtual environments.},

This case study examined the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on the WTC among Chinese university students engaged in face-to-face (F2F) interactions with a native English speaker. Employing a mixed-method approach, including a WTC questionnaire and two open-ended questions, the study involved fourteen students who engaged in AI chatbot-assisted communication practice simulating human-like dialogues prior to F2F interactions with a native English-speaking teacher outside the traditional classroom setting. The results of the WTC survey indicated positive outcomes and content analysis findings reported students exhibiting shifts from negative emotional states to positive ones. AI's role in pre-talk preparation significantly contributed to the success of students' interactions, emphasizing the value of AI chatbots in the absence of authentic communication opportunities. The study concludes that strategically integrating AI chatbot aligns with the active filter hypothesis, reducing anxiety and promoting positive WTC, thus enhancing language learning experiences.},

Recent configurations of mobility devices that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) show its ability to handle complex information like user input. We create a virtual reality environment to measure participants’ reactions to correct and incorrect feedback from an AI-assistance system. Using gaze to evaluate these reactions, we investigate whether we can automatically predict an upcoming system error. Our results show that gaze reactions occur within 300 ms when the system highlights user input, but the delay extends to 1 second without highlighting. Subject dependent gaze behavior proved complicated for developing a generalizable model based on previous work using TCNs for online recognition of upcoming errors. Therefore, more adaptable models for individuals may be a better alternative for gaze-based accessibility systems.},

This paper explores the implementation and impact of the AIED Unplugged solution in Brazil’s elementary schools, focusing on its role in reducing educational inequalities between rural and urban areas. The implemented AIED solution has key features, such as offline functionality, compatibility with low-cost devices, and integration of handwriting recognition and text production assessment using Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our impact analysis reveals that 8,238 schools adopted this technology, benefiting 164,545 students through personalized feedback and support to improve their writing skills. Data analysis shows that our AIED solution effectively supports students from rural and urban areas, with no significant differences in writing skill improvements, thus demonstrating its potential for equitable educational support. We noticed that automated pedagogical assessments, printable paper-based dashboards, and scalable AI techniques ensure that students, regardless of location, receive personalized support without overburdening teachers.

abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

Shrinking these sophisticated algorithms into small form factors with minimal computing resources and power budgets requires innovation at several layers of abstraction: software, algorithmic, architectural, circuit, and device-level innovations. However, improvements to system efficiency may impact robustness and vice-versa. Therefore, a co-design framework is often necessary to customize a system for its given application. A system that prioritizes efficiency might use circuit-level innovations that introduce process variations or signal noise into the system, which may use software-level redundancy in order to compensate. In this tutorial, we will first examine various methods of improving efficiency and robustness in edge AI and their tradeoffs at each level of abstraction. Then, we will outline co-design techniques for designing efficient and robust edge AI systems, using federated learning as a specific example to illustrate the effectiveness of co-design.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives, and its potential applications are practically limitless. However, as with any technology, there are concerns about how AI could be misused or abused. One of the most serious concerns is the potential for discrimination, particularly against women or minorities, when AI systems are used for tasks like job hiring. Additionally, there are concerns about privacy and security, as AI could be used to monitor people's movements or launch cyberattacks. To address these concerns, regulations must be developed to ensure that AI is developed and used ethically and responsibly. These regulations should address issues like safety, privacy, security, and discrimination. Finally, it is important to educate the public about AI and how to use it safely and responsibly. In this paper, I will examine the AI regulations and challenges that exist today, particularly in the United States. Two regulations I will focus on are the AI in Government Act of 2020 and the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020. Additionally, I will examine two Executive Orders that have addressed the issue of AI in the federal government. This paper examines AI generative tools, such as Bing, Bard, and Chat-GPT. Finally, the paper concludes with some policy considerations and recommendations for federal agencies.},

abstract = {Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) has been increasingly adopted by young shoppers as well as older generations because applying for a BNPL service is hassle-free compared to credit card applications. However, preventing fraudulent transactions is indispensable. In this study, machine learning techniques have been used to create fraud detection models for a BNPL company. Of the four algorithms tested, Random Forest was the top performer, with an impressive F1 score of 0.92 and a low false positive rate of 0.072. To understand how decisions are made by the random forest classifier and build human trust, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a popular explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, to interpret the model with both global and local explanations. It is discovered that the detection rules used by the company's human experts involve features deemed important by SHAP. Furthermore, we discovered other features that are useful for determining whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, which human experts have not considered before. Through XAI explanations, humans can work together with prediction models to detect fraudulent transactions and learn from each other.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a widely popular technology that will have a profound impact on society and individuals. Less than a decade ago, it was thought that creative work would be among the last to be automated&nbsp;– yet today, we see AI encroaching on many creative domains. In this paper, we present the findings of a survey study on people’s perceptions of text-to-image generation. We touch on participants’ technical understanding of the emerging technology, their fears and concerns, and thoughts about risks and dangers of text-to-image generation to the individual and society. We find that while participants were aware of the risks and dangers associated with the technology, only few participants considered the technology to be a personal risk. The risks for others were more easy to recognize for participants. Artists were particularly seen at risk. Interestingly, participants who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not tried it. This result shows that many people are still oblivious of the potential personal risks of generative artificial intelligence and the impending societal changes associated with this technology.},

abstract = {A chatbot or conversational agent is a software that can communicate with a human by using natural language. One of the essential tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing is the modeling of conversation. Since the beginning of artificial intelligence, its been the hardest challenge to create a good chatbot. Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots.In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots. Then we presented different related works to our subject, and the AI concepts needed to build an intelligent conversational agent based on deep learning models Finally, we presented a functional architecture that we propose to build an intelligent chatbot for health care assistance.},

abstract = {On-Device Artificial Intelligence (AI) services such as face recognition, object tracking and voice recognition are rapidly scaling up deployments on embedded, memory-constrained hardware devices. These services typically delegate AI inference models for execution on CPU and GPU computing backends. While GPU delegation is a common practice to achieve high speed computation, the approach suffers from degraded throughput and completion times under multi-model scenarios, i.e., concurrently executing services. This paper introduces a solution to sustain performance in multi-model, on-device AI contexts by dynamically allocating a combination of CPU and GPU backends per model. The allocation is feedback-driven, and guided by a knowledge of model-specific, multi-objective pareto fronts comprising inference latency and memory consumption. Our backend allocation algorithm that runs online per model, and achieves 25-100% improvement in throughput over static allocations as well as load-balancing scheduler solutions targeting multi-model scenarios.},

abstract = {The metaverse is a shared, immersive 3D world where individuals engage in virtual reality and exchange their interests, perspectives, and resources. User-Generated Content (UGC) serves as the core driving force in constructing the metaverse. This article concentrates on the synergistic effects of UGC and Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) within metaverse games, exploring how AI technology can unleash user creativity. Through interviews with 80 Chinese metaverse gamers aged 14-24, this study identifies user expectations for metaverse platforms to offer interactive, multi-user collaborative, multi-sensory, and emotional communication, as well as support for media integration, to facilitate the collaborative creation of UGC and AIGC. Based on the interview findings, this article proposes three mechanisms: a multi-user collaborative creation mechanism, an intelligent interactive scene generation mechanism, and a highly controllable AI generation mechanism, aiming to provide guidance and suggestions for the future development of metaverse platforms.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence can facilitate the management of large amounts of media content and enable media organisations to extract valuable insights from their data. Although AI for media understanding has made rapid progress over the recent years, its deployment in applications and professional sectors poses challenges, especially to organizations with no AI expertise. This motivated the creation of the Media Asset Annotation and Management platform (MAAM) that employs state-of-the-art deep learning models to annotate and facilitate the management of image and video assets. Annotation models provided by MAAM include automatic captioning, object detection, action recognition and moderation models, such as NSFW and disturbing content classifiers. By annotating media assets with these models, MAAM can support easy navigation, filtering and retrieval of media assets. In addition, our platform leverages the power of deep learning to support advanced visual and multi-modal retrieval capabilities. That allows accurately identifying assets that convey a similar idea, or concept even if they are not visually identical, and support a state-of-the-art reverse search facility for images and videos.},
